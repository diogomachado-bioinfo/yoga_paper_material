22557690	Place of nutrition in yoga.	Nutrition plays a very vital role in our life. Yoga and Ayurveda had laid down the foundations of dietetics. The valuable guidelines regarding various food articles and diet for Yoga Sadhaka, to achieve maximum benefits, are given in traditional yoga texts like Hatha Pradipika and Gheranda Samhitha. Now is the time to evaluate the place of nutrition in Yoga and to study how the dietetic principles in yoga will help to eradicate the national problem of Mal-nutrition and poverty which is the pressing need of the moment.

22557686	Effect of yogasana practice on systolic time intervals.	Therapeutic values of yoga practices are well documented in the ancient Indian literature. In this study an attempt has been made to see the effect of Yogasana practice on cardiac functions by measuring systolic time intervals (STI). The asanas studied are Sirsasana, Sarvangasana, Halasana, Paschimottanasana and Bhujangasana. Five healthy Yogasana practitioners who where practicing regularly for more than a year were the subjects. The result of the study was statistically analyzed and presented systematically here.

2287317	[The effect of Hatha yoga on poor posture in children and the psychophysiologic condition in adults].	Hatha Yoga's effects on the posture of 15 ten year-old children and also its effects on the psychophysical condition of 15 grown-ups was studied. As symptoms, during the first examination, 12 of the 15 children had head protrusion, 14 had shortened back extensors, all 15 had bent shoulders, relaxation of the frontal abdominal wall and shortened flexors of both the calf and thigh. The condition of all the children was remarkably better after six months of practice, some of the symptoms having completely disappeared (head protrusion, asymmetry of the shoulders, mamillas and hips, shortening of the pectoralis and back extensors), 9 children still had slight to medium relaxation of the frontal abdominal wall, 8 children still had bent shoulders, and 1 child still had shortened calf and thigh extensors. The adults were in a weak or very weak psychophysical condition, they tired easily, they complained of sleep disturbances, fluctuation of emotional state and irritability. After 3 months of practice, the vital capacity of 8 of the adults tested (53.3%) had increased by 435 ml. The time duration of apnoea had lengthened for all of the practicing adults, but with a truly large variation among them (a median of 14%). The deep waist-bend length of all the practicing adults had lengthened by an average of 9.5 cm, and the average length increase for the 3-minute running test was 42 m. All those who practiced, had experienced an alleviation of psychic difficulties.	Savic, K;Pfau, D;Skoric, S;Pfau, J;Spasojevic, N	1990
2246104	Treatment needs of alcohol-dependent women.	Research has suggested specific features of alcohol-dependent women in comparison with men. The women usually display: (1) solitary drinking; (2) neurotic and family problems; (3) risk of early health impairment; and (4) abuse of other drugs. These factors should be taken into account in therapy. The in-patient program described is based on the principles of a therapeutic community and systems theory. It includes group and family therapy, education, relaxation training, yoga, a therapeutic club for former in-patients, and use of drugs such as disulfiran. Alcohol-dependence in women has become a growing problem. Adequate therapy is needed, but prevention is even more important.	Nespor, K	1990
2218645	Belief in the efficacy of alternative medicine among general practitioners in The Netherlands.	A survey among 293 GPs in the Netherlands showed that many believe in the efficacy of common alternative procedures. High scores were especially found for manual therapy, yoga, acupuncture, hot bath therapy and homoeopathy. Other procedures, such as iridology, faith healing and many food supplements, were considered less useful.	Knipschild, P;Kleijnen, J;ter Riet, G	1990
2130287	Changed pattern of regional glucose metabolism during yoga meditative relaxation.	Using positron emission tomography (PET), measurements of the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRGlc) are able to delineate cerebral metabolic responses to external or mental stimulation. In order to examine possible changes of brain metabolism due to Yoga meditation PET scans were performed in 8 members of a Yoga meditation group during the normal control state (C) and Yoga meditative relaxation (YMR). Whereas there were intraindividual changes of the total CMRGlc, the alterations were not significant for intergroup comparison; specific focal changes or changes in the interhemispheric differences in metabolism were also not seen; however the ratios of frontal vs. occipital rCMRGlc were significantly elevated (p less than 0.05) during YMR. These altered ratios were caused by a slight increase of frontal rCMRGlc and a more pronounced reduction in primary and secondary visual centers. These data indicate a holistic behavior of the brain metabolism during the time of altered state of consciousness during YMR.

2795647	The integrated approach of yoga: a therapeutic tool for mentally retarded children: a one-year controlled study.	Ninety children with mental retardation of mild, moderate and severe degree were selected from four special schools in Bangalore, India. Forty-five children underwent yogic training for one academic year (5 h in every week) with an integrated set of yogic practices, including breathing exercises and pranayama, sithilikarana vyayama (loosening exercises), suryanamaskar, yogasanas and meditation. They were compared before and after yogic training with a control group of 45 mentally retarded children matched for chronological age, sex, IQ, socio-economic status and socio environmental background who were not exposed to yoga training but continued their usual school routine during that period. There was highly significant improvement in the IQ and social adaptation parameters in the yoga group as compared to the control group. This study shows the efficacy of yoga as an effective therapeutic tool in the management of mentally retarded children.	Uma, K;Nagendra, H R;Nagarathna, R;Vaidehi, S;Seethalakshmi, R	1989 Oct

2625731	[Problems regarding the examination in forensic medicine].	Problems encountered regarding the examination in forensic pathology are variable, even if the field of interest in limited to trauma alone. The most important problem appears to be the establishment of a causal relationship between the trauma and the death of the victim. From the materials I have contributed concerning examinations in forensic medicine, the problems inherent in the examination of the victim of traumatic shock may be introduced. The results from animal studies, which have been attempted to provide an experimental background to support the observations, are also discussed. My personal opinions on several trial cases in which there was a disagreement of opinion regarding the examination results will also be expressed. 1. Distinguishing death due to traumatic shock from death due to disease In the "Yacht school" incident, children with emotional disturbances and youths with a history of misconduct were treated with training which included physical punishment. Autopsy findings were compared between a 13-year old boy who was concluded to have died of traumatic shock from numerous beatings and a 21-year old youth who died of hemorrhagic pneumonia. In my opinion, a causative role of injury in the death was found in both cases. 2. Shock due to tourniquet This autopsy case concerns a 23-year-old male who entered a yoga training center, was tightly bound with a rope and died on the 8th day. Histological examination revealed thrombus formation in the small blood vessels and leukocyte agglutination within the blood vessels of the alveolar wall, suggesting DIC. While these findings were thought to be almost indistinguishable from those found in traumatic shock, the background conditions, including hunger, dehydration and hypothermia cannot be neglected in the evaluation. 3. Child abuse In one incident, a mother and her lover beat a 25-month old girl every day until her death. The original examination concluded that the cause of death was traumatic shock due to multiple trauma over the entire body caused by both adults. A second examination concluded that the cause of death was delayed suffocation due to binding of the chest and compression against a mattress. Based on an overall evaluation of the circumstances at the time of detection (including photographic evidence) as well as the contents of the statement made by the lover, I inferred that the head-down hanging of the child in the bathtub by the lover was directly related to the cause of death. In my opinion, the liability of the two adults in the crime was not the same.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	Naitow, M	1989 Oct
2803624	Improving aerobic capacity in healthy older adults does not necessarily lead to improved cognitive performance.	The effects of aerobic exercise training in a sample of 85 older adults were investigated. Ss were assigned randomly to either an aerobic exercise group, a nonaerobic exercise (yoga) group, or a waiting-list control group. Following 16 weeks of the group-specific protocol, all of the older Ss received 16 weeks of aerobic exercise training. The older adults demonstrated a significant increase in aerobic capacity (cardiorespiratory fitness). Performance on reaction-time tests of attention and memory retrieval was slower for the older adults than for a comparison group of 24 young adults, and there was no improvement in the older adults' performance on these tests as a function of aerobic exercise training. Results suggest that exercise-related changes in older adults' cognitive performance are due either to extended periods of training or to cohort differences between physically active and sedentary individuals.

2768768	Cardiovascular and behavioral effects of aerobic exercise training in healthy older men and women.	The cardiovascular and behavioral adaptations associated with a 4-month program of aerobic exercise training were examined in 101 older men and women (mean age = 67 years). Subjects were randomly assigned to an Aerobic Exercise group, a Yoga and Flexibility control group, or a Waiting List control group. Prior to and following the 4-month program, subjects underwent comprehensive physiological and psychological evaluations. Physiological measures included measurement of blood pressure, lipids, bone density, and cardiorespiratory fitness including direct measurements of peak oxygen consumption (VO2) and anaerobic threshold. Psychological measures included measures of mood, psychiatric symptoms, and neuropsychological functioning. This study demonstrated that 4 months of aerobic exercise training produced an overall 11.6% improvement in peak VO2 and a 13% increase in anaerobic threshold. In contrast, the Yoga and Waiting List control groups experienced no change in cardiorespiratory fitness. Other favorable physiological changes observed among aerobic exercise participants included lower cholesterol levels, diastolic blood pressure levels, and for subjects at risk for bone fracture, a trend toward an increase in bone mineral content. Although few significant psychological changes could be attributed to aerobic exercise training, participants in the two active treatment groups perceived themselves as improving on a number of psychological and behavioral dimensions.

2594536	Health status of nurses and yoga. I. Baseline data.	In this ongoing ICMR project on "Effect of Yoga on the Health of Nurses", some baseline data on the health of nurses of Nehru Hospital, P.G.I., Chandigarh are reported. This was obtained before the start of yoga therapy in selected cases and collected with the help of six psychological tools. Out of a total of 501 nurses, 452 (90.2%) could be contacted and studied. Mean age was 30.43 years and mean years of service 9.93 years. Mean scores on the psychological tests indicated poor health status of nurses, average neuroticism, depressive tendencies and role stress. Sense of Well-Being was high in them. The data is discussed in the light of researches in this area. This is the first of a series of three articles to be published in the Journal.

21927394	Factors influencing treatment acceptance in neurotic patients referred for yoga therapy-;an exploratory study.	A total of 186 neurotic patients seeking treatment in the psychiatry outpatient clinic of the Nehru Hospital, P.G.I.M.E.R. were assigned consequently to three treatments i.e. Yoga therapy (Y), Yogic Relaxation (YR) and Chemotherapy (C). A record was kept of the number of visits made by each patient during the 5 months study period. In order to find out the factors associated with treatment acceptance, a comparison was made of those subjects who completed 4-6 weeks of treatment with those who dropped out before completing the treatment in the yoga group. The dropouts and non-dropouts were found to be comparable on sociodemographic and clinical variables. They were also similar with regard to the attitude to yoga. The only factor which distinguished the two groups was the severity of illness at intake. Those who continued treatment had significantly higher scores on the P. G. I. Health Questionnaire N-2 and the clinical ratings of the severity of illness. Further, analysis of stage at which dropout occurred, and the responses to the reply paid questionnaire indicated that treatment failure as not the main reason for dropout.

2669722	Treatment of essential hypertension with yoga relaxation therapy in a USAF aviator: a case report.	A 46-year-old Caucasian male USAF aviator with a 6-year history of mild essential hypertension (medical waiver for flight duty) under unsuccessful treatment with hydrochlorothiazide, dietary modification, and exercise, was subsequently trained in yoga relaxation. After 6 weeks, medication had been discontinued, and his diastolic blood pressure remained within normal levels. The patient was subsequently returned to full flight status without recurrence of diastolic hypertension at followup 6 months later. Relaxation training, of which yoga is one type, has been reported in the medical literature to have wide clinical application. It should be considered as a nonpharmacological therapy adjunct or alternative for medical disorders among personnel in occupations (e.g., aviation) where the side effects from medications are of great concern and could be disqualifying from those duties.

2762093	Left-arm dominance in active positioning.	The relative accuracy of the left and the right arms in active positioning was studied in a group of 24 male right-handed undergraduates. The task required active positioning of the left and right arms at each of the four angular positions (30 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees, and 75 degrees). The left arm was more accurate in active positioning than the right arm. There was a progressive increase in error for both arms as the arms flexed more in reducing the angle at the joint. Results are discussed in light of suggestions concerning the superiority of the right hemisphere in the processing of kinesthetic and proprioceptive information.

2593656	Effect of yogic training on serum LDH levels.	LDH is a glycolytic enzyme utilised during exercise to provide energy to contracting muscles. Chronic submaximal exercise for a longer duration shows about two-fold increase in LDH levels. Yogic practises might be bringing similar effects. The present work was designed to study effect of yogic training on LDH levels. Fourteen female and six male students of average age or 18 years were subjected to yogic training for six weeks. Serum LDH levels were found before and after the training course by spectrophotometric method of Henry et al. The serum LDH levels were within normal limits and showed significant increase both in females and males after yogic training. It indicates that Yoga has similar effect on LDH levels like endurance training.	Pansare, M S;Kulkarni, A N;Pendse, U B	1989 Jun
2714127	Voluntary relaxation of the external anal sphincter.	In this study five volunteers with special training in anal sphincter exercise (Scandinavian Yoga School) managed voluntarily to reduce anal pressure. The mean reduction of anal pressure was 20 mm Hg. In one of the subjects, this was shown by manometry during low spinal anesthesia and electromyography to be caused by relaxation of the external anal sphincter.

2777359	Effect of yogasanas on the visual and auditory reaction time.	Visual and auditory reaction time (VRT, ART) was studied in 83 healthy male subjects of 30-40 years of age who had never practiced yogasanas before. These subjects were divided into two groups viz. Group A whose VRT and ART was determined after 1 hr. yogasanas and Group B whose ART and VRT was determined after 6 weeks yogasanas training programme. VRT and ART showed a significant reduction in Group A (P less than .05) and Group B (P less than .001).	Malathi, A;Parulkar, V G	1989 Apr-Jun

2919018	Treatment of premenstrual symptoms in Wellington women.	A survey of 1826 women in the Wellington region was carried out. Participants were asked about their general and gynaecological health, as well as detailed questions about their last menstrual cycle. The majority (1456) had had a menstrual period within the last month or so. Eighty five percent of these women noted premenstrual symptoms of some kind, and were asked about a variety of self-help measures, and medical help, for these, and whether the advice and/or treatment was in fact helpful. Nine hundred and ninety women had tried self-help while four hundred and sixteen had sought medical help. The most commonly tried self-help measures were exercise, rest and vitamin B6. Half the women had tried each of these. Overall, there was a marked placebo response, but exercise, rest and keeping a written diary of symptoms were all helpful in over eighty percent of those who tried them. Doctors offered a wide range of treatments, including vitamin B6, diuretics, oral contraceptives and mefanamic acid, but the effect of these was difficult to evaluate further. When the sample was subdivided into clusters of women who shared similar symptoms, significant differences in the effectiveness of different self help measures emerged. Four different premenstrual syndromes are suggested: PMS-breast, PMS-bloat, PMS-irritable and intolerant, and PMS-various.	Pullon, S R;Reinken, J A;Sparrow, M J	1989 Feb 22

2634333	[Psychotherapy with expressive technics in psychotic patients].	In February 1984, it was decided to resort to non-verbal expressive techniques as a suitable way for doing group psychotherapy with psychotic patients. A corporal language technique was selected which comprised (a) sense-perception elements, (b) corporal expression, and (c) yoga, arranged in five-step sessions: space acknowledgment, deep-breathing exercise, palpation of an osteoarticular structure, motility test of the previously palpated zone, and expressive exercise. Such an experiment was carried out with a group of psychotic patients, another group with psychosomatic symptoms, and a third, changeable, heterogenous group, with, obviously, a control group. Observations were made of patients' behavior during sessions, and their clinical progress throughout. All patients showed good response to the movement proposals, and no emotional excesses were detected. It was clinically observed that, in all cases, sociability improved, and anxiety decreased--in this connection, medication could be cut down accordingly. As regards 2 schizophrenic female patients, biological therapy could be ruled out.	Jordan, N	1989 Jan-Jun

2495404	Health and health care--a Hindu perspective.	In the Hindu tradition, 'health' means the continued maintenance of the best possible working of the human body under normal, and sometimes even abnormal, environmental conditions. Hindu religious teaching on healthy living and ethical considerations culminate in spiritual objectives if the injunctions contained in the system are followed. Hatha yoga is a system of bodily care that is conducive to such health, which also corrects disease via the regulation of muscular action and in other ways. Other systems of medicine, such as Ayurveda and other traditional systems in Hindu culture, have been devised for the good of humanity. It is, however, the holistic approach to health in Hinduism that calls attention to such causes of ill health as climatic extremes, bacterial attack, nutritional deviance, stress, and other forms of emotional imbalance. A state of good health is within the reach of most persons if they cultivate habits that are conducive to physical and spiritual well-being. The concept of preventive medicine is probably also based on the tenet that the attainment of good health is a religious duty, and corresponding injunctions are found in abundance in Hindu scriptures. It is not the training of students in the medical profession that is most important for health care, but rather their concern for health and their willingness to apply themselves to the observation of the rules they would wish their patients to observe.

3215678	Autonomic responses to breath holding and its variations following pranayama.	Autonomic responses to breath holding were studied in twenty healthy young men. Breath was held at different phases of respiration and parameters recorded were Breath holding time, heart rate systolic and diastolic blood pressure and galvanic skin resistance (GSR). After taking initial recordings all the subjects practised Nadi-Shodhana Pranayama for a period of 4 weeks. At the end of 4 weeks same parameters were again recorded and the results compared. Baseline heart rate and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) showed a rendency to decrease and both these autonomic parameters were significantly decreased at breaking point after pranayamic breathing. Although the GSR was recorded in all subjects the observations made were not conclusive. Thus pranayama breathing exercises appear to alter autonomic responses to breath holding probably by increasing vagal tone and decreasing sympathetic discharges.

The case is reported of a yoga practitioner who, during an exacerbation of asthma, developed a substantial increase in serum muscle enzymes. This was related to his yoga breathing exercises, which he used to enhance the delivery of aerosolised bronchodilators. As his condition improved and the use of these yoga manoeuvres diminished, the muscle enzyme levels fell to normal.	Tamarin, F M;Conetta, R;Brandstetter, R D;Chadow, H	1988 Sep
3198241	Effect of short term yoga practice on ventilatory function tests.	Twentyfive normal male volunteers undergoing a ten weeks course in the practice of yoga have been studied by some parameters of ventilatory functions tests. The observations recorded at the end of ten weeks of the course have shown improved ventilatory functions in the form of lowered respiratory rate, increased forced vital capacity, FEV1, maximum breathing capacity and breath holding time, while tidal volume and %FEV1, did not reveal any significant change. Thus, a combined practice of yoga seems to be beneficial on respiratory efficiency.	Makwana, K;Khirwadkar, N;Gupta, H C	1988 Jul-Sep
3372156	Topographic EEG brain mapping during Yogic Flying.	Voluntary focal activity typically disrupts EEG alpha activity. This experiment tested the hypothesis that the alpha wave would not be disrupted during "Yogic Flying" (YF), a TM-Sidhi technique that produces movement of the body such as hopping, because the technique operates at a self-referral level in which attention remains in a settled, inwardly directed state. In 23 subjects YF was compared with voluntary jumping in the same subjects which mimicked the movements of YF. The percentage of relative power of alpha was significantly higher for YF in virtually all EEG derivations, supporting the hypothesis. The effect appeared to be of similar magnitude in all cortical areas.	Orme-Johnson, D W;Gelderloos, P	1988 Feb
22557607	"Shankha prakshalana" (gastrointestinal lavage) in health and disease.	Shankha Prakshalana is an easy and effective technique for cleansing the gastrointestinal canal, thereby removing all the autointoxicants present in the alimentary canal. Moreover, it is a very economical procedure which can be performed by the patients at his own residence. The role of Shankha Prakshalana from our own experience is very effective in overcoming the irritable bowel syndrome. Shankha Prakshalana may also be given to the patients of anxiety neurosis with satisfactory results. Its role in the treatment of renal disorder is encouraging in early cases only. However, in the second and third degree chronic renal failure cases its role is yet to be established and needs further investigation. Similarly, in the case of thyrotoxicosis no conclusive evidence could be observed due to very limited number of cases.	Singh, S N;Jaiswal, V;Maurya, S P	1988 Jan

3064843	Rehabilitation of drug-addicted persons: the experience of the Nav-Chetna Center in India.	The Nav-Chetna Drug De-addiction and Rehabilitation Center, Varanasi, India, was established in December 1985. It provides out-patient and residential rehabilitation services, medical treatment, counseling, educational and vocational guidance, yoga therapy and after care. Drug-dependent persons under rehabilitation treatment at the Center are encouraged and helped to promote personal development, to build up and strengthen their initiative and confidence and to bring about improvements in their maturation, attitude and behaviour to overcome drug addiction. This is accomplished through a therapeutic-oriented programme, which creates conditions that optimize the natural tendency of the individual to self-actualize and eventually stabilize. Yoga plays a crucial role in this programme at both pre- and post-clinical stages. It offers a new avenue for positive mental and physical health and helps to free individuals from drug dependency and its associated problems.	Sharma, K;Shukla, V	1988
3060312	EEG findings during special psychical state (Qi Gong state) by means of compressed spectral array and topographic mapping.	Wallace first reported the changes in EEG during transcendental mediation [6]. Banquet [1] observed, on the basis of spectral analysis of the EEG, that the mediation state was a unique state of consciousness, and separate from wakefulness, drowsiness or sleep. The Qi Gong of China is not the same as either transcendental mediation or the Yoga Gong. The EEG during Qi Gong state is clearly different from those recorded during the resting state. The changes in the EEG during the Qi Gong have not been reported previously. The EEG alpha activity during the Qi Gong state occurs predominantly in the anterior regions. The peak frequency of EEG alpha rhythm is slower than the resting state. The change of EEG during Qi Gong between anterior and posterior half is negative correlation. These changes are statistically significant.	Zhang, J Z;Zhao, J;He, Q N	1988
22557593	Energy medicine.	Energy medicine is the most comprehensive concept introduced in medical diagnostics and therapy to account for a whole range of phenomena and methods available to help an individual proceed from sickness to health. The modern medical theories do not account for, much less accept many traditional therapies due to deep suspicion that the older methods are not scientific. However, the Holistic Health groups around the world have now created an environment for therapies which work at subtle energy inputs, at the cellular and molecular levels. Moreover, there are other - as yet unexplainable - energy fields which are being utilized to rebalance the Body-Mind-Spirit triad in an individual. A brief introduction is provided to these subtle energy inputs and methods of manipulation of the vital forces in the sick. Many ancient health technologies such as Yoga, Ayurveda, Acupuncture etc have proposed and work under different energy movement in the body. These are all Energy Medical Systems whose efficacy is beyond any doubt in therapeutics. Thus, Energy Medicine forms a broad based system and its introduction is important to widen the scope and content of medical therapy so that optimal treatment of the sick is possible.

21927248	Relationship between the patient's attitude towards yoga and the treatment outcome.	Correlations were obtained between scores on the P.G.I. Yoga Attitude Scale and improvement in a group of 20 psychoneurotic patients undertaking yoga therapy of 4-6 weeks duration. A significant positive correlation was found between the improvement in social and vocational disability and scores on the P.G.I Yoga Attitude Scale at intake. However, during treatment and followup, there was a significant change in the attitude towards yoga - it became more positive. Correlations were also performed between improvement and change in attitude over the 5-month study period. Significant positive correlation was seen only on personal distress. Improvement in the other symptoms of neurosis i.e. anxiety, depression, musculo-cutaneous features, vegetative symptoms of neurosis i.e. anxiety, depression, musculo-cutaneous features, vegetative symptoms and the other neurotic features i.e. hysteria, hypochondriasis, obsessions-compulsions and phobia did not show any relationship with the patient's attitude towards yoga.

3581587	Epidemiology. The incidence and management of joint contracture in India.	An epidemiologic study in India showed that 50% of the severely disabled (1.8% of the total population) had locomotor disorders. There is a considerable difference in the incidence of disability and disease in rural and urban populations. The deformities from poliomyelitis are encountered predominantly in the rural areas (53.5%). The incidence in urban areas is only 1%. After poliomyelitis, the pathomechanics of deformity are prominent in the lower limbs. In a developing country, the management of contractures differs considerably from treatment in economically advanced nations. The use of postural exercises with body weight is well illustrated by certain Yoga postures such as paschimottansana or ushtrasana and is a prescribed treatment.	Mukherjee, A K;Mokashi, M G	1987 Jun

Some 40 accredited aftercare clinics are available for inpatient cancer aftercare, since 1981 also for immediately post-acute treatment courses. These clinics are used for both, the frequent physical treatment aftermath from oncological diseases in the otological or gynaecological field, and for psychic stabilization when psychosocial problems arise. Participation in autogeneous relaxation training, yoga, and/or psychotherapeutic services are found to entail improved disease coping. Concrete patient care expectancies primarily center around movement therapy, lymphatic drainage (in breast carcinoma), speech therapy (in laryngectomees), pain control, but are also directed at psychosocial care in terms of achieving" inner calmness and relaxation". Given the age distribution seen, increasing the quality of life takes priority over restoration of the working capacity.	Schwidurski-Maib, G;Jochheim, K A	1987 May

It was noted that: the acceleration of venous return in the foot was expiratory in the recumbent position and inspiratory in the standing position; dorsiflexion (leg on foot or toes on heel) caused a more pronounced spurt phenomenon than plantar flexion; massage repeated at high frequency is less beneficial for venous return than slower massage, which allows better adaptation of venous compliance.

3505533	Kunjal: a nonspecific protective factor in management of bronchial asthma.	Seven asthmatic patients having nocturnal symptoms performed a yogic maneuver called Kunjal. Definite improvement was noticed subjectively and objectively in six patients during the week Kunjal was performed, and improvement in symptoms persisted into the third week in five patients.

3443597	Effect of respiratory exercises on asthma. The Pink City lung exerciser.	Twelve subjects with mild asthmatic episodes in the form of nocturnal precipitation were studied. A two-week schedule of placebo administration, pranayamic breathing exercises using a Pink City lung exerciser alone, and exercises using the lung exerciser with hot, humid air were performed. Five of the 12 asthmatics showed highly significant increases in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) with the lung exerciser alone, while eight of the 12 cases showed highly significant increases in PEFR with exercise using hot, humid air. The frequency of nocturnal wheezing also declined. It can be inferred that slow breathing alone and in combination with hot, humid air has a nonspecific bronchoprotective or bronchorelaxing effect.

3790030	A space-time model of health.	A space-time model of health requires a profound re-thinking of many of our basic tenets. This modern view of man and his world discards the traditional mechanistic paradigm which has been the focus of Western scientific thought and medicine. Stress related disorders are thought to be a result in part of an individual's perception of linear time. Holistic strategies such as biofeedback, relaxation skills, hypnosis, yoga, and imagery, to name a few, ask the individual to step outside linear or objective time by expanding their sense of experiential or subjective time and consciousness. It is suggested that training the time sense is a tool of holistic medicine and a space-time model of health.	Burke, J B	1986 Nov
22557558	Mental depression and kundalini yoga.	In cases of mental depression, the plasma serotonin, melatonin and glutamate levels are increased along with the lowering of urinary - 5 - hydroxyindole acetic acid, plasma monoamine oxidase and cortisol levels following three and six months Practice of Kundalini Yoga. The pulse rate and blood pressure in these patients are also lowered after Kundalini Yoga practice. Thus, the practice of Kundalini Yoga helps to maintain a perfect homeostasis by bringing an equilibrium between the sympathetic and parasympathetic activities and it can be used as a non - medical measure in treating patients with mental depression.

3570435	Effect of yoga type breathing on heart rate and cardiac axis of normal subjects.	Effect of inspiratory and expiratory phases of normal quiet breathing, deep breathing and savitri pranayam type breathing on heart rate and mean ventricular QRS axis was investigated in young, healthy untrained subjects. Pranayam type breathing produced significant cardioacceleration and increase in QRS axis during the inspiratory phase as compared to eupnea. On the other hand, expiratory effort during pranayam type breathing did not produce any significant change in heart rate or QRS axis. The changes in heart rate and QRS axis during the inspiratory and expiratory phases of pranayam type breathing were similar to the changes observed during the corresponding phases of deep breathing.

3755416	Alternative medicine consultations and remedies in patients with the irritable bowel syndrome.	The use of alternative medicine was assessed by questionnaire in 96 patients with irritable bowel syndrome, 143 patients with organic upper gastrointestinal disorders and 222 patients with Crohn's disease of comparable age and sex. Significantly more patients with the irritable bowel syndrome (16%) had consulted practitioners of alternative medicine about their condition than had patients in either of the other groups. Similarly, significantly more irritable bowel syndrome patients said they would consult an alternative medicine practitioner (41%) if conventional treatment failed. Current usage of alternative medicine remedies was significantly greater in the irritable bowel syndrome patients (11%) than in patients with Crohn's disease (4%) and tended to be greater than in patients with organic upper gastrointestinal disorders (6%). This study has shown that the use of alternative medicine is common in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and this does not appear to be explicable in terms of the nature, chronicity or refractoriness to treatment of symptoms.

3818038	Effect of yoga on exercise tolerance in normal healthy volunteers.	Twelve normal healthy volunteers (6 males and 6 females) undergoing yoga training for 90 days were studied for the effect of yoga on exercise tolerance. Their ages ranged from 18 to 28 years. The volunteers were taught only Pranayama for the first 20 days and later on yogic asanas were added. Sub-maximal exercise tolerance test was done on a motorized treadmill by using Balke's modified protocol, initially, after 20 days (Phase-I) and after 90 days of yoga training (Phase-II). Pyruvate and lactate in venous blood and blood gases in capillary blood were estimated immediately before and after the exercise. Minute ventilation and oxygen consumption were estimated before and during the test. Post exercise blood lactate was elevated significantly during initial and Phase-I, but not in Phase-II. There was significant reduction of minute ventilation and oxygen consumption only in males in Phase-I and II at the time when the volunteers reached their 80% of the predicted heart rate. Female volunteers were able to go to higher loads of exercise in Phase-I and II.

3745111	An integrated approach of yoga therapy for bronchial asthma: a 3-54-month prospective study.	After an initial integrated yoga training program of 2 to 4 weeks, 570 bronchial asthmatics were followed up for 3 to 54 months. The training consisted of yoga practices--yogasanas, Pranayama, meditation, and kriyas--and theory of yoga. Results show highly significant improvement in most of the specific parameters. The regular practitioners showed the greatest improvement. Peak expiratory flow rate (PFR) values showed significant movement of patients toward normalcy after yoga, and 72, 69, and 66% of the patients have stopped or reduced parenteral, oral, and cortisone medication, respectively. These results establish the long-term efficacy of the integrated approach of yoga therapy in the management of bronchial asthma.	Nagendra, H R;Nagarathna, R	1986

Three brief tests that assess perceptual-motor speed and two that assess nonverbal intelligence were administered to individuals who were practicing the Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi programme. Multiple regression analyses showed that when motivation (measured on a 5-point self-rating scale), age, sex, education, and duration of practice of the Transcendental Meditation technique were held constant, number of months of practice of the TM-Sidhi programme significantly predicted higher performance on two of the perceptual-motor speed tests and both tests of intelligence. Age predicted lower scores on the same tests.	Jedrczak, A;Toomey, M;Clements, G	1986 Jan

3931802	Yoga for bronchial asthma: a controlled study.	Fifty three patients with asthma underwent training for two weeks in an integrated set of yoga exercises, including breathing exercises, suryanamaskar, yogasana (physical postures), pranayama (breath slowing techniques), dhyana (meditation), and a devotional session, and were told to practise these exercises for 65 minutes daily. They were then compared with a control group of 53 patients with asthma matched for age, sex, and type and severity of asthma, who continued to take their usual drugs. There was a significantly greater improvement in the group who practised yoga in the weekly number of attacks of asthma, scores for drug treatment, and peak flow rate. This study shows the efficacy of yoga in the long term management of bronchial asthma, but the physiological basis for this beneficial effect needs to be examined in more detail.

In three experiments the kinesthetic figural aftereffect was measured prior to and after either a physical fitness program, a course in yoga, or training in Transcendental Meditation. Each program lasted a minimum of 8 wk. Subjects completing fitness training, all of whom were initially classified as augmenters, became reducers by the end of their program. Subjects enrolled in yoga and meditation courses remained relatively stable in their perceptual tendencies.	Campbell, J F;Stenstrom, R J;Bertrand, D	1985 Aug

4036529	EEG patterns suggestive of shifted levels of excitation effected by hathayogic exercises.	Concurrent with the performance of hathayogic exercises such as Nauli, Bhastrika and Suryabhedana, three characteristic EEG patterns were identified: a "wicket" rhythm at a frequency wave of 12 to 17 Hz, recordable from para-Rolandic areas, which we have called Xi rhythm; a 26-33 Hz sinusoidal activity, confined to the mid-sagittal parietooccipital region; and paroxysmal activity localized in the lateral boundaries of parieto-temporo-occipital regions, bilaterally. - The expectation that hathayogic exercises would affect the electrical activity of circumscribed, relatively well defined areas of the brain was based on the fact that these exercises imply a strong stimulation of somatic and splanchnic receptors, the afferent impulses of which are fed into specific cortical representation areas localized for the most part around central and anterior parietal areas.

6740553	Influence of yoga on blood coagulation.	Yoga is known to induce beneficial effects on physiological, biochemical and mental functions in man. Its effects on blood coagulation are not known. A study was conducted in seven previously untrained male adults who underwent a combination of yogic exercises, daily for one hour, over a period of four months. Parameters of blood coagulation were estimated before and after the end of yoga training. The following changes were observed: Fibrinolytic activity increased significantly with a concomitant fall in fibrinogen; activated partial thromboplastin time and platelet aggregation time were prolonged; blood and plasma platelets showed a rise; and both haemoglobin and heamatocrit were raised at the end of the training. These findings suggest that yoga induces a state of blood hypocoagulability. The impact of yoga on prevention of cardiovascular and thrombotic disorders is obvious.

6562134	A study of yoga as a nursing intervention in the care of patients with pleural effusion.	'Pranayama' or yogic breathing as a method of re-expansion of lungs in patients with pleural effusion was studied. Ten patients with pleural effusion practised alternate nostril breathing for 20 days after aspiration of fluid. An equal number matched for age and smoking habits underwent routine physiotherapy of the hospital for the same period. Lung function was measured: before aspiration; immediately after aspiration; and, 5, 10, 15 and 20 days after aspiration. The FVC, FEV1, MVV, PEFR, CE and RS, were used to measure lung function. The difference between the two groups in the gain in lung expansion as assessed by the above measures was tested for significance with appropriate nonparametric statistical tests at 0.1 level of significance. The results revealed that the patients practising Pranayama demonstrated a quicker re-expansion of the lungs in most of the measures of lung function. The findings are discussed in relation to implications for nursing care.	Prakasamma, M;Bhaduri, A	1984 Mar

6711713	Current therapies and the ancient East.	Current therapies, their theories and techniques ebb and flow in popularity, but there is a residue of basic principles and practices which remain. Much of this useful residue has been present in ancient Eastern religions and philosophies. This article compares the content of several current theories of individual, group, and family therapies to seed ideas in ancient Taoist, Zen, Confucian, yoga, and Buddhist source materials. Gestalt, existential, psychoanalytic, transactional analysis, cognitive-behavioral and family therapy concepts are traced to these ancient precursors. Illustrative examples are presented such as satori (flash of insight), koans (insight riddles), parables, yanas (exercises), rituals, and written teachings. The article concludes with the Four Noble Truths and the 8-fold path of Buddhism, given 2500 years ago but very timely to contemporary problems of life adjustment and a useful guide to counseling and therapy.

6481662	Physical fitness level and autonomic reactivity to psychosocial stress.	Two studies explored the influence of aerobic fitness level on autonomic reactivity to psychosocial stress. Experiment 1 employed a correlational, repeated measures design. A total of 45 men who were physically trained, untrained, or training were tested at three-week intervals over nine weeks. The measure of autonomic reactivity was lability in electrodermal activity during two speeded mental tasks designed to induce psychosocial stress. In the initial test session, trained subjects showed faster autonomic recovery from this stress than did untrained or training subjects; in subsequent test sessions involving the repeated administration of the same tasks, the three groups were indistinguishable. Experiment 2 employed 60 subjects who were randomly assigned to 10-week aerobic exercise, meditation, or music appreciation programs. In each session, two psychosocial stressors selected from a battery of six tasks were counterbalanced across treatments and sessions. Over the course of the study, participants in the exercise program improved significantly in physical fitness and also showed faster recovery in the electrodermal response. This quicker autonomic recovery may allow the aerobically fit to cope more effectively with emotional stress.	Keller, S;Seraganian, P	1984
6331698	Role of yoga in management of essential hypertension.	Twenty five patients of essential hypertension were studied. Of these, 20 patients were not given any antihypertensive drug treatment (Group A); other 5 had to be put on antihypertensive drugs before including them in the study (Group B). These patients were demonstrated "Shavasana" and trained to perform it correctly. Shavasana therapy was continued for six months. There was a statistically significant fall in both mean systolic and diastolic pressure of both groups. Further, there was a significant reduction in doses of antihypertensive drugs, being given to patients of group B. In 65% patients of group A, blood pressure could be controlled with Shavasana only and no drug was needed in them at all. Blood pressure rose significantly to pre-Shavasana levels in patients who left practising yoga. Thus, with use of yoga (Shavasana) in therapy of hypertension, requirement of antihypertensive drugs may be significantly decreased and in some cases may be totally dispensed with and it may be an useful adjunct in treatment of hypertension.

6662776	Effects of high-frequency breathing on pulmonary ventilation and gas exchange.	The effects of spontaneous high-frequency breathing (HFB) on lung function were evaluated in three subjects highly trained in the practice of yoga. Transpulmonary pressure was measured by an esophageal balloon catheter and gas flow by pneumotachography. The abdominal and rib cage contributions to tidal breathing were measured separately by respiratory inductive plethysmography. Gas exchange was studied by the conventional technique and by multiple inert gas elimination. During HFB, respiratory rate increased to 232 cycles/min with a tidal volume of 0.35 liter. This resulted in a more than 10-fold increase in expired minute ventilation to approximately 90 1/min. The transpulmonary pressure varied by 20 cmH2O, with the calculated elastic, resistive, and accelerative components varying by 2, 20, and 8 cmH2O, respectively. Respiratory work increased more than 200-fold in comparison with resting ventilation. A phase shift between thoracic and abdominal breathing was observed and was interpreted as a volume displacement of approximately 30 1/min between the two parts of the respiratory system. Arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide tension remained normal. Bohr dead space increased, while acetone dead space remained unaltered. A bimodal distribution of ventilation-perfusion ratios (VA/Q) was observed, with one mode in normal and another in "high" VA/Q regions.	Frostell, C;Pande, J N;Hedenstierna, G	1983 Dec
6229969	Description of an EEG pattern evoked in central--parietal areas by the Hathayogic exercise Agnisara.	Agnisara is a Hathayogic exercise consisting essentially in alternate, forceful retractions and protrusions of the abdominal wall, performed along a 20-30 s period of apnoea. In the course of series of Agnisars spindle bursts of a "wicket" EEG wave pattern developed over the para-Rolandic areas of the cerebral cortex, at frequencies around 12-13 Hz, with waxing and waning amplitudes in the range of 50 to 100 microV. These spindle-bursts, which occurred preferably during the phase of retraction of the abdominal wall, were named "Xi" rhythm (after the Greek letter X). It is the same as the one that regularly accompanies the performance on various other Hathayogic exercises. Xi spindles were recorded in linked earlobe reference derivations from areas located bilaterally midway between F-C, C-P, and P-O standard electrode positions of the 10-20 system. This EEG pattern would be considered as the expression of the central excitation, produced by the exercise's long-lasting and repeated stimulation of visceral, and somatic receptors. Thus, this activation affects mainly cortical structures with somato-visceral representation.	Roldan, E;Dostalek, C	1983 Dec

6358264	A comparison of two relaxation procedures for reducing cognitive and somatic anxiety.	The effectiveness of two different relaxation procedures was compared in treating snake anxious people who expressed anxiety primarily in a somatic or a cognitive manner. Forty moderately snake phobic subjects were categorized as either "somatically-anxious" or "cognitively-anxious" on the basis of a questionnaire. Half of the subjects in each group were given modified progressive relaxation training, and the other half received training in Agni-Yoga for four sessions. After completion of training, approach distance, subjective fear and pulse rates were measured during a snake approach test. In addition, a snake fear scale was given to each subject prior to and after approaching the snake. The results provided tentative evidence that the two relaxation procedures produced differential effects according to whether subjects expressed anxiety somatically or cognitively.

A ten-week yoga program was implemented with sixty-one white and forty-five low-income black elders at two community sites, along with a pretest-posttest control group research design with random assignment at each site. White elders attended class regularly, practiced yoga on their own on a daily basis, improved psychological well-being, and lowered their systolic blood pressure level, in comparison to a control group. Black elders, on the other hand, attended the once-a-week class regularly but did not practice on their own on a daily basis. Thus, they did not improve psychological well-being nor reduce blood pressure level in comparison to a control group. Social analysts suggest that low-income minority elders need more frequent contact with structured leadership in order to adhere to a daily routine that may lead to psychological and physical change. Other directions for controlled follow-up studies are suggested.	Haber, D	1983

Thirty-seven reports of the treatment of hypertension by non-pharmacological means were compared with the results of treatment by standard drug regimens. Treatment by drugs produced the greatest lowering of blood pressure. Treatment by weight reduction, yoga, and muscle relaxation each produced smaller, but appreciable, changes in blood pressure biofeedback, and salt restriction were inferior to those of the other regimens and were not significantly different to the effects of placebo treatment. Large comparative trials of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments are needed before definite conclusions can be made.	Andrews, G;MacMahon, S W;Austin, A;Byrne, D G	1982 May 22
7042457	An outpatient program in behavioral medicine for chronic pain patients based on the practice of mindfulness meditation: theoretical considerations and preliminary results.	The practice of mindfulness meditation was used in a 10-week Stress Reduction and Relaxation Program to train chronic pain patients in self-regulation. The meditation facilitates an attentional stance towards proprioception known as detached observation. This appears to cause an "uncoupling " of the sensory dimension of the pain experience from the affective/evaluative alarm reaction and reduce the experience of suffering via cognitive reappraisal. Data are presented on 51 chronic pain patients who had not improved with traditional medical care. The dominant pain categories were low back, neck and shoulder, and headache. Facial pain, angina pectoris, noncoronary chest pain, and GI pain were also represented. At 10 weeks, 65% of the patients showed a reduction of greater than or equal to 33% in the mean total Pain Rating Index (Melzack) and 50% showed a reduction of greater than or equal to 50%. Similar decreases were recorded on other pain indices and in the number of medical symptoms reported. Large and significant reductions in mood disturbance and psychiatric symptomatology accompanied these changes and were relatively stable on follow-up. These improvements were independent of the pain category. We conclude that this form of meditation can be used as the basis for an effective behavioral program in self-regulation for chronic pain patients. Key features of the program structure, and the limitations of the present uncontrolled study are discussed.	Kabat-Zinn, J	1982 Apr

7118825	Asthma: the yoga perspective. Part II: Yoga therapy in the treatment of asthma.	The integral yoga approach to asthma (and other psychosomatic disorders) is briefly outlined as meeting all of the requirements for an optimal, holistic, somatopsychic therapy (as outlined in Part I), including correction of distorted posture and faulty breathing habits, teaching a system of general muscle relaxation, techniques for the release of suppressed emotion and for reducing anxiety and self-conscious awareness, as well as special methods for the expectoration of mucus. Yoga practices are described in detail and the available psychophysiological research on yoga practice, as well as clinical-therapeutic studies on yoga as asthmatic therapy, are reviewed. It can therefore be concluded that yoga therapy is most effective with asthma.	Goyeche, J R;Abo, Y;Ikemi, Y	1982
7062302	A new model of integrating Occidental and Oriental approaches.	In the Western countries, dynamically oriented psychoanalysis, behaviour modification based on learning principles and existential, humanistic psychology have been widely used as treatment modalities for neuroses and psychosomatic disorders. Autogenic therapy for relaxation and self-control has been utilized. In the Orient, Yoga, Zen, Acupuncture and Fasting Therapy have been applied to various neuroses and psychosomatic conditions. These unique Oriental approaches, in general, induce an altered state of consciousness in the subjects, and the characterized by the heightening of self-normalization and the restoration of homeostasis. Morita therapy aims at accepting reality as it is and at promoting constructive ego function, and is effective for suitable cases. The above-mentioned Western approaches, which are rather psychosomatic, and the Oriental approaches, which are rather somatopsychic, are considered to be complementary within the framework of a holistic and integrative therapeutic model.

6798002	Pattern of breathing and ventilatory response to CO2 in subjects practicing hatha-yoga.	WE studied eight Belgian subjects well advanced in the practice of hatha-yoga and compared them with eight sex-, age-, and height-matched control subjects. Practice of yoga (range 4-12 yr) involves control of posture and manipulation of breathing, including slow near-vital capacity maneuvers accompanied by apnea at end inspiration and end expiration. Average values for the yoga and the control group (in parentheses) are as follows: ventilation (VE) 5.53 1 X min-1 (7.07); tidal volume (VT), 1.03 liters (0.56); rate of breathing, 5.5 min-1 (13.4); end-tidal PCO2, 39.0 Torr (35.3). All differences are significant (P less than 0.05). Ventilatory response to CO2 (rebreathing technique) was significantly lower in the yoga group (P less than 0.01). The regression relating VE to VT during rebreathing of CO2 was VE = 8.1 (VT - 0.23) for the yoga group and VE = 15.8 (VT - 0.16) for the control group (P less than 0.005). We attribute these changes to chronic manipulation of respiration.	Stanescu, D C;Nemery, B;Veriter, C;Marechal, C	1981 Dec

22556457	Some thoughts on neurophysiological basis of yoga.	Yoga presents the culmination of efforts made by mankind till now control mind and behaviour. It is living science, practiced in an elementary fashion by many in India. While a few perhaps are there who have attained mastery of this science.The background of the derivation and concept of yoga in India is presented followed by a simple exposition of yogic practices and some possible neurophysiologic explanations. Research in yoga will be rewarding as it gives means of exploring and enlarging the functions of the human brain.	Ramamurthi, B	1981 Jul

7008432	[Relation between yoga and psychotherapy].	Western psychotherapy and Yoga overlap insofar as both systems are based upon religious and mythological facts, and--on the level of psychotherapeutical praxis--on the technics of hypnosis, auto- and heterosuggestions and/or meditation. It is 50 years ago that the west considered the psychotherapeutical effects of theayoga-systems, first of all of Hatha- Yoga. Even today a theoretical foundation by means of proper comparison of the two structures is missing. In present-day India Yoga fulfills psychohygienical functions without being a psychotherapy in our sense. There are various techniques of magic in use, which replace the experimental psychological-psychotherapeutical methods in the West. The acceptance of meditation could only be successful if the metaphysical and sociocultural context would be integrated at the same time. The traditional function of Yoga guarantees its continuity even in the modern industrialized society of India. Neither the theoretical nor the pratical fundaments allow a direct transfer at present.

6990799	The consciousness disciplines and the behavioral sciences: questions of comparison and assessment.	In recent years a number of assessments of the non-Western consciousness disciplines have been undertaken by Western behavioral scientists. The author suggests that a variety of conceptual, methodological, experimential, and content inadequacies render the conclusions of these investigations of doubtful validity. He then describes the models of human nature postulated by these disciplines and the Western behavioral sciences, suggesting that comparing them results in a paradigm clash. The failure to recognize this clash seems to have resulted in inappropriate pathologizing interpretations. Attention is drawn to the relevance of recent findings in state-dependent learning, meditation studies, peak and transcendental experiences, transpersonal psychology, and quantum physics to an assessment of the consciousness disciplines, and suggestions for more adequate investigation are provided.

7251550	Asthma: The yoga perspective. Part I. The somatopsychic imbalance in asthma: towards a holistic therapy.	While the standard physiological and even certain psychological characteristics of asthmatic patients are well known, the current diagnostic and therapeutic approach to asthma remains inadequate, as it neglects certain interrelated somatopsychic factors vital to an optimal diagnostic-therapeutic programme. These include the role of skeletal muscle tension and posture, the role of the 'voluntary' respiratory musculature, especially the diaphragm, as well as anxiety, emotional suppression and excessive self-consciousness, all of which may be precipitants rather than the outcome of the onset of asthma. On the basis of these neglected factors and others, implications for an optimally effective therapy are discussed. The physical medicine or physiotherapeutic, as well as other recent therapeutic approaches, are reviewed and evaluated. It is concluded that all of these therapies are too "specific," and that a more holistic approach is necessary (which is provided in 'Asthma: The Yoga Perspective,' Part II-"Yoga Therapy in the Treatment of Asthma").

378862	Tension and relaxation in the individual.	Increasing materialism in society is resulting in more wide spread nervous tension in all age groups. While some degree of nervous tension is necessary in everyday living, its adverse effects require that we must learn to bring it under control. Total tension is shown to have two components: a controllable element arising from factors in the environment and the inbuilt uncontrollable residue which is basic in the individual temperament. The effects of excessive or uncontrolled stress can be classified as 1) emotional reactions such as neurotic behaviour (anxiety hypochondria, hysteria, phobia, depression obsessions and compulsions) or psychotic behaviour and 2) psychosomatic reactions (nervous asthma, headache, insomnia, heart attack). Nervous energy can be wastefully expended by such factors as loss of temper, wrong attitudes to work, job frustration and marital strains. Relaxation is the only positive way to control undesirable nervous tension and its techniques require to be learned. A number of techniques (progressive relaxation, differential relaxation, hypnosis, the use of biofeedback, Yoga and Transcendental Meditation) are described and their application to dental practice is discussed.

482559	Yoga as therapy in psychosomatic medicine.	Yoga as therapy with psychosomatic disorders has been practiced for many centuries in India, and only recently has become utilized for this purpose in other countries. The yoga system evolved as a 'system of liberation' to allow man to discriminate between his ego-self and pure consciousness, and as such, its medical benefits are really 'side-effects'. Integral yoga practice, however, with which many other self-regulatory somatopsychic approaches have much in common, consists of a holistic technology which functions to restore optimal homeostatis by a variety of special techniques not found in other approaches. Clinical observations of psychosomatic patients indicate that their distorted somatopsychic functioning necessitates their practice of yoga-like therapy. A review of the clinical evidence available indicates that yoga practice has proven most effective with a wide range of psychosomatic and psychiatric disorders. The effectiveness of yoga can be partially understood in terms of neurophysiological theory.	Goyeche, J R	1979

A matched group of 11 patients were given physiotherapy breathing exercises. Both groups of patients were followed up at monthly intervals for nine months with pulmonary function tests, tests of exercise tolerance, and inquiry into their symptoms. After training in yoga the mean maximum work increased significantly by 60.55 kpm; whereas no such rise occurred after training in physiotherapy. This objective improvement was associated with symptomatic improvement in a significantly higher number of patients given training in yoga.	Tandon, M K	1978 Aug

356079	Nonpharmacologic control of essential hypertension in man: a critical review of the experimental literature.	Many nonpharmacologic (behavioral) techniques are being proposed for the therapy of essential hypertension. The research in this area is reviewed and divided roughly into two categories: the biofeedback and relaxation methodologies. While feedback can be used to lower pressures during laboratory training sessions, studies designed to alter basal blood pressure levels with biofeedback have not yet been reported. The absence of evidence for such changes through biofeedback limits the usefulness of this technique in hypertension control. The various relaxation methods, such as yoga, transcendental meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, and others have shown more promise. With varying degrees of experimental vigor, many of these techniques have been associated with long-lasting changes in blood pressure. The strengths and weaknesses of the various authors' research designs, data and conclusions are discussed, and suggestions for further experimentation are offered.

365124	Psychophysiological correlates of the practice of Tantric Yoga meditation.	Autonomic and electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates of Tantric Yoga meditation were studied in three groups of subjects as they progressed from normal consciousness into meditation. Groups differed in their level of meditation proficiency. Measures of skin resistance, heart rate, respiration, autonomic orienting responses, resting EEG, EEG alpha and theta frequencies, sleep-scored EEG, averaged evoked responses, and subjective experience were employed. Unlike most previously reported meditation studies, proficient meditators demonstrated increased autonomic activation during meditation while unexperienced meditators demonstrated autonomic relaxation. During meditation, proficient meditators demonstrated increased alpha and theta power, minimal evidence of EEG-defined sleep, and decreased autonomic orienting to external stimulation. An episode of sudden autonomic activation was observed that was characterized by the meditator as an approach to the Yogic ecstatic state of intense concentration. These findings challenge the current "relaxation" model of meditative states.	Corby, J C;Roth, W T;Zarcone, V P Jr;Kopell, B S	1978 May

350747	Adrenocortical activity during meditation.	We studied acute plasma cortisol and testosterone concentration changes during the practice known as "transcendental meditation" (TM) and during control rest. Three groups of normal, young adult volunteers were studied: a group of controls, these same controls restudied as practitioners after 3 to 4 months of TM practice, and a group of long-term, regular TM practitioners (3 to 5 years of practice). No change was found in controls during rest. Cortisol declined, but not significantly, in restudied controls, while cortisol decreased significantly in long-term practitioners during meditation and remained somewhat low afterward. No change in testerone concentration was noted during either rest or TM. Apparently, the practice of TM becomes associated with psychophysiologic response(s) which acutely inhibit pituitary-adrenal activity.	Jevning, R;Wilson, A F;Davidson, J M	1978 Feb
25412	Arterial blood gases in Pranayama practice.	Pranayama is a Yogic breathing practice which is known experientially to produce a profound calming effect on the mind. In an experiment designed to determine whether the mental effects of this practice were accompanied by changes in the arterial blood gases, arterial blood was drawn from 10 trained individuals prior to and immediately after Pranayama practice. No significance changes in arterial blood gases were noted after Pranayama. A neural mechanism for the mental effects of this practice is proposed.	Pratap, V;Berrettini, W H;Smith, C	1978 Feb

As practices of altered states of consciousness (ASC) have become more widely used among psychotherapists who have become aware of the limitations of psychoanalytic, educational and behavioral approaches, negative aspects ('Makyo') of ASC have drawn their special attention. For the purpose of controlling or preventing these side-effects, (1) the problem of indication is most important, (2) and evaluation of the patient's personality is indispensable, (3) preparatory education about ASC methods and (4) guidance by experienced leaders are most helpful, (5) appropriate use of tranquilizers and (6) the mere presence of a supportive therapist at the place of practice can also be helpful.

577004	Biological significance of piezoelectricity in relation to acupuncture, Hatha Yoga, osteopathic medicine and action of air ions.	Piezoelectric properties of biological macromolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids and mucopolysaccharides are reviewed in this paper. It is indicated that the structural elements of the human body composed of these piezoelectric substances are capable of transducing a mechanical energy into an electric current. Such a transduction may be brought about by movements of an acupuncture needle, osteopathic manipulations; Hatha Yoga postures or action of negatively charged air irons. It is postulated that electric current induced by stimulation of the specific sites on the surface of human body flows towards the internal organs along the semiconductive channels of biologic macromolecules. Electric current induced either by the piezoelectric transduction or directly applied from an external source may in turn stimulate individual cells in the target organ. Involvement of electrical phenomena in regulatory mechanisms on cellular and molecular levels is discussed.	Lipinski, B	1977 Jan-Feb

The author reports two cases in which depersonalization occurred during the waking consciousness of individuals who had engaged in meditative techniques designed to alter consciousness. Psychiatrists should be aware of this phenomenon, as the number organizations in the "consciousness movement" is increasing, and should ask people manifesting depersonalization about any involvement in activities leading to altered states of consciousness. In some cases it might be appropriate to refer such patients to responsible groups that teach altered consciousness by meditation as an egosyntonic desirable state. The author cautions against the use of phenothiazines in cases where depersonalization is a prominent feature.	Kennedy, R B Jr	1976 Nov

The Japanese Zen and Indian Yoga meditation techniques of zazen, dharna, dhyan, savichar- and nirvichar-samadhi are cartographed on a perception-meditation continuum of increasing trophotropic arousal. Certain psychophysiological characteristics and experiential dimensions of these hypometabolic states are discussed and it is proposed that observer-observed interactions or trans-substantiation (commonly termed 'reality') may not be subject to Goedelian restrictions if they proceed in hyper- and hypoaroused states. The meaning of aroused, non-verbal and logically non-Aristotelean states cannot be conveyed to individuals in a non-aroused state. The converse is also true when the relationship of arousal levels is reversed.	Fischer, R	1976

The scientific research that has investigated the physiological changes associated with meditation as it is practiced by adherents of Indian Yoga, Transcendental Meditation, and Zen Buddhism has not yielded a thoroughly consistent, easily replicable pattern of responses. The majority of studies show meditation to be a wakeful state accompanied by a lowering of cortical and autonomic arousal. The investigations of Zen and Transcendental Meditation have thus far produced the most consistent findings. Additional research into the mechanisms underlying the phenomena of meditation will require a shifting from old to new methodological perspectives that allow for adequate experimental control and the testing of theoretically relevant hypotheses.

169670	[Recent medical research on yoga and states of concentration].	Traditional oriental thinking attracts the growing scientific interest of occidental practitioners. Dr. Pierre Etevenon, head of the Department of Neuro-Psycho-Pharmacology at the French Institute for Health and Medical Research (INSERM), held several conversations and scientific exchanges with the author, and kindly provided copies of some of his works. They are at the basis of the present paper. M. A. Descamps (Paris) found that asanas--yoga postures-- are generators of dynamic action when there is an extension of the spinal column, whilst they lead to quiet states when there is a flexion of it. Claeys and Gones (Belgium) proved that overall global relaxation, as well as differential relaxation were far more effective and deep when obtained by yogis than those attempted by University students majoring in Physical Education. Lonsdorfer and Nussbaum (France) studied several parameters concerning hatha-yoga and concluded that it provides a regular functioning of the main bodily functions fostering thus a psycho-physical balance. Wallace and Benson (U.S.A.) proved that transcendental meditation increases aerobic metabolism, counteracting anaerobic metabolism which is related to mental distress. Etevenon (Paris) investigated neurophysiological effects of yoga in connection to ancient Indian concepts (Upanishads) on sleeping, meditation and degree of consciousness. Dr. Etevenon has studied the phylogenetic evolution of waking-sleeping cycles, focusing on phylogenetic and ontongenetic appearances of REM cycles (activated sleep). A correlation has been made with EEG studies during states of concentration (yoga, transcendental meditation, Zen). These states have been found to be specific brain activities, and different from deep sleep, in spite of certain similarities in the EEG. Several hypothesis are set forth to explain brain activities underlying sites of concentration. The possibilities of developing a conscious mastering of dreams are also under research, and special attention is paid to the works of Saint Denys (1867), and hindu tradition. This paper discusses also the psychological, therapeutic and anthropological implications of recent discoveries in the field.	Lerner, M	1975 Mar

On involvement with the guru and a new 'family,' the experienced increased well-being and periods of bliss, and their acceptance of mystic Hindu beliefs was solidified. Factors relating to the devotees' psychological 'lift' are delineated, including ways that the bond to the leader possibly aided them in dealing with inner conflict. Earlier experiences with psychedelic drugs appeared to have influenced many of the subjects to Hinduism and the guru. It is postulated that a psychological characteristic of the devotees is a strong underlying wish for union with a powerful object,and that this bore on their susceptibility to the influence of certain regressive psychedelic experiences.

1114187	Sahaja: an Indian ideal of mental health.	Sahaja is an Indian ideal of mental and spiritual health that has received special emphasis in the Sikh scriptures--especially, the Adi Granth. Since the concept of sahaja has long been associated with mystical thought and practice, its description has become shrouded in peculiar esoteric terminologies. It is the purpose of this communication to divest sahaja of its esoteric, mystic connotations and to redefine it as a mental health ideal in the context of contemporary conditions.	Neki, J S	1975 Feb

46021	12-month follow-up of yoga and bio-feedback in the management of hypertension.	Twenty hypertensive patients treated by psychophysical relaxation exercises were followed up monthly for 12 months. Age and sex matched hypertensive controls were similarly followed up for 9 months. Statistically significant reductions in blood-pressure (BP) and antihypertensive drug requirements were satisfactorily maintained in the treatment group. Mere repetition of B.P. measurements and increased medical attention did not in themselves reduce B.P. significantly in control patients.	Patel, C	1975 Jan 11

A 6-month study with crossover at 3 months was designed to evaluate the possible beneficial effects of transcendental meditation upon bronchial asthma. 21 patients kept daily diaries of symptoms and medications and answered questionnaires at the end of the study and 6 months later. Other measurements included physician evaluation, pulmonary function testing, and galvanic skin resistance. The results indicated that transcendental meditation is a useful adjunct in treating asthma.	Wilson, A F;Honsberger, R;Chiu, J T;Novey, H S	1975

1096647	Psychotherapy in India: past, present, and future.	If psychotherapy is defined as "interpersonal method of mitigating suffering" then many psychotherapeutic systems have existed in India a long time. Unlike Western systems, these have lacked a clinical bias but have provided a more global framework. The future of psychotherapy in both East and West lies in discovering a conceptual framework with universal validity within which ad hoc therapies--for symptom relief, personality development, or interpersonal adjustment--can be developed.	Neki, J S	1975 Jan
801639	Religion and reality: the three doubts of Hillel.	The authors present an existential approach to the understanding of reality through an analysis of doubt. Doubt is understood as a healthy questioning of what others take for real, a search for that which will stand up to all criticism. Doubt begins in childhood, when one questions the authenticity of his parent's relationship to him. This doubt evokes anger, which normally leads to rebellion against or identification with the parents. Neither choice leads to personal authenticity or reality. Only the discovery of the true Self can heal this pain. There is a third choice possible, however, which takes account of another aspect of doubt, the one who doubts. When I doubt, I know that I don't know. Doubt then leads to the existential question, Who am I? This doubt is really faith, leading to Self-discovery. On the basis of this analysis, we re-open the old question of religion and reality. In predominantly religious cultures, the existential question, Who am I? has given rise to practical philosophies such as Yoga and Zen, together with their Western counterparts, the mysticisms associated with Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The same analysis of existential doubt as a path to the Self is to be found in Hillel's three questions.	Nicholis, W;Kent, I	1975

5416544	Physiological effects of transcendental meditation.	Oxygen consumption, heart rate, skin resistance, and electroenceph-alograph measurements were recorded before, during, and after subjects practiced a technique called transcendental meditation. There were significant changes between the control period and the meditation period in all measurements. During meditation, oxygen consumption and heart rate decreased, skin resistance increased, and the electroencephalogram showed specific changes in certain frequencies. These results seem to distinguish the state produced by transcendental meditation from commonly encountered states of consciousness and suggest that it may have practical applications.
