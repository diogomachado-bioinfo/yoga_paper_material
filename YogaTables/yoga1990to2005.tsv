25905290	Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention Options for Type 2 Diabetes: Complementary Health Approaches and Integrative Health (Including Natural Products and Mind/Body Practices)	Complementary health approaches, otherwise known as non-mainstream practices, are commonly used by patients with diabetes. Natural products, including dietary supplements, are the most frequently used complementary approach by patients with diabetes. While popular, there are regulatory, safety, and efficacy concerns regarding natural products. Commonly used dietary supplements for diabetes can be categorized as hypoglycemic agents, carbohydrate absorption inhibitors, and insulin sensitizers. Hypoglycemic agents of interest include banaba, bitter melon, fenugreek, and gymnema. American ginseng, banaba, berberine, chromium, cinnamon, gymnema, milk thistle, prickly pear cactus, soy, and vanadium are insulin sensitizers that have been studied in patients with diabetes. The carbohydrate absorption inhibitors aloe vera gel, fenugreek, flaxseed, prickly pear cactus, soy, and turmeric may be used in patients with diabetes. Mind body therapies including yoga, massage, and tai chi have preliminary evidence to support use in patients with diabetes. Deceptive marketing tactics may be employed by sellers of natural products. Consumers and clinicians must be aware of potential risks and make informed choices. Resources such as the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) MedWatch may be helpful. The FDA's online health fraud website informs consumers on various types of fraud and how to avoid them.

25009855		The growing consumer interest in health and fitness has expanded the market for a wide range of products, from yoga mats to the multiple dietary supplements now on the market. Supplements are popular, but are they safe? Many dietary supplements are probably safe when used as recommended. However, since 1994 when Congress decided that they should be regulated as if they were foods, they are assumed to be safe unless the Food and Drug Administration can demonstrate that they pose a significant risk to the consumer. But there are many types of products that qualify as dietary supplements, and the distinctions can become muddled and vague. Manufacturers are not legally required to provide specific information about safety before marketing their products. And the sales of supplements have been steadily increasing-all together, the various types now bring in almost $16 billion per year. Given these confounding factors, what kind of information can the Food and Drug Administration use to effectively regulate dietary supplements? This book provides a framework for evaluating dietary supplement safety and protecting the health of consumers.		2005
18311106	Randomized controlled trial of yogic meditation techniques for patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder.	The objective of this study was to compare efficacy of two meditation protocols for treating patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Patients were randomized to two groups-matched for sex, age, and medication status-and blinded to the comparison protocol. They were told the trial would last for 12 months, unless one protocol proved to be more efficacious. If so, groups would merge, and the group that received the less efficacious treatment would also be afforded 12 months of the more effective one. The study was conducted at Children's Hospital, San Diego, Calif. Patients were selected according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition-Revised (DSM-III-R) criteria and recruited by advertisements and referral. At baseline, Group 1 included 11 adults and 1 adolescent, and Group 2 included 10 adults. Group 1 employed a kundalini yoga meditation protocol and Group 2 employed the Relaxation Response plus Mindfulness Meditation technique. Baseline and 3-month interval testing was conducted using the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Symptoms Checklist-90-Revised Obsessive Compulsive (SCL-90-R OC) and Global Severity Index (SCL-90-R GSI) scales, Profile of Moods scale (POMS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and Purpose in Life (PIL) test. Seven adults in each group completed 3 months of therapy. At 3 months, Group 1 demonstrated greater improvements (Student's independent groups t-test) on the Y-BOCS, SCL-90-R OC and GSI scales, and POMS, and greater but nonsignificant improvements on the PSS and PIL test. An intent-to-treat analysis (Y-BOCS) for the baseline and 3-month tests showed that only Group 1 improved. Within-group statistics (Student's paired t-tests) showed that Group 1 significantly improved on all six scales, but Group 2 had no improvements. Groups were merged for an additional year using Group 1 techniques. At 15 months, the final group (N=11) improved 71%, 62%, 66%, 74%, 39%, and 23%, respectively, on the Y-BOCS, SCL-90-R OC, SCL-90-R GSI, POMS, PSS, and PIL; P<0.003 (analysis of variance). This study demonstrates that kundalini yoga techniques are effective in the treatment of OCD.	Shannahoff-Khalsa, D S;Ray, L E;Levine, S;Gallen, C C;Schwartz, B J;Sidorowich, J J	1999 Dec
17387075	Social workers' use of spiritual practices in palliative care.	Numerous studies have examined client use of spiritual and/or religious practices to cope with illness and adversity. This study explores social workers' use of spiritual practices as reflected in their work with palliative care clients. Survey results (n = 327) indicated significant relationships of spiritual practices such as yoga, prayer and meditation to working with palliative care clients. The total number of these approaches is predicted by factors such as theoretical orientation and the social workers' own struggles with palliative care and other issues. Our study supports the need for additional investigation of spiritual issues in practice.	Dane, Barbara;Moore, Robert	2005
17290110	Environmental factors and cervical artery dissection.	A history of a minor precipitating event is frequently elicited in patients with a spontaneous dissection of the carotid or vertebral artery. Other precipitating events associated with hyperextension or rotation of the neck include practicing yoga, painting a ceiling, coughing, vomiting, sneezing, the receipt of anesthesia, and the act of resuscitation. Chiropractic manipulation of the neck has been associated with carotid artery dissection and, particularly, vertebral artery dissection. Another risk factor for spontaneous dissections seems to be a recent history of a respiratory tract infection. The possibility of an infectious trigger is supported by the finding of a seasonal variation in the incidence of spontaneous dissections, with a peak incidence in fall. A potential link with common risk factors for vascular disease, such as tobacco use, hypertension, and the use of oral contraceptives, has not been systematically evaluated, but atherosclerosis appears to be distinctly uncommon in patients with a dissection of the carotid or vertebral arteries. In conclusion, although any hypotheses on the pathogenic mechanisms linking environmental factors and dissection remain speculative at present, we believe that these hypotheses may contribute to better define the spectrum of pathogenic conditions predisposing a cervical artery to dissection and provide arguments to better investigate the single or combined effect of such susceptibility factors in future studies.

17273248	The story of ferris urbanowski: california, here we come!	Although childbirth educators may not all have known her by name, the lovely redhead who was the star childbirth educator in the 1970s film The Story of Eric was a familiar face. After viewing the film numerous times in our classes, early childbirth educators all felt that we knew her. Ferris Urbanowski was an early crusader for the Lamaze method of childbirth preparation in California in the 1960s. She worked to convince physicians in the Los Angeles area of the merits of the method, to establish classes for expectant parents, and to start a chapter of ASPO (now, Lamaze International, Inc.) in Los Angeles. Her book about yoga illustrated how additional methods of relaxation could benefit pregnant women. Today, Urbanowski attributes her past involvement in childbirth education to her current professional role as a teacher and counselor in the field of stress reduction at the Stress Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center.

17021470	Backaches related to pregnancy: the risk factors, etiologies, treatments and controversial issues.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is no clear documentation in either the anesthetic/pain or obstetric literatures regarding the management of backache related to pregnancy. Backache can occur during pregnancy, in labor, and postpartum; different stages should be managed differently. The purpose of this review is to discuss the different types of backache, to provide an overview of diagnosis and treatment options, and to address several controversial issues related to pregnancy-related backaches. RECENT FINDINGS: Gestational backache is a substantial problem and can have a significant impact on a pregnant woman's daily activities. Non-pharmacological/complementary treatments such as posture adjustment, acupuncture, physical therapy, physiotherapy, yoga, and chiropractic may become the first line of treatment options. In labor backache the posture of the parturient can have an effect in decreasing the intensity of pain. Allopathic medicine, regional techniques (epidural), and complementary interventions are routinely given to parturients. However, there is a major perception of differences among midwives, obstetricians and anesthesiologists in terms of the risks and benefits of labor epidural analgesia. Postpartum backache is usually self-limited, but for some mothers the pain can last from a few months to several years. Early literature suggested that this problem was associated with the use of epidurals, but recent data in the literature deny such an association. SUMMARY: Overall, backache related to pregnancy is a significant problem. Education is still the first line of intervention for preventing backaches related to pregnancy. Both allopathic and complementary medicines are frequently used as treatments for backache related to pregnancy.	Wang, Shu-Ming	2003 Jun

16186024	The mental self.	In meditation both the quality and the contents of consciousness may be voluntarily changed, making it an obvious target in the quest for the neural correlate of consciousness. Here we present the results of a positron emission tomography study of yoga nidra relaxation meditation when compared with the normal resting conscious state. Meditation is accompanied by a relatively increased perfusion in the sensory imagery system: hippocampus and sensory and higher order association regions, with decreased perfusion in the executive system: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, striatum, thalamus, pons, and cerebellum. To identify regions active in both systems we performed a principal component analysis of the results. This separated the blood flow data into two groups of regions, explaining 25 and 18% of their variance: One group corresponded to the executive system, and the other to the systems supporting sensory imagery. A small group of regions contributed considerably to both networks: medial parietal and medial prefrontal cortices, together with the striatum. The inclusion of the striatum and our subsequent finding of increased striatal dopamine binding to D2 receptors during meditation suggested dopaminergic regulation of this circuit. We then investigated the neural networks supporting episodic retrieval of judgments of individuals with different degrees of self-relevance, in the decreasing order: self, best friend, and the Danish queen. We found that all conditions activated a medial prefrontal - precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum. This activation occurred together with the activation of the left lateral prefrontal/temporal cortex. The latter was dependent on the requirement of retrieval of semantic information, being most pronounced in the "queen" condition. Transcranial magnetic stimulation, targeting precuneus, was then applied to the medial parietal region to transiently disrupt the normal function of the circuitry. We found a decreased efficiency of retrieval of self-judgment compared to the judgment of best friend. This shows that the integrity of the function of precuneus is essential for self-reference, but not for reference to others.	Lou, Hans C;Nowak, Markus;Kjaer, Troels W	2005
16139187	Intracerebral pain processing in a Yoga Master who claims not to feel pain during meditation.	We recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) following noxious laser stimulation in a Yoga Master who claims not to feel pain when meditating. As for background MEG activity, the power of alpha frequency bands peaking at around 10 Hz was much increased during meditation over occipital, parietal and temporal regions, when compared with the non-meditative state, which might mean the subject was very relaxed, though he did not fall asleep, during meditation. Primary pain-related cortical activities recorded from primary (SI) and secondary somatosensory cortices (SII) by MEG were very weak or absent during meditation. As for fMRI recording, there were remarkable changes in levels of activity in the thalamus, SII-insula (mainly the insula) and cingulate cortex between meditation and non-meditation. Activities in all three regions were increased during non-meditation, similar to results in normal subjects. In contrast, activities in all three regions were weaker during meditation, and the level was lower than the baseline in the thalamus. Recent neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies have clarified that the emotional aspect of pain perception mainly involves the insula and cingulate cortex. Though we cannot clearly explain this unusual condition in the Yoga Master, a change of multiple regions relating to pain perception could be responsible, since pain is a complex sensory and emotional experience.

16008324	Efficacy of yoga in pregnant women with abnormal Doppler study of umbilical and uterine arteries.	To study the efficacy of yoga on the outcome of complicated pregnancy, 121 women attending antenatal clinic at Gunasheela Surgical and Maternity Hospital (GSMH) in Bangalore, India, were enrolled between 18-20 weeks of pregnancy in a prospective, matched, observational study. Sixty-eight women were in the yoga group and 53 women in the control group. Women were matched for age, gravida and Doppler velocimetry scores of umbilical and uterine arteries. Yoga practices including physical postures, breathing and meditation were practised by the yoga group, one hour daily, from the date of entry into the study until delivery. The control group walked half an hour twice a day during the study period. Compliance in both the groups was ensured. In babies the birth-weight is significantly higher (P < 0.018) in the Yoga group (2.78 +/- 0.52 kg), compared to the control group (2.55 +/- 0.52 kg). Occurrence of complications of pregnancy (pregnancy-induced hypertension, intrauterine growth retardation, pre-term delivery) shows lower trends in yoga group.

15977318	Old and new controversies in the alternative treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.	Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has become widespread in both referral and primary care populations. We review the purported mechanism of action and available evidence for selected CAM therapies for ADHD. Enduring controversies, such as elimination of artificial food additives, colors, and/or preservatives; the effect of sugar on behavior in children; and the use of EEG biofeedback, have been well studied but lack support as effective sole treatments for ADHD. The initial evidence for some emerging CAM therapies, such as essential fatty acid supplementation, yoga, massage, homeopathy, and green outdoor spaces, suggests potential benefits as part of an overall ADHD treatment plan. More rigorously designed studies are needed to evaluate their effectiveness as single therapy for ADHD.	Rojas, Neal L;Chan, Eugenia	2005
15940901	[Status of NIHS Computer Network System (NIHS-NET)].	We described the development of National Institute of Health Sciences Computer Network System (NIHS-NET), which was named NIHS Information and Computing Infrastructure (NICI) previously. In the system, the main server machines and common machines were replaced and the network lines were upgraded from 100 Mbps to 1Gbps. The connection nodes were changed from Inter Ministry Network (IMnet) to Science Information Network (SINET), and the dedicated lines between NIHS (yoga, osaka, tsukuba) and SINET were constructed. The Internet connection speed from each campus to SINET was upgraded. We also performed security audit in this system.	Segawa, Katsunori;Nakano, Tatsuya;Hayashi, Yuzuru;Nakata, Kotoko	2004
15907055	Modulation of cardiovascular response to exercise by yoga training.	This study reports the effects of yoga training on cardiovascular response to exercise and the time course of recovery after the exercise. Cardiovascular response to exercise was determined by Harvard step test using a platform of 45 cm height. The subjects were asked to step up and down the platform at a rate of 30/min for a total duration of 5 min or until fatigue, whichever was earlier. Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure response to exercise were measured in supine position before exercise and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10 minutes after the exercise. Rate-pressure product [RPP = (HR x SP)/100] and double product (Do P = HR x MP), which are indices of work done by the heart were also calculated. Exercise produced a significant increase in HR, systolic pressure, RPP & DoP and a significant decrease in diastolic pressure. After two months of yoga training, exercise-induced changes in these parameters were significantly reduced. It is concluded that after yoga training a given level of exercise leads to a milder cardiovascular response, suggesting better exercise tolerance.

15831140	Ayurveda and Yoga in Cardiovascular Diseases.	Ayurveda is derived from 2 Sanskrit words, namely, "Ayus" and "Veda," meaning life and knowledge, respectively. It literally means science of life. Ayurveda, of which yoga is an integral part, is widely practiced in India and is gaining acceptance in many countries around the world. It is a comprehensive and a holistic system, the focus of which is on the body, mind, and consciousness. The Ayurvedic treatment consists of the use herbal preparations, diet, yoga, meditation, and other practices. Based on the review of available studies, the evidence is not convincing that any Ayurvedic herbal treatment is effective in the treatment of heart disease or hypertension. However, the use of certain spices and herbs such as garlic and turmeric in an overall healthy diet is appropriate. Many herbs used by Ayurvedic practitioners show promise and could be appropriate for larger randomized trials. Yoga, an integral part of Ayurveda, has been shown to be useful to patients with heart disease and hypertension. Yoga reduces anxiety, promotes well-being, and improves quality of life. Its safety profile is excellent. Its use as a complementary therapeutic regimen under medical supervision is appropriate and could be worth considering.

15789782	[Physical exercise and yoga in prevention and treatment of addictive diseases].	Prevention of addictive diseases should be complex and systematic and it should include training of social skills, decision-making skills, family intervention, etc. Similarly, effective treatment is usually long-term, systematic and complex. Physical exercise and yoga can be useful components of comprehensive prevention and treatment programmes. On the other hand, competitive professional sport rather increases the number of risk factors for substance-related problems. Practical experience with the use of yoga in substance dependent patients and pathological gambles are mentioned. One of the advantages of yoga is the integration of physical exercise and relaxation.

15782445	Complementary and alternative medicine: personal preference or low cost option?	From acupuncture to yoga, Americans' use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is widespread and growing. The reasons that people give for using CAM are as diverse as the CAM therapies themselves: some perceive that conventional health care is ineffective, while others consider CAM to be more consistent with their own values and beliefs about health. As conventional health care costs rise, it is also possible that some people turn to CAM as a low cost alternative. This Issue Brief summarizes research that evaluates the relationship between CAM use and perceived access to conventional health care.	Pagan, Jose A;Pauly, Mark V	2004 Feb
15774384	Rehabilitation of the wandering seriously mentally ill (WSMI) women-The Banyan experience.	Started in 1993, in a small way, by a social worker as a response to the growing destitution of mentally ill women and with the objective of giving shelter, treatment and mainstreaming them, The Banyan has so far given 'Adaikalam' (refuge) to 413 women, of whom 252 have been rehabilitated. The entire care process starts from the time the women are picked from the streets in a disheveled and deranged state and brought to the home after much difficulty. On arrival they are spruced up and clinically assessed by a psychiatrist and put on medication. Slowly and steadily they return to the world of reality. Simultaneously, the inmates are put through various therapies like individual counseling, music, art, yoga, and vocational training. Finally, the address of the inmates is traced, and a team from The Banyan accompanies them, and they are rehabilitated. The family is enlightened about the illness, the woman's stay at The Banyan, need for continuous medication. The Banyan is a lifetime service provider of medicines, keeping track by regular follow up and above all a friend to whom they can seek any help at any time. The role played by the social workers is so vital that the success of the programme hinges on their repertoire of skill and commitment.	Rao, P Nalini	2004
15759599	An evaluation of the ability to voluntarily reduce the heart rate after a month of yoga practice.	The study aimed at determining whether novices to yoga would be able to reduce their heart rate voluntarily and whether the magnitude of reduction would be more after 30 days of yoga training. Two groups (yoga and control, n = 12 each) were assessed on Day 1 and on Day 30. During the intervening 30 days, the yoga group received training in yoga techniques while the control group carried on with their routine. At each assessment the baseline heart rate was recorded for one minute, this was followed by a six-minute period during which participants were asked to attempt to voluntarily reduce their heart rate, using any strategy. Both the baseline heart rate and the lowest heart rate achieved voluntarily during the six-minute period were significantly lower in the yoga group on Day 30 compared to Day 1 by a group average of 10.7 beats per minute (i.e., bpm) and 6.8 bpm, respectively (p < .05, Wilcoxon paired signed ranks test). In contrast, there was no significant change in either the baseline heart rate or the lowest heart rate achieved voluntarily in the control group on Day 30 compared to Day 1. The results suggest that yoga training can enable practitioners to use their own strategies to reduce the heart rate, which has possible therapeutic applications.

15712765	Trends in use of complementary and alternative medicine by US adults: 1997-2002.	CONTEXT: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use by US adults increased substantially between 1990 and 1997, yet little is known about more recent trends. OBJECTIVE: Compare CAM therapy use by US adults in 2002 and 1997. DESIGN: Comparison of two national surveys of CAM use by US adults: (1) the Alternative Health/Complementary and Alternative Medicine supplement to the 2002 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS, N = 31,044) and (2) a 1997 national survey (N = 2055), each containing questions about 15 common CAM therapies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence, sociodemographic correlates, and insurance coverage of CAM use. RESULTS: The most commonly used CAM modalities in 2002 were herbal therapy (18.6%, representing over 38 million US adults) followed by relaxation techniques (14.2%, representing 29 million US adults) and chiropractic (7.4%, representing 15 million US adults). Among CAM users, 41% used two or more CAM therapies during the prior year. Factors associated with highest rates of CAM use were ages 40-64, female gender, non-black/non-Hispanic race, and annual income of dollar 65,000 or higher. Overall CAM use for the 15 therapies common to both surveys was similar between 1997 and 2002 (36.5%, vs. 35.0%, respectively, each representing about 72 million US adults). The greatest relative increase in CAM use between 1997 and 2002 was seen for herbal medicine (12.1% vs.18.6%, respectively), and yoga (3.7% vs. 5.1%, respectively),while the largest relative decrease occurred for chiropractic (9.9% to 7.4%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CAM use has remained stable from 1997 to 2002. Over one in three respondents used CAM in the past year, representing about 72 million US adults.

15707256	Treatment of chronic insomnia with yoga: a preliminary study with sleep-wake diaries.	There is good evidence for cognitive and physiological arousal in chronic insomnia. Accordingly, clinical trial studies of insomnia treatments aimed at reducing arousal, including relaxation and meditation, have reported positive results. Yoga is a multicomponent practice that is also known to be effective in reducing arousal, although it has not been well evaluated as a treatment for insomnia. In this preliminary study, a simple daily yoga treatment was evaluated in a chronic insomnia population consisting of sleep-onset and/or sleep-maintenance insomnia and primary or secondary insomnia. Participants maintained sleep-wake diaries during a pretreatment 2-week baseline and a subsequent 8-week intervention, in which they practiced the treatment on their own following a single in-person training session with subsequent brief in-person and telephone follow-ups. Sleep efficiency (SE), total sleep time (TST), total wake time (TWT), sleep onset latency (SOL), wake time after sleep onset (WASO), number of awakenings, and sleep quality measures were derived from sleep-wake diary entries and were averaged in 2-week intervals. For 20 participants completing the protocol, statistically significant improvements were observed in SE, TST, TWT, SOL, and WASO at end-treatment as compared with pretreatment values.

15650471	A pilot study to examine the effects of a mindfulness-based stress-reduction and relaxation program on levels of stress hormones, physical functioning, and submaximal exercise responses.	OBJECTIVE: Stress has been cited as a causal factor in heart disease. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of an 8-week mindfulness-based stress-reduction program on the resting levels of stress hormones, physical functioning, and submaximal exercise responses in women with heart disease. SUBJECTS: Random selection with the numbers 1 and 2 were used to assign 18 women (60 +/-6.3 years old) with documented histories of heart disease to a treatment group (n = 9) or a control group (n = 9). Speilberger's state anxiety scores for the treatment (M = 37.88; standard deviation (SD) = 10.91) and control group (M = 43.22; SD = 12.26) were not significantly different prior to the start of the study. However, their scores fell in the upper percentile rank for normal adults in their age category. INTERVENTION: The intervention was provided one night each week for 2 hours over a period of 8 weeks. The intervention included didactic, inductive, and experiential modes of learning regarding stress responses and mindfulness skill-development training. DESIGN: Pre-post test hormonal measurements and physical function were analyzed using a 2 (group) by 2 (time) analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures following the 8-week program. Submaximal exercise responses were also compared between the treatment group and the control group following the 8-week program. A 2 (group) by 3 (time) ANOVA with repeated measures was used to analyze the data. SETTINGS/LOCATION: Weekly meetings were held on a university medical school campus. Submaximal exercise responses were recorded while participants cycled on a stationary bike in an applied physiology laboratory following the 8-week program. RESULTS: There were no significant main effects or interaction for the resting levels of stress hormones or physical functioning. There were no significant interactions for the submaximal exercise responses, however, there were significant main effects between groups for ventilation [F(2,32) = 7.65, p < .01, f = 0.8], and between group [F(1,16) = 8.84, p < .01, f = 0.8] and time [F(2,32) = 10.42, p < .01, f = 0.9], for breathing frequency. CONCLUSION: While the 8-week stress reduction program for women with heart disease did not show significant interactions between groups for resting levels of stress hormones, physical functioning, or submaximal exercise responses, there was a significant difference in breathing patterns between the 2 groups during exercise following the mindfulness-based stress-reduction program. There was also a trend for change in the intervention group in the resting levels of cortisol and physical function scores that was not seen in the control group. Future studies could use the effect size generated from this pilot study to calculate the number of subjects needed for adequate power to detect significant differences between groups.

15650464	Hemodynamic observations on a yogic breathing technique claimed to help eliminate and prevent heart attacks: a pilot study.	OBJECTIVE: This pilot study investigated the hemodynamics of a yogic breathing technique claimed "to help eliminate and prevent heart attacks due to abnormal electrical events to the heart," and to generally "enhance performance of the central nervous system (CNS) and to help eliminate the effects of traumatic shock and stress to the CNS." DESIGN: Parameters for (4) subjects were recorded during a preexercise resting period, a 31-minute exercise period, and a postexercise resting period. SETTINGS/LOCATION: Parameters for subjects were recorded in a laboratory at the University of California, San Diego. SUBJECTS: Parameters for 3 males (ages 44, 45, 67) and 1 female (age 41) were recorded. One (1) subject (male age 45) had extensive training in this technique. INTERVENTIONS: This yogic technique is a 1 breath per minute (BPM) respiratory exercise with slow inspiration for 20 seconds, breath retention for 20 seconds, and slow expiration for 20 seconds, for 31 consecutive minutes. OUTCOME MEASURES: Fourteen beat-to-beat parameters were measured noninvasively and calculated for body surface area to yield: stroke index (SI), heart rate (HR), cardiac index, end diastolic index, peak flow, ejection fraction, thoracic fluid index, index of contractility, ejection ratio, systolic time ratio, acceleration index, and systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures (MAPs). Left stroke work index (LSWI) and stroke systemic vascular resistance index (SSVRI) were calculated. RESULTS: We report on SI, HR, MAP, LSWI, and SSVRI and how they can help to describe hemodynamicstate changes. This technique induces dramatic shifts in all hemodynamic variables during the 1 BPM exercise and can produce unique changes in the postexercise resting period after long-term practice that appears to have a unique effect on the brain stem cardiorespiratory center regulating the Mayer wave (0.1-0.01 Hz) patterns of the cardiovascular system. CONCLUSIONS: Preclinical studies are warranted to examine the possible long-term effects of this technique that appear to reset a cardiorespiratory brain-stem pacemaker. We postulate that this effect may be the basis for the purported yogic health claim.	Shannahoff-Khalsa, David S;Sramek, B Bo;Kennel, Matthew B;Jamieson, Stuart W	2004 Oct
15648467	Relationship between achievement goal constructs and physical self-perceptions in a physical activity setting.	The relations of achievement goal theory constructs and physical self-perceptions were explored with 225 students (91 men, 109 women, and 25 nonindicators; M age=23.5 yr., SD=9.2), enrolled in basic physical activity classes (aerobics, weight training, modern dance, badminton, yoga, tai chi, basketball, racquetball, gymnastics, bowling, aquatone, and step aerobics) in a university setting. Goal orientations (Task and Ego Orientation in Sport Questionnaire), perceptions of the motivational climate (Perceived Motivational Climate in Sport Questionnaire-2), and physical self-perceptions (Physical Self-perception Profile) were assessed. Data were analyzed separately by sex. Ego orientation was the only predictor of Physical Self-perceptions in men, accounting for between 12 and 15% of the variance in Physical Self-worth, Sport Competence, Physical Conditioning, and Body Attractiveness.

15648409	Spatial and verbal memory test scores following yoga and fine arts camps for school children.	The performance scores of children (aged 11 to 16 years) in verbal and spatial memory tests were compared for two groups (n = 30, each), one attending a yoga camp and the other a fine arts camp. Both groups were assessed on the memory tasks initially and after ten days of their respective interventions. A control group (n = 30) was similarly studied to assess the test-retest effect. At the final assessment the yoga group showed a significant increase of 43% in spatial memory scores (Multivariate analysis, Tukey test), while the fine arts and control groups showed no change. The results suggest that yoga practice, including physical postures, yoga breathing, meditation and guided relaxation improved delayed recall of spatial information.

15648399	Yoga as a therapeutic intervention: a bibliometric analysis of published research studies.	Although yoga is historically a spiritual discipline, it has also been used clinically as a therapeutic intervention. A bibliometric analysis on the biomedical journal literature involving research on the clinical application of yoga has revealed an increase in publication frequency over the past 3 decades with a substantial and growing use of randomized controlled trials. Types of medical conditions have included psychopathological (e.g. depression, anxiety), cardiovascular (e.g. hypertension, heart disease), respiratory (e.g. asthma), diabetes and a variety of others. A majority of this research has been conducted by Indian investigators and published in Indian journals, particularly yoga specialty journals, although recent trends indicate increasing contributions from investigators in the U.S. and England. Yoga therapy is a relatively novel and emerging clinical discipline within the broad category of mind-body medicine, whose growth is consistent with the burgeoning popularity of yoga in the West and the increasing worldwide use of alternative medicine.

15636328	Beneficial effects of yoga lifestyle on reversibility of ischaemic heart disease: caring heart project of International Board of Yoga.	OBJECTIVES: Yoga based lifestyle modifications have been earlier shown to be beneficial in coronary artery disease in a small number of patients. We evaluated the role of lifestyle modification based on Yoga techniques, stress management and dietary modifications in retardation of coronary artery disease. METHODS: This prospective, controlled, open trial included angiographically proven coronary artery disease patients (71 patients in study group and 42 patients in control group). They were assessed clinically, by biochemical parameters, stress myocardial perfusion and function studies and coronary angiography and on psychological parameters. The study group patients were given a family based Yoga Programme which included, control of risk factors, dietary modifications and stress management for a period of one year. The patients were assessed at baseline, at frequent intervals and at the end of one year. RESULTS: At the end of one year of yoga training, statistical significant changes (P<0.05) were found in serum total cholesterol (reduction by 23.3% in study group patients as compared to 4.4% in controls); serum LDL cholesterol (reduction of 26% in study group patients as compared to 2.6% in the control group), regression of disease (43.7% of study group patients v/s 31% control group on MPI and 70.4% of study group v/s 28% of control group on angiography) arrest of progression (46.5% study group v/s 33.3% control group on MPI) and progression (9.9% of study group vs 35.7% of controls on MPI, 29.6% of study group v/s 60.0% of controls on angiography). At the end of the study improvement in anxiety scores was concordant with the improvement seen in the MPI. No untoward effects of the therapy were observed. CONCLUSION: Yoga based lifestyle modifications help in regression of coronary lesions and in improving myocardial perfusion. This is translated into clinical benefits and symptomatic improvement.

15636309	Role of yoga in modifying certain cardiovascular functions in type 2 diabetic patients.	OBJECTIVES: 1. To study the effect of forty days of Yogic exercises on cardiac functions in Type 2 Diabetics. 2. To study the effect of forty days of Yogic exercises on blood glucose level, glycosylated hemoglobin. METHODS: The present study done in twenty-four Type 2 DM cases provides metabolic and clinical evidence of improvement in glycaemic control and autonomic functions. These middle-aged subjects were type II diabetics on antihyperglycaemic and dietary regimen. Their baseline fasting and postprandial blood glucose and glycosylated Hb were monitored along with autonomic function studies. The expert gave these patients training in yoga asanas and they pursued those 30-40 min/day for 40 days under guidance. These asanas consisted of 13 well known postures, done in a sequence. After 40 days of yoga asanas regimen, the parameters were repeated. RESULTS: The results indicate that there was significant decrease in fasting blood glucose levels from basal 190.08 +/- 18.54 in mg/dl to 141.5 +/- 16.3 in mg/dl after yoga regimen. The post prandial blood glucose levels decreased from 276.54 +/- 20.62 in mg/dl to 201.75 +/- 21.24 in mg/dl, glycosylated hemoglobin showed a decrease from 9.03 +/- 0.29% to 7.83 +/- 0.53% after yoga regimen. The pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly (from 86.45 +/- 2.0 to 77.65 +/- 2.5 pulse/min, from 142.0 +/- 3.9 to 126.0 +/- 3.2 mm of Hg and from 86.7 +/- 2.5 mm of Hg to 75.5 +/- 2.1 mm of Hg after yoga regimen respectively). Corrected QT interval (QTc) decreased from 0.42 +/- 0.0 to 0.40 +/- 0.0. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that better glycaemic control and stable autonomic functions can be obtained in Type 2 DM cases with yoga asanas and pranayama. The exact mechanism as to how these postures and controlled breathing interact with somato-neuro-endocrine mechanism affecting metabolic and autonomic functions remains to be worked out.

15630819	Transformative practices for integrating mind-body-spirit.	This paper explores the clinical use of transformative practices that arose from the varied religious traditions of the world. Examples include prayer, meditation, mantra, affirmation, tai chi, and yoga. The purpose of these practices was to lead the practitioner to long term spiritual transformation toward an enhanced awareness of spirit, and a corresponding diminishment of identification with the mental and physical aspects of life. Unfortunately, the vagueness of the definition of transformation demonstrates that it is a broad and diffuse multidimensional concept difficult to quantify and resistant to rigorous research. However, these spiritual practices, offered as interventions separate from their spiritual tradition, have begun to be evaluated to document their effect on psychological and physical well-being. Currently, there are a number of well-designed studies that attest to the health-enhancing and suffering-reducing benefits derived from religiously transformative practices. There also is research, although sporadic and mostly on forgiveness, slowly emerging to show that prosocial positive emotion skills can be taught, and when measured, demonstrate benefit. Randomized trials of transformative practices are needed to help all levels of the health care system focus their attention on the manifestations and effect of the care delivered.

15624085	Right uninostril yoga breathing influences ipsilateral components of middle latency auditory evoked potentials.	A previous report described selective electrical activity of the cerebral hemispheres with uninostril breathing. In the present study, middle latency auditory evoked potentials (MLAEPs) were recorded from symmetrical scalp sites during the practice of uninostril yoga breathing. There were two sessions (40 min each) of right nostril yoga breathing (RNB) and of breath awareness (BAW), with (i) 'before', (ii) test (either RNB or BAW) and (iii) 'after' periods. The participants were 14 male volunteers aged between 18 and 33 years, and the setting was a yoga centre. MLAEPs were recorded from symmetrical scalp sites (C4 and C3). During RNB, the peak amplitudes of two negative components (viz. Na wave and Nb wave) were significantly increased on the right side. Increased peak amplitudes of Na and Nb waves suggested that RNB increased the number of neurons recruited on the right side, suggesting a possible application of RNB in certain psychiatric disorders with cerebral hemispheric imbalance.

15616408	Yoga in cardiac health (a review).	This review studies the efficacy of yoga in the primary and secondary prevention of ischaemic heart disease and post-myocardial infarction patient rehabilitation. Yoga is an unconventional form of physical exercise that has been practised over a long period of time in the Indian sub-continent. It has gained immense popularity as a form of recreational activity all over the world. Its possible contributions to healthy living have been studied and many interesting revelations have been made. Benefits of yoga in the modification of cardiovascular risk factors and in the rehabilitation of the post-myocardial infarction patient are areas of significant importance. It is important to assess the practical significance and the suitability of incorporating yoga into the comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation programme. Majority of the rehabilitation workers believes that incorporating nonconventional forms of physical exercise such as yoga definitely would enhance efficacy and add value. This article attempts to study the history and the science of yoga and evaluate its effects on cardiovascular health.	Jayasinghe, Satyajit R	2004 Oct
15616123	Site-specific glycosylation analysis of human apolipoprotein B100 using LC/ESI MS/MS.	Human apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100) has 19 potential N-glycosylation sites, and 16 asparagine residues were reported to be occupied by high-mannose type, hybrid type, and monoantennary and biantennary complex type oligosaccharides. In the present study, a site-specific glycosylation analysis of apoB100 was carried out using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI MS/MS). ApoB100 was reduced, carboxymethylated, and then digested by trypsin or chymotrypsin. The complex mixture of peptides and glycopeptides was subjected to LC/ESI MS/MS, where product ion spectra of the molecular ions were acquired data-dependently. The glycopeptide ions were extracted and confirmed by the presence of carbohydrate-specific fragment ions, such as m/z 204 (HexNAc) and 366 (HexHexNAc), in the product ion spectra. The peptide moiety of glycopeptide was determined by the presence of the b- and y-series ions derived from its amino acid sequence in the product ion spectrum, and the oligosaccharide moiety was deduced from the calculated molecular mass of the oligosaccharide. The heterogeneity of carbohydrate structures at 17 glycosylation sites was determined using this methodology. Our data showed that Asn2212, not previously identified as a site of glycosylation, could be glycosylated. It was also revealed that Asn158, 1341, 1350, 3309, and 3331 were occupied by high-mannose type oligosaccharides, and Asn 956, 1496, 2212, 2752, 2955, 3074, 3197, 3438, 3868, 4210, and 4404 were predominantly occupied by mono- or disialylated oligosaccharides. Asn3384, the nearest N-glycosylation site to the LDL-receptor binding site (amino acids 3359-3369), was occupied by a variety of oligosaccharides, including high-mannose, hybrid, and complex types. These results are useful for understanding the structure of LDL particles and oligosaccharide function in LDL-receptor ligand binding.

15603200	Clinical efficacy, mechanisms of action, and adverse effects of complementary and alternative medicine therapies for asthma.	Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) therapies such as herbal therapy, acupuncture, yoga, homeopathy, chiropractic medicine, and massage therapy, continue to gain popularity as modalities for the treatment of asthma. In the Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indian, and Western cultures, herbal therapies appear to be commonly used for allergies. Although well-controlled scientific studies have not been performed on many of the Asian herbal therapies and some basic studies have been performed on various herbal components (active ingredients), more needs to be done to assess the composite effects of many herbal remedies. An important part of the assessment of CAM modalities is the therapeutic-toxicologic safety profile (risk-benefit ratio), and further research evaluating the clinical efficacy and mechanism of action of various CAM interventions for asthma is greatly needed. This paper focuses on clinical and laboratory research regarding various CAM therapies that have been used in the treatment of asthma. The references cited are confined to literature originally published or translated into English.	Bielory, Leonard;Russin, Jonathan;Zuckerman, Gary B	2004 Sep-Oct

15574074	The effects of yoga training and a single bout of yoga on delayed onset muscle soreness in the lower extremity.	The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of yoga training and a single bout of yoga on the intensity of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). 24 yoga-trained (YT; n = 12) and non-yoga-trained (CON; n = 12), matched women volunteers were administered a DOMS-inducing bench-stepping exercise. Muscle soreness was assessed at baseline, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours after bench-stepping using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Groups were also compared on body awareness (BA), flexibility using the sit-and-reach test (SR), and perceived exertion (RPE). Statistical significance was accepted at p </= 0.05. A 2 x 2 mixed factorial ANOVA with repeated measures at 24 and 48 hours revealed a significant (p < 0.05) group main effect with VAS scores greater for CON than YT. Paired t-tests revealed that in YT, VAS scores were higher before yoga class than after yoga class at 24 hours (21.4 [+/- 6.9] mm vs. 11.1 [+/- 4.1] mm; p = 0.02). The SR was greater in YT than in CON (65.0 [+/- 7.9] cm vs. 33.3 [+/- 7.0] cm; p < 0.01); however, no differences were found between yoga and control in BA (94.0 [+/- 4.4] units vs. 83.8 [+/- 3.7] units; p = 0.21) or in RPE at 5-minute intervals (2.9 [+/- 0.3], 5.3 [+/- 0.8], 5.8 [+/- 0.9], and 5.2 [+/- 0.8] vs. 2.5 [+/- 0.3], 4.0 [+/- 0.5], 4.2 [+/- 0.3], and 4.9 [+/- 0.4]. Yoga training and a single bout of yoga appear to attenuate peak muscle soreness in women following a bout of eccentric exercise. These findings have significant implications for coaches, athletes, and the exercising public who may want to implement yoga training as a preseason regimen or supplemental activity to lessen the symptoms associated with muscle soreness.

15552705	Conservative interventions for carpal tunnel syndrome.	The assessment and conservative interventions in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) are described in this paper. Information about surgical procedures and postoperative care has also been included. It is difficult to make definitive conclusions about the literature regarding success of treatment for CTS due to variations in outcome measures, severity of CTS, and inconsistencies in duration, dosage, and follow-up time for interventions. Based on what is known to date, this author recommends that patients with mild or moderate CTS be provided with a conservative program of splinting the wrist in neutral for nocturnal wear. In addition, intermittent exercise (nerve-gliding exercises) and activity modification, including avoidance of protracted periods of sustained gripping activities and awkward wrist positions, can be useful. This conservative program may be complemented by pain-relieving modalities during times of activity and supplemental participation in other exercise such as yoga. If symptoms are not relieved to the satisfaction of the patient, or they recur, then it is incumbent upon the therapist to refer the patient to a hand surgeon for injection or possible surgical decompression.

15545076	Force and acceleration corridors from lateral head impact.	This study was conducted to provide force and acceleration corridors at different velocities describing the dynamic biomechanics of the lateral region of the human head. Temporo-parietal impact tests were conducted using specimens from ten unembalmed post-mortem human subjects. The specimens were isolated at the occipital condyle level, and pre-test x-ray and computed tomography images were obtained. They were prepared with multiple triaxial accelerometers and subjected to increasing velocities (up to 7.7 m/s) using free-fall techniques by impacting onto a force plate from which forces were recorded. A 40-durometer padding (50-mm thickness) material covering the force plate served as the impacting boundary condition. Computed tomography images obtained following the final impact test were used to identify pathology. Four specimens sustained skull fractures. Peak force, displacement, acceleration, energy, and head injury criterion variables were used to describe the dynamic biomechanics. Force and acceleration responses obtained from this experimental study along with other data will be of value in validating finite element models. The study underscored the need to enhance the sample size to derive probability-based human tolerance to side impacts.	Yoganandan, Narayan;Zhang, Jiangyue;Pintar, Frank	2004 Dec
15531830	Pulmonary function tests in Indian girls--prediction equations.	OBJECTIVE: The present study was conducted to evaluate pulmonary functions and develop prediction equations in Indian girls. METHODS: 1038 normal healthy schoolgirls in the age group of 5 to 15 years were selected for the present study. The anthropometrical parameters like height, weight, sitting height and chest circumference were measured and body surface area (BSA) and fat free mass (FFM) were derived using equations. The pulmonary functions such as FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC% and PEFR were studied. RESULTS: The height, sitting height, weight, BSA, chest circumference, body fat as well as FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC% and PEFR were comparable with Indian standards. Multiple regression equations were developed to predict FEV1, FVC and PEFR using anthropometrical indices like height, fat free mass and age or chest circumference in view of significantly high correlation of these parameters with lung function variables [height and FEV1 (r-0.90), height and FVC (r-0.899), height and PEFR (r-0.891), chest and FEV1 (r-0.868), chest and FVC (r-0.867), chest and PEFR (r-0.83)]. CONCLUSION: The regression equations to predict the pulmonary functions were presented using the independent variables like height, fat free mass and chest circumference or age, since these variables have shown very strong predictability for FEV1, FVC and PEFR. The equations presented in this study can be considered as referral standards for Indian girls.	Raju, P Sitarama;Prasad, K V V;Ramana, Y Venkata;Murthy, K J R	2004 Oct
15521565	Respiratory functions in Kalaripayattu practitioners.	Kalaripayattu, an ancient traditional martial art form of Kerala, is considered as the basis for all martial arts viz. Karate, Kungfu, etc. physiological studies are more concentrated on Karate, Kungfu and other martial arts due to their global acceptance. Considering the limited knowledge available regarding the physiological profiles of Kalaripayattu practitioners, the present study was taken up for filling the lacunae in the field. Lung function tests were carried out in ten Kalari practitioners. Residual volume was measured by indirect method. Higher lung volumes and flow rates were achieved in Kalari practitioners compared to age and height-matched controls. Better mechanical factors and lower airway resistance influenced during Kalari practice might have benefited in improving hung volumes and flow rates.

15521557	Energy cost and cardiorespiratory changes during the practice of Surya Namaskar.	Surya Namaskar (SN), a group of Yogic exercise consists of a set of twelve postures which is practiced by some of the yoga practitioners. The present study was undertaken to observe critically the energy cost and different cardiorespiratory changes during the practice of SN. Twenty-one male volunteers from the Indian Army practiced selected Yogic exercises for six days in a week for three months duration. The Yogic practice schedule consisted of Hatha Yogic Asanas (28 min), Pranayama (10.5 min) and Meditation (5 min). In the Yogic practice schedule 1st they practiced Kapal Bhathi (breathing maneuvers) for 2 min then Yogamudra (yogic postural exercise) for 2 min, after that they took rest until oxygen consumption and heart rate (HR) came to resting value. Subsequently subjects performed SN for 3 min 40 seconds on an average. After three months of training at the beginning of the fourth month subjects performed entire Yogic practice schedule in the laboratory as they practiced during their training session and experiments were carried out. Their pulmonary ventilation, carbondioxide output, Oxygen consumption, HR and other cardiorespiratory parameters were measured during the actual practice of SN. Oxygen consumption was highest in the eighth posture (1.22+/-0.073 1 min(-1)) and lowest in the first posture (0.35+/-0.02 1 min(-1)). Total energy cost throughout the practice of SN was 13.91 kcal and at an average of 3.79 kcal/min. During its practice highest HR was 101+/-13.5 b.p.m. As an aerobic exercise SN seemed to be ideal as it involves both static stretching and slow dynamic component of exercise with optimal stress on the cardiorespiratory system.

15487477	The effects of yoga on the attention and behavior of boys with Attention-Deficit/ hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).	Boys diagnosed with ADHD by specialist pediatricians and stabilized on medication were randomly assigned to a 20-session yoga group (n = 11) or a control group (cooperative activities; n = 8). Boys were assessed pre- and post-intervention on the Conners' Parent and Teacher Rating Scales-Revised: Long (CPRS-R:L & CTRS-R:L; Conners, 1997), the Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA; Greenberg, Cormna, & Kindschi, 1997), and the Motion Logger Actigraph. Data were analyzed using one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Significant improvements from pre-test to post-test were found for the yoga, but not for the control group on five subscales of the Conners' Parents Rating Scales (CPRS): Oppositional, Global Index Emotional Lability, Global Index Total, Global Index Restless/Impulsive and ADHD Index. Significant improvements from pre-test to post-test were found for the control group, but not the yoga group on three CPRS subscales: Hyperactivity, Anxious/Shy, and Social Problems. Both groups improved significantly on CPRS Perfectionism, DSM-IV Hyperactive/ Impulsive, and DSM-IV Total. For the yoga group, positive change from pre- to post-test on the Conners' Teacher Rating Scales (CTRS) was associated with the number of sessions attended on the DSM-IV Hyperactive-Impulsive subscale and with a trend on DSM-IV Inattentive subscale. Those in the yoga group who engaged in more home practice showed a significant improvement on TOVA Response Time Variability with a trend on the ADHD score, and greater improvements on the CTRS Global Emotional Lability subscale. Results from the Motion Logger Actigraph were inconclusive. Although these data do not provide strong support for the use of yoga for ADHD, partly because the study was under-powered, they do suggest that yoga may have merit as a complementary treatment for boys with ADHD already stabilized on medication, particularly for its evening effect when medication effects are absent. Yoga remains an investigational treatment, but this study supports further research into its possible uses for this population. These findings need to be replicated on larger groups with a more intensive supervised practice program.	Jensen, Pauline S;Kenny, Dianna T	2004 May
15481653	Effect of reflexology on EEG--a nonlinear approach.	Reflexology is a 4000-year-old art of healing practiced in ancient India, China and Egypt. In the beginning of the 20th century, it spread to the Western world. Reflexologic clinics and massage centers can be found all around the world. In spite of the widespread popularity, to the best of our knowledge, no serious research work has been done in this area, although much scientific research work has been carried out in other Eastern techniques like meditation and yoga. This is why a humble attempt is done in this work to quantitatively assess the effect of reflexological stimulation from a systems point of view. In this work, nonlinear techniques have been used to assess the complexity of EEG with and without reflexological stimulation. We prefer the nonlinear approach, as we believe that the effects are taking place in a subtle way, since there is no direct correlation between reflexological points and modern neuroanatomy.

15456626	Use of alternative medicines by allergic patients in Turkey.	BACKGROUND: Although complementary and alternative medicines are frequently used in Turkey, no studies with large series have yet been published. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to determine the prevalences of the use of various types of complementary and alternative medicines in patients with asthma, seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) and chronic urticaria (CU) and the relationship between the use of these substances and patients' social, economic and demographic characteristics. METHODS: All patients completed a questionnaire about the use of complementary and alternative medicines, including herbal products, animal products, acupuncture, yoga, massage therapies, Turkish-baths, speleotherapy, and psychoreligious methods for curing their diseases. RESULTS: The overall use of complementary and alternative medicines was 38 %. The most common alternative therapy treatment was herbal therapy (30.5 %). The prevalence of the use of these therapies was higher in asthmatics than in patients with SAR and CU. In all patients, variables associated with the use of these therapies were older age and having asthma. Among asthmatics, the use of these therapies within the previous 12 months was higher in patients with hospitalization and acute attacks than in those without hospitalization or acute attacks. In this group important covariates in the use of complementary and alternative medicines were older age and severe disease. Approximately half of the patients and 41.2 % of asthmatics discontinued pharmacological therapy during alternative treatment or had not yet started it. CONCLUSION: Because of the high prevalence of the use of complementary and alternative medicines and the tendency to discontinue drug therapy during these treatments, patients should be educated about the importance of pharmacological therapies.

15454358	Effects of Hatha yoga and African dance on perceived stress, affect, and salivary cortisol.	BACKGROUND: Dance and yoga have been shown to produce improvements in psychological well-being. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine some of the psychological and neuroendocrine response to these activities. METHODS: Sixty-nine healthy college students participated in one of three 90-min classes: African dance (n = 21), Hatha yoga (n= 18), or a biology lecture as a control session (n = 30). Before and after each condition participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), completed the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Schedule, and provided a saliva sample for cortisol. RESULTS: There were significant reductions in PSS and negative affect (ps < .0001) and Time x Treatment interactions (ps < .0001) such that African dance and Hatha yoga showed significant declines, whereas there was no significant change in biology lecture. There was no significant main effect for positive affect (p = .53), however there was a significant interaction effect (p < .001) such that positive affect increased in African dance, decreased in biology lecture, and did not change significantly in Hatha yoga. There was a significant main effect for salivary cortisol (p < .05) and a significant interaction effect (p < .0001) such that cortisol increased in African dance, decreased in Hatha yoga, and did not change in biology. Changes in cortisol were not significantly related to changes in psychological variables across treatments. There was 1 significant interaction effect (p = .04) such that change in positive affect and change in cortisol were negatively correlated in Hatha yoga but positively correlated in Africa dance and biology. CONCLUSIONS: Both African dance and Hatha yoga reduced perceived stress and negative affect. Cortisol increased in African dance and decreased in Hatha yoga. Therefore, even when these interventions produce similar positive psychological effects, the effects may be very different on physiological stress processes. One factor that may have particular salience is that amount of physiological arousal produced by the intervention.	West, Jeremy;Otte, Christian;Geher, Kathleen;Johnson, Joe;Mohr, David C	2004 Oct

15352751	Role of yoga in stress management.	The state of the mind and that of the body are intimately related. If the mind is relaxed, the muscles in the body will also be relaxed. Stress produces a state of physical and mental tension. Yoga, developed thousands of years ago, is recognized as a form of mind-body medicine. In yoga, physical postures and breathing exercises improve muscle strength, flexibility, blood circulation and oxygen uptake as well as hormone function. In addition, the relaxation induced by meditation helps to stabilize the autonomic nervous system with a tendency towards parasympathetic dominance. Physiological benefits which follow, help yoga practitioners become more resilient to stressful conditions and reduce a variety of important risk factors for various diseases, especially cardio-respiratory diseases.

15351070	An expression of within-plate uncertainty in sandwich ELISA.	This paper puts forward a method to describe an equation of the within-plate uncertainty (relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of measurements) as a function of analyte concentration in sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A kit for thyroid stimulating hormone is taken as an example. The pipetting procedures of analyte solution and chromogen-substrate solution and absorbance inherent to the wells of a microplate are identified as major error sources and their variability is included as parameters in the uncertainty equation. These parameters can be determined by the experiments with distilled water. The theoretical R.S.D. is shown to be in good agreement with the results of the repeated experiments using the real samples. Since the theory gives a continuous plot of R.S.D. against concentration, the uncertainty structure of the ELISA kit can be recognized over a wide concentration range and the detection limit and quantitation range can easily be determined on the plot.

28718739	Stretching exercises for qualitative researchers Stretching exercises for qualitative researchers Janesick Valerie J Sage 0761928154 0761928154 [Formula: see text].	The title of this text relates to the metaphor of art - specifically, dance and yoga. This is significant because it is a metaphor which is used throughout to emphasise the artistry of qualitative research. The author argues that qualitative researchers need to develop and refine observational, interview and journal techniques much as a dancer or yoga practitioner has to 'train the mind, eye and soul together'.		2004 Sep 1
15326755	Integrated approach to yoga.	Yoga is a science of Holistic living and not merely a set of Asanas and Pranayama. It is a psycho physical and spiritual science, which aims at the harmonious development of the human body, mind and soul. Yoga is the conscious art of self-discovery. It is a process by which animal man ascends through the stages from normal man to super man and then the divine man. It is an expansion of the narrow constricted egoistic personality to an all-pervasive eternal and blissful state of reality. Yoga is an all round development of personality at physical, mental intellectual, emotional and spiritual level.	Bhobe, S	2000 Feb

15295915	Mindfulness meditation: a path of transformation & healing.	As nurses, we have the unique privilege of witnessing and nurturing the healing process of the whole person--mind, body, and spirit. Teaching mindfulness meditation is a nursing intervention that can foster healing. The consistent practice of mindfulness meditation has been shown to decrease the subjective experience of pain and stress in a variety of research settings. Formal and informal daily practice fosters development of a profound inner calmness and nonreactivity of the mind, allowing individuals to face, and even embrace, all aspects of daily life, regardless of circumstances. By emphasizing being, not doing, mindfulness meditation provides a way through suffering for patients, families, and staff. This practice allows individuals to become compassionate witnesses to their own experiences, to avoid making premature decisions, and to be open to new possibilities, transformation, and healing.

15270370	Modulation of stress induced by isometric handgrip test in hypertensive patients following yogic relaxation training.	13 essential hypertensive patients aged 41 to 60 years were given yoga training for 60 min daily, Monday through Saturday, for a total duration of 4 weeks. Blood pressure and heart rate (HR) were measured with non-invasive semi-automatic blood pressure monitor. Measurements were recorded before the training and at weekly intervals during the 4 week training period. Results of our study show a significant (P<0.001) reduction in resting HR and rate-pressure-product (RPP) after 2 weeks of yoga training. Systolic pressure (SP), diastolic pressure (DP) (P<0.001) and mean pressure (MP) (P<0.05) showed a significant reduction at 3 weeks of training period. After 4 weeks of training, there was further fall in SP, DP, pulse pressure (PP) (P<0.05), MP (P<0.001), HR and RPP. Isometric handgrip test before yoga training produced a significant rise in SP and MP and insignificant rise in DP, HR and RPP. After yoga training, there was a significant rise in all these parameters. Our results show that yoga training optimises the sympathetic response to stressful stimuli like isometric handgrip test and restores the autonomic regulatory reflex mechanisms in hypertensive patients.

15266949	Effect of yoga training on handgrip, respiratory pressures and pulmonary function.	Although there are a number of reports on the effect of yoga training on pulmonary functions, very few studies have been undertaken on the effect of yoga training on respiratory pressures and handgrip endurance. Hence the present work was planned to study the effect of yoga training on hand grip strength (HGS), hand grip endurance (HGE), maximum expiratory pressure (MEP), maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), forced expiratory volume (FEV), forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). 20 school children in the age group of 12 to 15 years were given yoga training (asans and pranayams) for 6 months. 20 age and gender-matched students formed the control group. Yoga training produced statistically significant (P < 0.05) increase in HGS and HGE. MEP, MIP, FEV, FEV1 and PEFR also increased significantly (P < 0.001) after the yoga training. In contrast, the increase in these parameters in the control group was statistically insignificant. Our study shows that yoga training for 6 months improves lung function, strength of inspiratory and expiratory muscles as well as skeletal muscle strength and endurance. It is suggested that yoga be introduced at school level in order to improve physiological functions, overall health and performance of students.

15255625	Effect of yoga on cardiovascular system in subjects above 40 years.	This study was conducted to examine the effect of yoga on cardiovascular function in subjects above 40 yrs of age. Pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and Valsalva ratio were studied in 50 control subjects (not doing any type of physical exercise) and 50 study subjects who had been practicing yoga for 5 years. From the study it was observed that significant reduction in the pulse rate occurs in subjects practicing yoga (P<0.001). The difference in the mean values of systolic and diastolic blood pressure between study group and control group was also statistically significant (P<0.01 and P<0.001 respectively). The systolic and diastolic blood pressure showed significant positive correlation with age in the study group (r1 systolic= 0.631 and r1 diastolic = 0.610) as well as in the control group (r2 systolic = 0.981 and r2 diastolic = 0.864). The significance of difference between correlation coefficient of both the groups was also tested with the use of Z transformation and the difference was significant (Z systolic= 4.041 and Z diastolic= 2.901). Valsalva ratio was also found to be significantly higher in yoga practitioners than in controls (P<0.001). Our results indicate that yoga reduces the age related deterioration in cardiovascular functions.

15209590	Prospective study of new participants in a community-based mind-body training program.	BACKGROUND: Mind-body practices such as yoga are widely popular, but little is known about how such exercises impact health-related quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To measure changes in health-related quality of life associated with 3 months of mind-body training as practiced in community-based settings. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Eight centers for practice of mind-body training. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred ninety-four English-speaking adults who had taken no more than 10 classes at the centers prior to enrollment in the study. One hundred seventy-one (88%) returned the 3-month follow-up questionnaire. INTERVENTION: Administration of the SF-36 questionnaire at the start of training and after 3 months. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At baseline, new participants in mind-body training reported lower scores than U.S. norms for 7 of 8 domains of the SF-36: mental health, role emotional, social, vitality, general health, body pain, and role physical (P <.002 for all comparisons). After 3 months of training, within-patient change scores improved in all domains (P <.0001), including a change of +15.5 (standard deviation +/-21) in the mental health domain. In hierarchical regression analysis, younger age (P=.0003), baseline level of depressive symptoms (P=.01), and reporting a history of hypertension (P=.0054) were independent predictors of greater improvement in the SF-36 mental health score. Five participants (2.9%) reported a musculoskeletal injury. CONCLUSIONS: New participants in a community-based mind-body training program reported poor health-related quality of life at baseline and moderate improvements after 3 months of practice. Randomized trials are needed to determine whether benefits may be generalizable to physician-referred populations.	Lee, Sung W;Mancuso, Carol A;Charlson, Mary E	2004 Jul
15209206	What can family physicians offer patients with carpal tunnel syndrome other than surgery? A systematic review of nonsurgical management.	BACKGROUND: We undertook a literature review to produce evidence-based recommendations for nonsurgical family physician management of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). METHODS: Study design was systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on CTS treatment. Data sources were English publications from all relevant databases, hand searches, and guidelines. Outcomes measured were nonsurgical management options for CTS. RESULTS: We assessed 2 systematic reviews, 16 RCTs, and 1 before-and-after study using historical controls. A considerable percentage of CTS resolves spontaneously. There is strong evidence that local corticosteroid injections, and to a lesser extent oral corticosteroids, give short-term relief for CTS sufferers. There is limited evidence to indicate that splinting, laser-acupuncture, yoga, and therapeutic ultrasound may be effective in the short to medium term (up to 6 months). The evidence for nerve and tendon gliding exercises is even more tentative. The evidence does not support the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, diuretics, pyridoxine (vitamin B6), chiropractic treatment, or magnet treatment. CONCLUSIONS: For those who are not able to get surgery or for those who do not want surgery, there are some conservative modalities that can be tried. These modalities include ones for which there is good evidence. It would be reasonable to try some of the techniques with less evidence if the better ones are not successful. Reconsideration of surgery must always be kept in mind to avoid permanent nerve damage.	Goodyear-Smith, Felicity;Arroll, Bruce	2004 May-Jun

15188733	Complementary and alternative medicine use among adults: United States, 2002.	OBJECTIVE: This report presents selected estimates of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among U.S. adults, using data from the 2002 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). METHODS: Data for the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population were collected using computer-assisted personal interviews (CAPI). This report is based on 31,044 interviews of adults age 18 years and over. Statistics shown in this report were age adjusted to the year 2000 U.S. standard population. RESULTS: Sixty-two percent of adults used some form of CAM therapy during the past 12 months when the definition of CAM therapy included prayer specifically for health reasons. When prayer specifically for health reasons was excluded from the definition, 36% of adults used some form of CAM therapy during the past 12 months. The 10 most commonly used CAM therapies during the past 12 months were use of prayer specifically for one's own health (43.0%), prayer by others for one's own health (24.4%), natural products (18.9%), deep breathing exercises (11.6%), participation in prayer group for one's own health (9.6%), meditation (7.6%), chiropractic care (7.5%), yoga (5.1%), massage (5.0%), and diet-based therapies (3.5%). Use of CAM varies by sex, race, geographic region, health insurance status, use of cigarettes or alcohol, and hospitalization. CAM was most often used to treat back pain or back problems, head or chest colds, neck pain or neck problems, joint pain or stiffness, and anxiety or depression. Adults age 18 years or over who used CAM were more likely to do so because they believed that CAM combined with conventional medical treatments would help (54.9%) and/or they thought it would be interesting to try (50.1%). Most adults who have ever used CAM have used it within the past 12 months, although there is variation by CAM therapy.	Barnes, Patricia M;Powell-Griner, Eve;McFann, Kim;Nahin, Richard L	2004 May 27
15184614	Randomized controlled trial of yoga and exercise in multiple sclerosis.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of yoga and of aerobic exercise on cognitive function, fatigue, mood, and quality of life in multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: Subjects with clinically definite MS and Expanded Disability Status Score less than or equal to 6.0 were randomly assigned to one of three groups lasting 6 months: weekly Iyengar yoga class along with home practice, weekly exercise class using a stationary bicycle along with home exercise, or a waiting-list control group. Outcome assessments performed at baseline and at the end of the 6-month period included a battery of cognitive measures focused on attention, physiologic measures of alertness, Profile of Mood States, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Multi-Dimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI), and Short Form (SF)-36 health-related quality of life. RESULTS: Sixty-nine subjects were recruited and randomized. Twelve subjects did not finish the 6-month intervention. There were no adverse events related to the intervention. There were no effects from either of the active interventions on either of the primary outcome measures of attention or alertness. Both active interventions produced improvement in secondary measures of fatigue compared to the control group: Energy and Fatigue (Vitality) on the SF-36 and general fatigue on the MFI. There were no clear changes in mood related to yoga or exercise. CONCLUSION: Subjects with MS participating in either a 6-month yoga class or exercise class showed significant improvement in measures of fatigue compared to a waiting-list control group. There was no relative improvement of cognitive function in either of the intervention groups.

15165407	Effects of Hatha yoga and Omkar meditation on cardiorespiratory performance, psychologic profile, and melatonin secretion.	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate effects of Hatha yoga and Omkar meditation on cardiorespiratory performance, psychologic profile, and melatonin secretion. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty healthy men in the age group of 25-35 years volunteered for the study. They were randomly divided in two groups of 15 each. Group 1 subjects served as controls and performed body flexibility exercises for 40 minutes and slow running for 20 minutes during morning hours and played games for 60 minutes during evening hours daily for 3 months. Group 2 subjects practiced selected yogic asanas (postures) for 45 minutes and pranayama for 15 minutes during the morning, whereas during the evening hours these subjects performed preparatory yogic postures for 15 minutes, pranayama for 15 minutes, and meditation for 30 minutes daily, for 3 months. Orthostatic tolerance, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, dynamic lung function (such as forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, forced expiratory volume percentage, peak expiratory flow rate, and maximum voluntary ventilation), and psychologic profile were measured before and after 3 months of yogic practices. Serial blood samples were drawn at various time intervals to study effects of these yogic practices and Omkar meditation on melatonin levels. RESULTS: Yogic practices for 3 months resulted in an improvement in cardiorespiratory performance and psychologic profile. The plasma melatonin also showed an increase after three months of yogic practices. The systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, and orthostatic tolerance did not show any significant correlation with plasma melatonin. However, the maximum night time melatonin levels in yoga group showed a significant correlation (r = 0.71, p < 0.05) with well-being score. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that yogic practices can be used as psychophysiologic stimuli to increase endogenous secretion of melatonin, which, in turn, might be responsible for improved sense of well-being.

15162107	Effectiveness of hand therapy interventions in primary management of carpal tunnel syndrome: a systematic review.	The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of hand therapy interventions for carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) based on the best available evidence. A qualitative systematic review was conducted. A literature search using 40 key terms was conducted from the earliest available date to January 2003 using seven databases. Articles were randomly assigned to two of five reviewers and evaluated according to predetermined criteria for inclusion at each of the title, abstract, and article levels. Included studies were independently scored by two reviewers using a structured effectiveness quality evaluation scale and also graded according to Sackett's Levels of Evidence. There were 2027 articles identified from the literature search, of which 345 met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-four studies were used to formulate 30 recommendations. Current evidence demonstrates a significant benefit (grade B recommendations) from splinting, ultrasound, nerve gliding exercises, carpal bone mobilization, magnetic therapy, and yoga for people with CTS.

15154162	Changes in middle latency auditory evoked potentials during meditation.	In the present study of middle latency auditory evoked potentials during Brahmakumaris Raja Yoga meditation there was a decrease in the peak latency of the Na wave (a negative wave between 14 and 19 msec.) during meditation. Since the neural generator of this wave lies at the midbrain-thalamic level, from the results one can infer that the meditation reduces conduction time at this level.

15141399	A pilot study of a yoga and meditation intervention for dementia caregiver stress.	Twelve older female dementia patient family caregivers (eight Latinas and four Caucasians) participated in a six-session manualized yoga-meditation program (called Inner Resources) designed to help caregivers cope with stress. Pre/post comparisons revealed statistically significant reductions in depression and anxiety and improvements in perceived self-efficacy. Average minutes of weekly yoga-meditation practice were significantly associated with improvements in depression. The majority of caregivers found the intervention useful and reported subjective improvements in physical and emotional functioning. These findings suggest that Inner Resources may be a feasible and effective intervention for family caregivers and may improve affect, coping, physical well-being, and stress management.

15139072	Psychological adjustment and sleep quality in a randomized trial of the effects of a Tibetan yoga intervention in patients with lymphoma.	BACKGROUND: Research suggests that stress-reduction programs tailored to the cancer setting help patients cope with the effects of treatment and improve their quality of life. Yoga, an ancient Eastern science, incorporates stress-reduction techniques that include regulated breathing, visual imagery, and meditation as well as various postures. The authors examined the effects of the Tibetan yoga (TY) practices of Tsa lung and Trul khor, which incorporate controlled breathing and visualization, mindfulness techniques, and low-impact postures in patients with lymphoma. METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with lymphoma who were undergoing treatment or who had concluded treatment within the past 12 months were assigned to a TY group or to a wait-list control group. Patients in the TY group participated in 7 weekly yoga sessions, and patients in the wait-list control group were free to participate in the TY program after the 3-month follow-up assessment. RESULTS: Eighty nine percent of TY participants completed at least 2-3 three yoga sessions, and 58% completed at least 5 sessions. Patients in the TY group reported significantly lower sleep disturbance scores during follow-up compared with patients in the wait-list control group (5.8 vs. 8.1; P < 0.004). This included better subjective sleep quality (P < 0.02), faster sleep latency (P < 0.01), longer sleep duration (P < 0.03), and less use of sleep medications (P < 0.02). There were no significant differences between groups in terms of intrusion or avoidance, state anxiety, depression, or fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: The participation rates suggested that a TY program is feasible for patients with cancer and that such a program significantly improves sleep-related outcomes. However, there were no significant differences between groups for the other outcomes.	Cohen, Lorenzo;Warneke, Carla;Fouladi, Rachel T;Rodriguez, M Alma;Chaoul-Reich, Alejandro	2004 May 15
15136413	Kapalabhati pranayama: breath of fire or cause of pneumothorax? A case report.	Spontaneous pneumothorax is the most common cause of pneumothorax. We report a case of a 29-year-old healthy woman who presented to the emergency department with a spontaneous pneumothorax caused by a yoga breathing technique called Kapalabhati pranayama, or breath of fire. Yoga breathing exercises are commonly practiced, and a limited number of studies have shown various physiologic benefits of yoga breathing. This is the only known report of spontaneous pneumothorax caused by pranayama, but some other rare causes are noted. This case should illustrate that adverse side effects can occur when one pushes the body to physiologic extremes.	Johnson, Derek B;Tierney, Mathew J;Sadighi, Parvis J	2004 May
15132194	Breaking through the despair: spiritually oriented group therapy as a means of healing women with severe mental illness.	Studies have shown that 96% of Americans believe in God and over 90% pray yet there is relatively little education available for clinicians on how to use spirituality as a tool for healing mental illness, particularly when treating very sick patients. This article illustrates how spiritually oriented group therapy with severely ill women can help to improve mood, affect, motivation, interpersonal bonding, and sense of self, and can succeed in reaching patients and promoting recovery in ways that traditional therapy cannot. Specific modalities including group prayer, yoga breathing, and spiritual readings are described. Breaking Through the Despair offers both a psychodynamic and a neurophysiologic perspective for understanding how this type of treatment helps patients transcend their mental illness and be able to grasp abstract spiritual concepts, develop a sense of belonging to a caring community, and integrate a new sense of themselves as productive and valued individuals.

15116977	Improvement in reliability of probabilistic test of significant differences in GeneChip experiments.	A probabilistic test (FUMI theory) for GeneChip experiments has been proposed for selecting the genes which show significant differences in the gene expression levels between a single pair of treatment and control. This paper describes that the reliability of the judgment by the FUMI theory can be enhanced, when the selected genes are referred to biomolecular-functional networks of a commercial database. The genes judged as being differently expressed are grouped into a cluster in the biomolecular networks. It is also demonstrated that false positive genes have a trend in the networks to be isolated from each other, and also away from the clustered genes, since the false positive genes are randomly selected.

15102213	Chronic persistent pain after severe burns: a survey of 358 burn survivors.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence, characteristics, and effects of chronic persistent pain on burn survivors. DESIGN: Mail survey. SETTING: Respondents' homes. PATIENTS: All members of the Phoenix Society for Burn Survivors. INTERVENTIONS: None. OUTCOME MEASURES: Twenty-three questions on the prevalence of pain and its characteristics, including the short form of the McGill-Melzack Pain Questionnaire. RESULTS: Of 1,500 members who received the survey, 358 (24%) responded. Respondents had burns covering an average of 59% of their bodies. Time between the injury and the survey averaged 12 years. On the survey, 52% of respondents reported ongoing burn-related pain, and 46% were able to characterize their pain with one or more of 15 characteristics. Two-thirds (66%) reported that pain interfered with their rehabilitation, and 55% reported that pain interfered with their daily lives. Asked "what makes the pain worse now?," the most frequent reply (15%) was "the weather" (including "hot" or "cold"). Various physical activities (e.g., walking, bicycling) were also mentioned, along with nerve regrowth, contractures, remembering the accident, and depression. "Things that make your pain better now" included "nothing," a variety of over-the-counter analgesics, "rest,""exercise,""yoga,""acupuncture,""family and friends," and "God." In coping with their pain, most respondents found family the most helpful, although nurse(s) received almost as high a rating. CONCLUSIONS: Pain associated with burn trauma continues to be of considerable significance in the lives of burn victims long after the initial injury and hospitalization. Little research has been done on this population.	Dauber, Andreas;Osgood, Patricia F;Breslau, Alan J;Vernon, Holly L;Carr, Daniel B	2002 Mar
15089864	Use of complementary therapies in pregnancy: the perceptions of obstetricians and midwives in South Australia.	OBJECTIVE: To examine South Australian obstetricians and midwives attitude's towards the use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) during pregnancy, to examine their referral patterns and their views on the usefulness and safety of these therapies during pregnancy. DESIGN: All members of the South Australian branch of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and a 50% sample of midwives belonging to the South Australian Branch of The Australian College of Midwives, were sent a postal self-completion questionnaire. RESULTS: A response rate of 78% was obtained. Only 14% of doctors considered CAM was a threat to public health. Over 90% of midwives and obstetricians thought they should have some knowledge about CAM. A greater proportion of obstetricians (72%) held a view there needs to be an evidence base for CAM compared with 26% of midwives. The majority of obstetricians (68%) and midwives (78%) had formally referred a patient for use of one of the complementary therapies. Over 70% of obstetricians and midwives considered massage, acupuncture, vitamins, yoga, meditation and hypnosis to be useful and safe to use during pregnancy. CONCLUSION: The majority of clinician's held positive views towards CAM and considered some complementary therapies to be useful and safe for use during pregnancy. Limited evidence exists on the safety and efficacy of these therapies and attention needs to be given to undertaking high quality randomised controlled trials.

15077462	Yogic versus conventional treatment in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome: a randomized control study.	This study was conducted to evaluate the comparative effect of yogic and conventional treatment in diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in a randomized control design. The patients were 22 males, aged 20-50 years, with confirmed diagnosis of diarrhea-predominant IBS. The conventional group (n = 12, 1 dropout) was given symptomatic treatment with loperamide 2-6 mg/day for 2 months, and the yogic intervention group (n = 9) consisted of a set of 12 asanas (yogic poses, i.e., Vajrasana, Shashankasana, Ushtrasana, Marjariasana, Padhastasana, Dhanurasana, Trikonasana in two variations, Pawanmuktasana, and Paschimottanasana) along with Surya Nadi pranayama (right-nostril breathing) two times a day for 2 months. All participants were tested at three regular intervals, at the start of study--0 month, 1 month, and 2 months of receiving the intervention--and were investigated for bowel symptoms, autonomic symptoms, autonomic reactivity (battery of five standard tests), surface electrogastrography, anxiety profile by Spielberger's Self Evaluation Questionnaire, which evaluated trait and state anxiety. Two months of both conventional and yogic intervention showed a significant decrease of bowel symptoms and state anxiety. This was accompanied by an increase in electrophysiologically recorded gastric activity in the conventional intervention group and enhanced parasympathetic reactivity, as measured by heart rate parameters, in yogic intervention group. The study indicates a beneficial effect of yogic intervention over conventional treatment in diarrhea-predominant IBS.

15055096	A yoga intervention for young adults with elevated symptoms of depression.	CONTEXT: Yoga teachers and students often report that yoga has an uplifting effect on their moods, but scientific research on yoga and depression is limited. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of a short-term Iyengar yoga course on mood in mildly depressed young adults. DESIGN: Young adults pre-screened for mild levels of depression were randomly assigned to a yoga course or wait-list control group. SETTING: College campus recreation center. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-eight volunteers ages 18 to 29. At intake, all participants were experiencing mild levels of depression, but had received no current psychiatric diagnoses or treatments. None had significant yoga experience. INTERVENTION: Subjects in the yoga group attended two 1-hour Iyengar yoga classes each week for 5 consecutive weeks. The classes emphasized yoga postures thought to alleviate depression, particularly back bends, standing poses, and inversions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Profile of Mood States, morning cortisol levels. RESULTS: Subjects who participated in the yoga course demonstrated significant decreases in self-reported symptoms of depression and trait anxiety. These effects emerged by the middle of the yoga course and were maintained by the end. Changes also were observed in acute mood, with subjects reporting decreased levels of negative mood and fatigue following yoga classes. Finally, there was a trend for higher morning cortisol levels in the yoga group by the end of the yoga course, compared to controls. These findings provide suggestive evidence of the utility of yoga asanas in improving mood and support the need for future studies with larger samples and more complex study designs to more fully evaluate the effects of yoga on mood disturbances.

15055095	The impact of modified Hatha yoga on chronic low back pain: a pilot study.	PURPOSE: The purpose of this randomized pilot study was to evaluate a possible design for a 6-week modified hatha yoga protocol to study the effects on participants with chronic low back pain. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-two participants (M = 4; F = 17), between the ages of 30 and 65, with chronic low back pain (CLBP) were randomized to either an immediate yoga based intervention, or to a control group with no treatment during the observation period but received later yoga training. METHODS: A specific CLBP yoga protocol designed and modified for this population by a certified yoga instructor was administered for one hour, twice a week for 6 weeks. Primary functional outcome measures included the forward reach (FR) and sit and reach (SR) tests. All participants completed Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) questionnaires. Guiding questions were used for qualitative data analysis to ascertain how yoga participants perceived the instructor, group dynamics, and the impact of yoga on their life. ANALYSIS: To account for drop outs, the data were divided into better or not categories, and analyzed using chi-square to examine differences between the groups. Qualitative data were analyzed through frequency of positive responses. RESULTS: Potentially important trends in the functional measurement scores showed improved balance and flexibility and decreased disability and depression for the yoga group but this pilot was not powered to reach statistical significance. Significant limitations included a high dropout rate in the control group and large baseline differences in the secondary measures. In addition, analysis of the qualitative data revealed the following frequency of responses (1) group intervention motivated the participants and (2) yoga fostered relaxation and new awareness/learning. CONCLUSION: A modified yoga-based intervention may benefit individuals with CLB, but a larger study is necessary to provide definitive evidence. Also, the impact on depression and disability could be considered as important outcomes for further study. Additional functional outcome measures should be explored. This pilot study supports the need for more research investigating the effect of yoga for this population.

15055093	Prevalence and patterns of adult yoga use in the United States: results of a national survey.	BACKGROUND: Although yoga appears to be popular in the United States, there are no published studies on yoga's prevalence or patterns of use. METHODS: In 1998 we surveyed by telephone a nationally representative sample of 2055 English-speaking U.S. adults (60% weighted response rate) regarding yoga use. RESULTS: Of the respondents, 7.5% used yoga at least once in their lifetime and 3.8% used yoga in the previous 12 months. Respondents who used yoga at least once were more likely than non-users to be female (68% vs. 51%), college educated (68% vs. 45%), and urban dwellers (93% vs. 74%). Factors independently associated with yoga use at least once included female gender (OR 2.5 [95% CI 1.7-3.8]), baby boomer age group (ages 34-53) compared to pre-baby boomers (> or = 54 (2.3 [1.4-4.0]), education beyond high school (2.2 [1.4-3.5]), residing in large and small metropolitan areas compared to non-metropolitan areas (3.8 [1.8-7.8] and 2.7 [1.3-5.8], respectively), and use of other CAM therapies (5.3 [2.7-10.5]). Of respondents using yoga in the previous 12 months, 64% reported using yoga for wellness, 48% for health conditions, and 21% specifically for back or neck pain. Ninety percent felt yoga was very or somewhat helpful and 76% did not report spending money related to their yoga. CONCLUSIONS: In 1998 an estimated 15.0 million American adults had used yoga at least once in their lifetime and 7.4 million during the previous year. Yoga was used for both wellness and specific health conditions often with perceived helpfulness and without expenditure.

15026845	A nonlinear circuit architecture for magnetoencephalographic signal analysis.	OBJECTIVES: The objective of this paper was to face the complex spatio-temporal dynamics shown by Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data by applying a nonlinear distributed approach for the Blind Sources Separation. The effort was to characterize and differ-entiate the phases of a yogic respiratory exercise used in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorders. METHODS: The patient performed a precise respiratory protocol, at one breath per minute for 31 minutes, with 10 minutes resting phase before and after. The two steps of classical Independent Component Approach have been performed by using a Cellular Neural Network with two sets of templates. The choice of the couple of suitable templates has been carried out using genetic algorithm optimization techniques. RESULTS: Performing BSS with a nonlinear distributed approach, the outputs of the CNN have been compared to the ICA ones. In all the protocol phases, the main components founded with CNN have similar trends compared with that ones obtained with ICA. Moreover, using this distributed approach, a spatial location has been associated to each component. CONCLUSIONS: To underline the spatio-temporal and the nonlinearly of the neural process a distributed nonlinear architecture has been proposed. This strategy has been designed in order to overcome the hypothesis of linear combination among the sources signals, that is characteristic of the ICA approach, taking advantage of the spatial information.

15025884	An introduction to Kundalini yoga meditation techniques that are specific for the treatment of psychiatric disorders.	The ancient system of Kundalini yoga includes a vast array of meditation techniques and many were discovered to be specific for treating the psychiatric disorders as we know them today. One such technique was found to be specific for treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), the fourth most common psychiatric disorder, and the tenth most disabling disorder worldwide. Two published clinical trials are described here for treating OCD using a specific Kundalini yoga protocol. This OCD protocol also includes techniques that are useful for a wide range of anxiety disorders, as well as a technique specific for learning to manage fear, one for tranquilizing an angry mind, one for meeting mental challenges, and one for turning negative thoughts into positive thoughts. Part of that protocol is included here and published in detail elsewhere. In addition, a number of other disorder-specific meditation techniques are included here to help bring these tools to the attention of the medical and scientific community. These techniques are specific for phobias, addictive and substance abuse disorders, major depressive disorders, dyslexia, grief, insomnia and other sleep disorders.

15003337	Biomechanics of temporo-parietal skull fracture.	UNLABELLED: This paper presents an analysis of research on the biomechanics of head injury with an emphasis on the tolerance of the skull to lateral impacts. The anatomy of this region of the skull is briefly described from a biomechanical perspective. Human cadaver investigations using unembalmed and embalmed and intact and isolated specimens subjected to static and various types of dynamic loading (e.g., drop, impactor) are described. Fracture tolerances in the form of biomechanical variables such as peak force, peak acceleration, and head injury criteria are used in the presentation. Lateral impact data are compared, where possible, with other regions of the cranial vault (e.g., frontal and occipital bones) to provide a perspective on relative variations between different anatomic regions of the human skull. The importance of using appropriate instrumentation to derive injury metrics is underscored to guide future experiments. RELEVANCE: A unique advantage of human cadaver tests is the ability to obtain fundamental data for delineating the biomechanics of the structure and establishing tolerance limits. Force-deflection curves and acceleration time histories are used to derive secondary variables such as head injury criteria. These parameters have direct application in safety engineering, for example, in designing vehicular interiors for occupant protection. Differences in regional biomechanical tolerances of the human head have implications in clinical and biomechanical applications.	Yoganandan, Narayan;Pintar, Frank A	2004 Mar
14992675	A yoga-based exercise program for people with chronic poststroke hemiparesis.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This was a preliminary investigation of the effects of a yoga-based exercise program on people with chronic (greater than 9 months) poststroke hemiparesis. Many people who have had a stroke report an impaired health status because of a reduced level of activity. Proponents of yoga contend that it offers a gentle alternative exercise program that can be easily adapted for people who have had a stroke. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Four subjects with chronic poststroke hemiparesis participated in this single-case study. The primary outcome measures were the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and the Timed Movement Battery (TMB). A secondary outcome measure was the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS). The baseline testing phase varied for each subject and ranged from 4 to 7 weeks. The 8-week intervention phase consisted of 1.5-hour yoga sessions, 2 times per week, in the subject's home. The primary outcome data were collected each week, and the secondary outcome data were collected before the baseline testing phase and before and after the intervention phase. RESULTS: Subjects 1, 2, and 4 had improved TMB scores, and subjects 3 and 4 had improved BBS scores. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The results suggest that yoga may be beneficial to people who have had a stroke. Further investigation is warranted to further examine the effects of yoga in this population.	Bastille, Julie V;Gill-Body, Kathleen M	2004 Jan
14991388	Cancer supportive care, improving the quality of life for cancer patients. A program evaluation report.	GOALS OF WORK: As medical care for cancer has become more specialized in diagnosis, treatment has become more technical and fragmented. In order to help cancer patients and their families, we developed a coordinated program called the Stanford Cancer Supportive Care Program (SCSCP) at the Center for Integrative Medicine at Stanford Hospital and Clinics. The Stanford Cancer Supportive Care Program was initiated in 1999 to provide support for cancer patients, addressing the need for improved physical and emotional well-being and quality of life. This paper is a program evaluation report. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The number of patient visits grew from 421 in 1999 to 6319 in 2002. This paper describes the utilization of the SCSCP program as assessed by 398 patient visit evaluations during a 9-week period, January 2002 to March 2002. During this time we collected attendance records with demographic data and anonymous questionnaires evaluating each program. Patients were asked to evaluate how the program helped them regarding increase of energy, reduction in stress, restful sleep, pain reduction, sense of hopefulness, and empowerment. MAIN RESULTS: Over 90% of the patients using the SCSCP felt there was benefit to the program. Programs were chosen based on a needs assessment by oncologists, nurse managers, social workers, and patients. Massage, yoga, and qigong classes had the highest number of participants. Qualitative data showed benefit for each program offered. CONCLUSIONS: This evaluation of a free cancer supportive care program initiated in a hospital outpatient setting provides initial evidence of patient satisfaction and improvement in quality of life.

14987084	Precision, limit of detection and range of quantitation in competitive ELISA.	This paper develops a mathematical model for describing the within-plate variation as the RSD (relative standard deviation) of absorbance measurements in a wide concentration range in competitive ELISA and proposes a method for determining the limit of detection (LOD) and range of quantitation (ROQ). The ELISA for 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone is taken as an example. The theoretical RSD description involves analyte concentration as an independent variable and error sources as parameters which concern the pipetting and absorbance measurement. Our model can dispense with repeated experiments of real samples, but the error parameters should be determined experimentally. The theory is in good agreement with the experiments. The most influential error sources at low and high sample concentrations are shown to be the pipetting of a viscous solution of antiserum and the absorbance inherent to the wells of a plate, respectively. The LOD and ROQ are defined as the concentration with 30% RSD and the region with <10% RSD, respectively, and are found in the theoretical plot of the RSD of concentration estimates vs concentration.

14982609	Randomized trial of yoga as a complementary therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis.	OBJECTIVE: The present prospective, randomized trial compared the efficacy of anti-tuberculosis treatment (ATT) with two separate programs (yoga and breath awareness), on lung capacities and bacteriological status in pulmonary tuberculosis patients. METHODOLOGY: A total of 1009 pulmonary tuberculosis patients were screened and 73 were alternately allocated, to yoga (n = 36) or breath awareness (n = 37) groups, with 48 patients completing the 2-month trial. Patients aged between 20 and 55 years, who were sputum-positive on three consecutive examinations, had no prior ATT, and no comorbidities or extrapulmonary tuberculosis were included. In addition to ATT, one group practised yoga (n = 25) and the other practised breath awareness (n = 23) for 6 h per week, each session being 60 min. The main outcome measures were: symptom scores, bodyweight, FVC, FEV(1), FEV(1)/FVC%, sputum microscopy, sputum culture, and postero-anterior view of the CXR. RESULTS: At the end of 2 months, the yoga group showed a significant reduction in symptom scores (88.1%), and an increase in weight (10.9%), FVC (64.7%) and FEV(1) (83.6%) (P = 0.001, in all comparisons, paired t-test). The breath awareness group also showed a significant (paired t-test) reduction in symptom scores (16.3%, P= 0.02), and an increase in weight (2.1%, P= 0.003) and FEV(1) (63.8%, P= 0.04). Significantly more patients in the yoga group showed sputum conversion based on microscopy on days 30 and 45 compared to the breath awareness group (P = 0.045 and P= 0.002, respectively, chi(2) test). Ten of 13 in the yoga group had negative sputum culture after 60 days compared with four of 19 in the breath awareness group (P = 0.005, chi(2) test). Improvement in the radiographic picture occurred in 16/25 in the yoga group compared to 3/22 in the breath awareness group on day 60 (P = 0.001, chi(2) test). CONCLUSIONS: The improved level of infection, radiographic picture, FVC, weight gain and reduced symptoms in the yoga group suggest a complementary role for yoga in the management of pulmonary tuberculosis.

14766027	Emerging role of integrative medicine in cardiovascular disease.	Our evolution toward a more integrative approach toward healing will accelerate if we can alter the different perspectives that patients and physicians bring to their relationship. This article reviews lessons that have been acquired using alternative approaches to facilitate the recovery of patients undergoing invasive procedures. After identifying that most of our patients use alternative therapies but prefer not to discuss these therapies with their surgeons, we began to routinely refer our patients to a coordinator trained in this field. The resulting integrative medicine program offers massage, yoga, audiotapes, and additional customized treatments. The coexisting research laboratory designs and conducts well-organized research endeavors evaluating the efficacy of therapies being offered. By mixing clinical practice with conventional research, we seek to emulate the successful formula used in allopathic medicine.	Oz, Mehmet	2004 Mar-Apr

14749092	Mindfulness-based stress reduction in relation to quality of life, mood, symptoms of stress and levels of cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and melatonin in breast and prostate cancer outpatients.	OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the relationships between a mindfulness-based stress reduction meditation program for early stage breast and prostate cancer patients and quality of life, mood states, stress symptoms, and levels of cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEAS) and melatonin. METHODS: Fifty-nine patients with breast cancer and 10 with prostate cancer enrolled in an eight-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program that incorporated relaxation, meditation, gentle yoga, and daily home practice. Demographic and health behavior variables, quality of life, mood, stress, and the hormone measures of salivary cortisol (assessed three times/day), plasma DHEAS, and salivary melatonin were assessed pre- and post-intervention. RESULTS: Fifty-eight and 42 patients were assessed pre- and post-intervention, respectively. Significant improvements were seen in overall quality of life, symptoms of stress, and sleep quality, but these improvements were not significantly correlated with the degree of program attendance or minutes of home practice. No significant improvements were seen in mood disturbance. Improvements in quality of life were associated with decreases in afternoon cortisol levels, but not with morning or evening levels. Changes in stress symptoms or mood were not related to changes in hormone levels. Approximately 40% of the sample demonstrated abnormal cortisol secretion patterns both pre- and post-intervention, but within that group patterns shifted from "inverted-V-shaped" patterns towards more "V-shaped" patterns of secretion. No overall changes in DHEAS or melatonin were found, but nonsignificant shifts in DHEAS patterns were consistent with healthier profiles for both men and women. CONCLUSIONS: MBSR program enrollment was associated with enhanced quality of life and decreased stress symptoms in breast and prostate cancer patients, and resulted in possibly beneficial changes in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning. These pilot data represent a preliminary investigation of the relationships between MBSR program participation and hormone levels, highlighting the need for better-controlled studies in this area.

14748859	Use of mind-body medical therapies.	OBJECT: Research demonstrating connections between the mind and body has increased interest in the potential of mind-body therapies. Our aim was to examine the use of mind-body therapies, using data available from a national survey. DESIGN: Analysis of a large nationally representative dataset that comprehensively evaluated the use of mind-body therapies in the last year. SETTING: United States households. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2055 American adults in 1997-1998. INTERVENTIONS: Random national telephone survey. MEASURES AND MAIN RESULTS: We obtained a 60% weighted overall response rate among eligible respondents. We found that 18.9% of adults had used at least 1 mind-body therapy in the last year, with 20.5% of these therapies involving visits to a mind-body professional. Meditation, imagery, and yoga were the most commonly used techniques. Factors independently and positively associated with the use of mind-body therapies in the last year were being 40 to 49 years old (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33 to 3.10), being not married (AOR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.34 to 2.36), having an educational level of college or greater (AOR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.57 to 3.09), having used self-prayer for a medical concern (AOR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.87 to 3.42), and having used another complementary medicine therapy in the last year (AOR, 3.77; 95% CI, 2.74 to 5.20). While used for the full array of medical conditions, they were used infrequently for chronic pain (used by 20% of those with chronic pain) and insomnia (used by 13% of those with insomnia), conditions for which consensus panels have concluded that mind-body therapies are effective. They were also used by less than 20% of those with heart disease, headaches, back or neck pain, and cancer, conditions for which there is strong research support. Mind-body therapies were generally used concomitantly with conventional care: 90% of those using a mind-body therapy in the last year had seen a physician and 80% of mind-body therapies used were discussed with a physician. CONCLUSIONS: Although mind-body therapies were commonly used, much opportunity exists to increase use of mind-body therapies for indications with demonstrated efficacy.

14727499	Ayurveda for diabetes mellitus: a review of the biomedical literature.	Diabetes mellitus is a condition that is extremely serious from both clinical and public health standpoints. The traditional healthcare system of India, Ayurveda, offers a balanced and holistic multi-modality approach to treating this disorder. Many Ayurvedic modalities have been subjected to empirical scientific evaluation, but most such research has been done in India, receiving little attention in North America. This paper offers a review of the English language literature related to Ayurveda and diabetes care, encompassing herbs, diet, yoga, and meditation as modalities that are accessible and acceptable to Western clinicians and patients. There is a considerable amount of data from both animal and human trials suggesting efficacy of Ayurvedic interventions in managing diabetes. However, the reported human trials generally fall short of contemporary methodological standards. More research is needed in the area of Ayurvedic treatment of diabetes, assessing both whole practice and individual modalities.	Elder, Charles	2004 Jan-Feb
14724371	Short-term effects of an intensive lifestyle modification program on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant systems in patients with coronary artery disease.	The purpose of this study was to compare the short-term effects of an intensive lifestyle modification (ILM) program on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant systems in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Twenty-two patients in the control group continued to receive their conventional treatment with lipid-lowering drugs, whereas 22 patients in the experimental group were assigned to intensive lifestyle modification (ILM) without taking any lipid-lowering agent. The ILM program comprised dietary advice on low-fat diets, high antioxidants and high fiber intakes, yoga exercise, stress management and smoking cessation. After 4 months of intervention, patients in the experimental group revealed a statistically significant increase in plasma total antioxidants, plasma vitamin E and erythrocyte glutathione (GSH) compared to patients in the control group. There was no significant change in plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), a circulating product of lipid peroxidation, in either group. We concluded that the ILM program increased circulating antioxidants and reduced oxidative stress in patients with CAD.

14723315	Acute effect of Mukh bhastrika (a yogic bellows type breathing) on reaction time.	Reaction time (RT) is an index of the processing ability of central nervous system and a simple means of determining sensory-motor performance. It has been reported that yoga training improves human performance including central neural processing. Earlier studies from our laboratories have shown that yoga training produces a significant decrease in visual reaction time (VRT) and auditory reaction time (ART). The present work was planned to determine if mukh bhastrika (a yogic technique in which breath is actively blasted out in 'whooshes' following a deep inspiration) has any effect on central neural processing by studying its effect on RT. 22 healthy schoolboys who were practising yoga for the past three months were recruited for the present study. VRT and ART were recorded before and after nine rounds of mukh bhastrika. Mukh bhastrika produced a significant (P < 0.01) decrease in VRT as well as ART. A decrease in RT indicates an improved sensory-motor performance and enhanced processing ability of central nervous system. This may be due to greater arousal, faster rate of information processing, improved concentration and/ or an ability to ignore extraneous stimuli. This is of applied value in situations requiring faster reactivity such as sports, machine operation, race driving and specialised surgery. It may also be of value to train mentally retarded children and older sports persons who have prolonged RT.	Bhavanani, Ananda Balayogi;Madanmohan;Udupa, Kaviraja	2003 Jul
14719592	Non-drug therapy in prevention and control of hypertension.	Non-drug therapy is a very vital aspect in prevention and treatment of hypertension. The successive reports of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of Hypertension, WHO scientific report on primary prevention of essential hypertension and national High Blood Pressure Education Program's working groups report on primary prevention of hypertension have stressed on the non-drug therapy. Today a busy family physician does not spend enough time to explain to the patient various dietary and lifestyle modifications but straightaway prescribes the drugs. Every patient of hypertension from the stage of pre-hypertension to grade 2 hypertension should follow non-drug therapy. If non-drug therapy is strictly adhered, one can prevent cases of pre-hypertension from progressing to hypertension stage and one can reduce or stop the medications in Grade I (mild) hypertension. We have discussed the role of low salt, high potassium diet, role of caffeine intake, calcium and magnesium supplements, fish oil intake, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, role of physical exercise, stress reduction and bio-feedback, yoga, meditation and acupuncture. These recommendations regarding diet and lifestyle modifications should be targeted to population at large through public health authorities, non-government organisations and news media.

19570278	Project EX: A Program of Empirical Research on Adolescent Tobacco Use Cessation.	This paper presents the Project EX research program. The historical background for Project EX is presented, including a brief summary of reasons youth fail to quit tobacco use, the disappointing status of previous cessation research, and the teen cessation trial that provided the template for the current project (Project TNT). Next, program development studies for Project EX are described. Through use of focus groups, a theme study (concept evaluation of written activity descriptions), a component study, and pilot studies, an eight-session program was developed. This program involves novel activities (e.g., "talk show enactments," games, and alternative medicine-type activities such as yoga and meditation) in combination with motivation enhancement and cognitive-behavioral strategies to motivate and instruct in cessation initiation and maintenance efforts. The outcomes of the first experimental trial of Project EX, a school-based clinic program, are described, followed by a posthoc analysis of its effects mediation. A second EX study, a multiple baseline single group pilot study design in Wuhan, China, is described next. Description of a second experimental trial follows, which tested EX with nicotine gum versus a natural herb. A third experimental trial that tests a classroom prevention/cessation version of EX is then introduced. Finally, the implications of this work are discussed. The intent-to-treat quit rate for Project EX is approximately 15% across studies, double that of a standard care comparison. Effects last up to a six-month post-program at regular and alternative high schools. Through a systematic protocol of empirical program development and field trials, an effective and replicable model teen tobacco use cessation program is established. Future cessation work might expand on this work.	Sussman, Steve;McCuller, William J;Zheng, Hong;Pfingston, Yvonne M;Miyano, James;Dent, Clyde W	2004 Sep 15
14692015	Progressive muscle relaxation, yoga stretching, and ABC relaxation theory.	This study compared the psychological effects of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) and yoga stretching (hatha) exercises. Forty participants were randomly divided into two groups and taught PMR or yoga stretching exercises. Both groups practiced once a week for five weeks and were given the Smith Relaxation States Inventory before and after each session. As hypothesized, practitioners of PMR displayed higher levels of relaxation states (R-States) Physical Relaxation and Disengagement at Week 4 and higher levels of Mental Quiet and Joy as a posttraining aftereffect at Week 5. Contrary to what was hypothesized, groups did not display different levels of R-States Energized or Aware. Results suggest the value of supplementing traditional somatic conceptualizations of relaxation with the psychological approach embodied in ABC relaxation theory. Clinical and research implications are discussed.	Ghoncheh, Shahyad;Smith, Jonathan C	2004 Jan

14686082	Applied psychophysiology: beyond the boundaries of biofeedback (mending a wall, a brief history of our field, and applications to control of the muscles and cardiorespiratory systems).	The field of applied psychophysiology overlaps a number of others, from behavioral and psychosomatic medicine to Eastern disciplines and complementary medicine. Although the proliferation of societies and professional identities across these fields emphasizes this diversity, it also may hinder growth. The history of our field is one of innovation, often at odds with conventional wisdom and practice. It is important that this innovativeness not be sacrificed in a justified quest for professional respectability. This paper reviews the earliest research in biofeedback and applied psychophysiology, and modern applications and interpretations in the areas of muscular and autonomic control, including progressive relaxation and heart rate variability biofeedback, and draws parallels to disciplines of Yoga, QiGong, and Zen practices and their psychophysiological effects.

14640453	Test of significant differences with a priori probability in microarray experiments.	A traditional method for comparing two expression levels of genes in microarray experiments is the two-sample t-test. Because of the difficulty in using a large number of microarrays, an alternative method is required which can provide a reliable judgment of the comparison from a small number of replicates, even from a single pair of control and treatment. We present a method for detecting the changes in the gene expression levels under two different conditions in microarray experiments. Our method targets a single experiment for each condition, while retaining the statistical advantages of the t-test. The new proposals are: 1) standard deviation (SD) estimates of the expression levels which are an indicator for significant differences are given a priori as a function of the expression levels; 2) the limit of detection (LOD) for the expression levels is used to eliminate the majority of genes expressed at extremely low levels. The a priori SD estimates are obtained from six replicates under a fixed condition and are shown to be the approximate, but proper description of the expression uncertainty covering diverse conditions (e.g., different samples (human and rat) and different DNA chips). The LOD is defined as three times blank SD according to the IUPAC recommendation. A cell line (HL60) which will undergo macrophage differentiation on treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) is taken as an example. Our method is compared with the t-test for the data on duplicate TPA experiments and the former alone is evaluated with the data on a single TPA experiment.

14629072	Mood alterations in mindful versus aerobic exercise modes.	The results of most recent studies have generally indicated an improvement in mood after participation in aerobic exercise. However, only a few researchers have compared mindful modes of exercise with aerobic exercise to examine the effect of 1 single session of exercise on mood. In the present study, the authors assessed state anxiety, depressive mood, and subjective well-being prior to and following 1 class of 1 of 4 exercise modes: yoga, Feldenkrais (awareness through movement), aerobic dance, and swimming; a computer class served as a control. Participants were 147 female general curriculum and physical education teachers (mean age = 40.15, SD = 0.2) voluntarily enrolled in a 1-year enrichment program at a physical education college. Analyses of variance for repeated measures revealed mood improvement following Feldenkrais, swimming, and yoga but not following aerobic dance and computer lessons. Mindful low-exertion activities as well as aerobic activities enhanced mood in 1 single session of exercise. The authors suggest that more studies assessing the mood-enhancing benefits of mindful activities such as Feldenkrais and yoga are needed.	Netz, Yael;Lidor, Ronnie	2003 Sep
14620467	Foundations of clinical logagogy.	The meaning of the term "logagogy" is elucidated, and logagogic practices are outlined in the history of medicine. It is shown how the traditional medicine of India, Ayurveda, shows signs of logagogic practices (sattvavajaya), and that not only Ayurveda but also the famous Greek physician Galenus emphasize a philosophical approach to medicine. As Galenus's logagogic practices have their roots in the tradition of practical philosophy in Greek antiquity, the most important Greek schools of thought that are relevant to logagogic approaches are sketched. It is shown that the Stoics created a rationalistic system emphasizing the importance of the logos for human beings, and that Epicurus made advances in psychoeducation and cognitive reframing that are important for logagogic practices. These logagogic approaches of antiquity have been taken up by modern counseling in philosophical practices. The article closes with an outline of a clinical logagogy.	Buhler, Karl-Ernst	2003

14609363	Measures of Hindu pathways: development and preliminary evidence of reliability and validity.	The authors examined religious practices of Hindus in the United States and developed measures of their religious pathways. Based on reviews of the psychology of religion, Hindu literature, and interviews with Hindus (N=15), 4 religious pathways were identified: devotion, ethical action, knowledge, and physical restraint/yoga. Items reflecting these pathways were generated and administered to a pilot sample (N=42) and then mailed to a sample across the United States (N=182). Consistent with Hindu theology, participants endorsed 4 religious pathways. Results indicated that the measures of the religious pathways possessed adequate psychometric properties and were predictive of mental and physical well-being. Additional findings emphasized the need to attend to age, marital status, and acculturation when studying religious practices among Hindus.

14568288	Yoga: an adjunct to infertility treatment.	Yoga and meditation can help women experiencing the challenges of infertility. The practice of meditation and relaxation can help increase the clarity of the mind, maintain healthy body chemistry, and give patients the patience to undergo the rigors of infertility treatments. When one understands and can attain physical relaxation, one tends to feel better about the body itself, and begins to treat the body with more respect. This understanding can lead to healthier lifestyle habits as well as increased sensitivity regarding symptoms and body processes. This is beneficial to both doctor and patient as the patient can report with more clarity and sense cycles and physical issues more readily.	Khalsa, Hari Kaur	2003 Oct
14565554	Estimation of uncertainty in kinetic-colorimetric assay of bacterial endotoxins.	The relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of measurements is estimated in the kinetic-colorimetric assay of bacterial endotoxins without recourse to the usual repeated experiments. The measurements are the slopes of kinetic curves and two major factors are considered to cause the uncertainty of the measurements: (1) the pipetting of the sample and color development reagent; and (2) noise in the detection unit. The measurement R.S.D. is formulated as a function of endotoxin concentration. Two parameters (S.D. of the pipetted volumes and S.D. of the detector noise) are also required in the uncertainty equation, but no arbitrary coefficients are included. Since the S.D. values for pipettes and detector noise can be determined independently of the endotoxin assays, the measurement R.S.D. can be estimated by the above equation without repeating the assays. However, the calibration curve is necessary. The theoretical estimation is shown to be in good agreement with the experimental R.S.D. (n = 12) over a wide concentration range.

14560077	Anatomic study of the morphology of human cervical facet joint.	STUDY DESIGN: Geometrical properties of the facet joint including cartilage thickness and gap were obtained using human cadaver cervical spinal columns and cryomicrotomy techniques. OBJECTIVES: To determine the existence of level or gender dependency on facet joint morphology in the human cervical spine. BACKGROUND DATA: Although measurements of the human cervical spine have been reported in literature, to the best of knowledge of the authors, geometrical data on the facet joint structures such as the cartilage are not available. These data are important to understand the anatomy of the cervical spine and the role of the cartilage in sharing the external load during physiologic and traumatic situations. Furthermore, the data will assist mathematical modelers to accurately simulate this component of the cervical facet joint in finite element analysis of the spine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six unembalmed human cadaver cervical spinal columns were used. A heavy-duty cryomicrotome was used to obtain the geometrical characteristics. The specimens were sectioned in the sagittal plane at 20- to 40-microm intervals. Geometric properties of the facet joint width, cartilage thickness, and cartilage gap (defined as the distance from the ventral-most or dorsal-most region of the facet joint to the location where the cartilage began to appear) were extracted from the anatomic sections that were midsagittal with respect to the facet joints from occiput to T1 levels. Multiple factorial analysis of variance techniques were used to determine the statistical significance of various geometrical parameters obtained from the anatomic sections. RESULTS: The cartilage gap in the upper cervical spine (UCS) (C1-C2, i.e., UCS, 5.4% +/- 0.8) was lower (P < 0.0001) than the gap in the lower cervical spine (LCS) (C3-C7, i.e., LCS, 16.4% +/- 0.8). The gap at the ventral and dorsal regions was lower in the UCS (ventral 3.8% +/- 0.6, dorsal 7.0% +/- 1.4) than in the LCS (ventral 18.5% +/- 0.9, dorsal 14.2% +/- 1.1) with p values of less than 0.0001 and equal to 0.0004, respectively. Further, the gap in the dorsal region for females (14.7% +/- 1.8) was greater (P = 0.0523) than the gap for males (10.8% +/- 1.1). The overall mean facet cartilage thickness was lower (P = 0.0111) in females (0.6 mm +/- 0.1) than males (0.9 mm +/- 0.2) in the UCS. It was also lower (P = 0.0077) in females (0.4 mm +/- 0.02) than males (0.5 mm +/- 0.03) in the LCS. The facet joint width demonstrated differences only between the UCS and LCS (P < 0.0001), with higher magnitudes in the upper (17.4 mm +/- 0.4) than in the lower (11.3 mm +/- 0.3) region. CONCLUSIONS: Facet joint morphology varies with the regions of the cervical spine (upper vs. lower), gender (male vs. female), and location (dorsal vs. ventral). Because of the lack of intervertebral discs in the UCS region, variations in these geometrical characteristics affect the biomechanical behaviors of the human spine secondary to external loads. Furthermore, the lack of adequate cartilage in females may expose the underlying adjacent subchondral bone to direct stresses during normal physiologic and traumatic loads.

12951372	Study on lung function tests and prediction equations in Indian male children.	OBJECTIVE: The present study was carried out to evaluate lung functions and develop prediction equations in Indian boys. SUBJECTS: 1555 normal healthy schoolboys from Hyderabad city who were in the age group of 5 to 15 years were selected for the present study. DESIGN: The anthropometric parameters such as height, sitting height, weight, and chest circumference were measured and body surface area (BSA) and percent body fat (% Fat) were derived. The lung functions studied were FEV1, FVC, FEV1% and PEFR. RESULTS: The height, sitting height, weight, BSA, chest circumference, body fat as well as FEV1, FVC, FEV1 % and PEFR were comparable with Indian boys. The height for age, weight for age and weight for height were found to be lower than 50th percentile of NCHS standards in the subjects studied. Similarly the lung function values of the study population were found to be lower than the values of corresponding western population. CONCLUSION: Regression equations were derived to predict FEV1, FVC and PEFR using physical characteristics. Height, chest circumference and fat free mass were the best predictors for FEV1, FVC, and PEFR. Age, height, sitting height, weight, chest circumference and fat free mass showed significant association with lung functions.

12900677	Resistance training on physical performance in disabled older female cardiac patients.	PURPOSE: We evaluated the value of resistance training on measures of physical performance in disabled older women with coronary heart disease (CHD). METHODS: The study intervention consisted of a 6-month program of resistance training in a randomized controlled trial format. Training intensity was at 80% of the single-repetition maximal lift. Control patients performed light yoga and breathing exercises. Study participants included 42 women with CHD, all >or= 65 yr of age and community dwelling. Subjects were screened by questionnaire to have low self-reported physical function. The primary study measurements related to the performance of 16 household activities of the Continuous Scale Physical Functional Performance test (CSPFP). These ranged from dressing, to kitchen and cleaning activities, to carrying groceries and walking onto a bus with luggage, and a 6-min walk. Activities were measured in time to complete a task, weight carried during a task, or distance walked. Other measures included body composition, measures of aerobic fitness and strength, and questionnaire-based measures of physical function and depression score. RESULTS: Study groups were similar at baseline by age, aerobic capacity, strength, body composition, and in performing the CSPFP. After conditioning, 13 of 16 measured activities were performed more rapidly, or with increased weight carried, compared with the control group (all P < 0.05). Maximal power for activities that involved weight-bearing over a distance, increased by 40% (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Disabled older women with CHD who participate in an intense resistance-training program improve physical capacity over a wide range of household physical activities. Benefits extend beyond strength-related activities, as endurance, balance, coordination, and flexibility all improved. Strength training should be considered an important component in the rehabilitation of older women with CHD.

12885982	Effect of two breathing exercises (Buteyko and pranayama) in asthma: a randomised controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Patients with asthma are interested in the use of breathing exercises but their role is uncertain. The effects of the Buteyko breathing technique, a device which mimics pranayama (a yoga breathing technique), and a dummy pranayama device on bronchial responsiveness and symptoms were compared over 6 months in a parallel group study. METHODS: Ninety patients with asthma taking an inhaled corticosteroid were randomised after a 2 week run in period to Eucapnic Buteyko breathing, use of a Pink City Lung Exerciser (PCLE) to mimic pranayama, or a PCLE placebo device. Subjects practised the techniques at home twice daily for 6 months followed by an optional steroid reduction phase. Primary outcome measures were symptom scores and change in the dose of methacholine provoking a 20% fall in FEV(1) (PD(20)) during the first 6 months. RESULTS: Sixty nine patients (78%) completed the study. There was no significant difference in PD(20) between the three groups at 3 or 6 months. Symptoms remained relatively stable in the PCLE and placebo groups but were reduced in the Buteyko group. Median change in symptom scores at 6 months was 0 (interquartile range -1 to 1) in the placebo group, -1 (-2 to 0.75) in the PCLE group, and -3 (-4 to 0) in the Buteyko group (p=0.003 for difference between groups). Bronchodilator use was reduced in the Buteyko group by two puffs/day at 6 months; there was no change in the other two groups (p=0.005). No difference was seen between the groups in FEV(1), exacerbations, or ability to reduce inhaled corticosteroids. CONCLUSION: The Buteyko breathing technique can improve symptoms and reduce bronchodilator use but does not appear to change bronchial responsiveness or lung function in patients with asthma. No benefit was shown for the Pink City Lung Exerciser.	Cooper, S;Oborne, J;Newton, S;Harrison, V;Thompson Coon, J;Lewis, S;Tattersfield, A	2003 Aug
12883107	Mindfulness-based stress reduction in relation to quality of life, mood, symptoms of stress, and immune parameters in breast and prostate cancer outpatients.	OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the relationships between a mindfulness-based stress reduction meditation program for early stage breast and prostate cancer patients and quality of life, mood states, stress symptoms, lymphocyte counts, and cytokine production. METHODS: Forty-nine patients with breast cancer and 10 with prostate cancer participated in an 8-week MBSR program that incorporated relaxation, meditation, gentle yoga, and daily home practice. Demographic and health behavior variables, quality of life (EORTC QLQ C-30), mood (POMS), stress (SOSI), and counts of NK, NKT, B, T total, T helper, and T cytotoxic cells, as well as NK and T cell production of TNF, IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-10 were assessed pre- and postintervention. RESULTS: Fifty-nine and 42 patients were assessed pre- and postintervention, respectively. Significant improvements were seen in overall quality of life, symptoms of stress, and sleep quality. Although there were no significant changes in the overall number of lymphocytes or cell subsets, T cell production of IL-4 increased and IFN-gamma decreased, whereas NK cell production of IL-10 decreased. These results are consistent with a shift in immune profile from one associated with depressive symptoms to a more normal profile. CONCLUSIONS: MBSR participation was associated with enhanced quality of life and decreased stress symptoms in breast and prostate cancer patients. This study is also the first to show changes in cancer-related cytokine production associated with program participation.	Carlson, Linda E;Speca, Michael;Patel, Kamala D;Goodey, Eileen	2003 Jul-Aug

12735667	Breathing retraining for asthma.	Breathing retraining is used increasingly throughout the world by many patients with asthma in addition to their usual medical care. We undertook a systematic review of the literature in order to determine the effectiveness of breathing retraining in the management of asthma. Six randomised-controlled trials were identified that involved breathing retraining in asthma. Due to the variation in reported trial outcomes, limited reporting of study data and small number of included trials it was not possible to draw any firm conclusions as to its effectiveness. However, outcomes that were reported from individual trials do show that breathing retraining may have a role in the treatment and management of asthma. Further large-scale trials using breathing retraining techniques in asthma are required to address this important issue.	Ram, F S F;Holloway, E A;Jones, P W	2003 May
12708122	Effects of sirsasana (headstand) practice on autonomic and respiratory variables.	The present study had two aims: (1) To assess heart rate variability (HRV) along with non-specific autonomic measures (used in earlier studies), before and after two minutes of the head stand. (2) To compare changes in two categories of subjects, i.e., those who practiced the headstand in a traditional way (without any support) and those who used the support of the wall (a present day adaptation). The subjects were forty male volunteers (age range 19 to 36 years), with twenty subjects under each category. The following changes were significant after the practice, compared to values at baseline. (i) Both categories had an increase in the power of the low frequency component (LF) and a decrease in the high frequency component (HF) of the HRV spectrum, increased LF/HF ratio, and decreased heart rate. (ii) Subjects who practiced the head stand with the support of a wall showed reduced finger plethysmogram amplitude suggesting increased sympathetic vasomotor tone. (iii) Practicing the headstand without support was associated with an increase in the skin conductance level, suggestive of increased sympathetic sudomotor tone. Hence, both categories showed similar changes in the HRV components though changes in sympathetic vasomotor and sudomotor activity were different. These changes suggest sympathetic activation, irrespective of the method of practice.	Manjunath, N K;Telles, Shirley	2003 Jan
12708121	Effect of pranayam training on cardiac function in normal young volunteers.	Systolic time intervals (STI) are non-invasive and sensitive tests for measuring the ventricular performance. It has been reported that practice of pranayam modulates cardiac autonomic status and improves cardio-respiratory functions. Keeping this in view, the present study was designed to determine whether pranayam training has any effect on ventricular performance as measured by STI and cardiac autonomic function tests (AFT). Twenty four school children were randomly divided into two groups of twelve each. Group I (pranayam group) subjects were given training in nadishuddhi, mukh-bhastrika, pranav and savitri pranayams and practiced the same for 20 minutes daily for a duration of 3 months. Group II (control group) subjects were not given any pranayam training. STI (QS2, LVET and PEP) and AFT (RRIV and QT/QS2) were measured in both the groups at the beginning and again at the end of three months study period. Pranayam training produced an increase in RRIV and a decrease in QT/QS2, suggesting an enhanced parasympathetic and blunted sympathetic activity respectively. QS2, PEP and PEP/LVET increased significantly, whereas LVET was reduced significantly in pranayam group. In contrast, the changes in STI and AFT were much less marked in the control group. Our study shows that three months of pranayam training modulates ventricular performance by increasing parasympathetic activity and decreasing sympathetic activity. Further studies on a larger sample size may illustrate the underlying mechanism(s) involved in this alteration.

12705513	Effect of yoga-based and forced uninostril breathing on the autonomic nervous system.	Some reports have described the effects of forced uninostril breathing on autonomic activity as sex-specific, while other reports described selective effects of breathing through a specific nostril on the two divisions of the autonomic nervous system, irrespective of sex. There are also yoga breathing techniques which involve voluntary uninostril breathing. These techniques also influenced the autonomic activity based on the patent nostril rather than sex. These descriptions were in line with experiential observations of the ancient sages described in classical yoga texts. This paper summarizes these perspectives on uninostril breathing.

12683226	Effect of meditation on respiratory system, cardiovascular system and lipid profile.	In this study, respiratory functions, cardiovascular parameters and lipid profile of those practicing Raja Yoga meditation (short and long term meditators) were compared with those of nonmediators. Vital capacity, tidal volume and breath holding were significantly higher in short and long term meditators than nonmeditators. Long term mediators had significantly higher vital capacity and expiratory pressure than short term meditators. Diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower in both short and long term meditators as compared to nonmeditators. Heart rate was significantly lower in long term meditators than in short term meditators and nonmeditators. Lipid profile showed a significant lowering of serum cholesterol in short and long term meditators as compared to nonmeditators. Lipid profile of short and long term meditators was better than the profile of nonmeditators inspite of similar physical activity. This shows that Raja Yoga meditation provides significant improvements in respiratory functions, cardiovascular parameters and lipid profile.	Vyas, Rashmi;Dikshit, Nirupama	2002 Oct
12665179	Mind-body medicine: state of the science, implications for practice.	BACKGROUND: Although emerging evidence during the past several decades suggests that psychosocial factors can directly influence both physiologic function and health outcomes, medicine had failed to move beyond the biomedical model, in part because of lack of exposure to the evidence base supporting the biopsychosocial model. The literature was reviewed to examine the efficacy of representative psychosocial-mind-body interventions, including relaxation, (cognitive) behavioral therapies, meditation, imagery, biofeedback, and hypnosis for several common clinical conditions. METHODS: An electronic search was undertaken of the MEDLINE, PsycLIT, and the Cochrane Library databases and a manual search of the reference sections of relevant articles for related clinical trials and reviews of the literature. Studies examining mind-body interventions for psychological disorders were excluded. Owing to space limitations, studies examining more body-based therapies, such as yoga and tai chi chuan, were also not included. Data were extracted from relevant systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials. RESULTS: Drawing principally from systematic reviews and meta-analyses, there is considerable evidence of efficacy for several mind-body therapies in the treatment of coronary artery disease (eg, cardiac rehabilitation), headaches, insomnia, incontinence, chronic low back pain, disease and treatment-related symptoms of cancer, and improving postsurgical outcomes. We found moderate evidence of efficacy for mind-body therapies in the areas of hypertension and arthritis. Additional research is required to clarify the relative efficacy of different mind-body therapies, factors (such as specific patient characteristics) that might predict more or less successful outcomes, and mechanisms of action. Research is also necessary to examine the cost offsets associated with mind-body therapies. CONCLUSIONS: There is now considerable evidence that an array of mind-body therapies can be used as effective adjuncts to conventional medical treatment for a number of common clinical conditions.

12659826	Efficacy of rehabilitative therapy in regional musculoskeletal conditions.	This chapter reviews the best evidence for the rehabilitation of regional musculoskeletal conditions. Evidence-based efficacy of different modalities for treatment of musculoskeletal pain is presented, and the value of the patient's active participation in the rehabilitation programme is emphasized. The following modalities are commonly included in the holistic approach to patient-centred care and are reviewed: exercise therapy, thermotherapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and alternative therapies such as acupuncture, massage and yoga. A review of cognitive-behavioural strategies in pain management to prevent or treat fear-avoidance behaviour is also presented. Furthermore, the application of biomechanics in treating and preventing musculoskeletal disorders is illustrated. Moreover, the evidence for pain self-management to improve symptoms, health status and decrease the utilization of health care resources and cost is outlined. Finally, an overview will be presented, concerning the application of the evidence for treatment modalities to patient care, with focus on patient-centred, holistic treatment in a supportive setting. The following key questions/issues are addressed. What are the relevant therapeutic modalities for musculoskeletal pain disorders? What is the evidence of efficacy of these modalities in regional musculoskeletal conditions? What is the importance of understanding biomechanics? What is the importance of understanding fear-avoidance beliefs? What is the evidence for 'alternative' therapies such as acupuncture, massage or yoga? What is the evidence for 'pain self-management?' How does one apply the evidence for rehabilitation in regional musculoskeletal conditions into clinical practice?	Hanada, Edwin Yoshiyuki	2003 Feb
12614533	Psychophysiologic effects of Hatha Yoga on musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary function: a literature review.	Yoga has become increasingly popular in Western cultures as a means of exercise and fitness training; however, it is still depicted as trendy as evidenced by an April 2001 Time magazine cover story on "The Power of Yoga." There is a need to have yoga better recognized by the health care community as a complement to conventional medical care. Over the last 10 years, a growing number of research studies have shown that the practice of Hatha Yoga can improve strength and flexibility, and may help control such physiological variables as blood pressure, respiration and heart rate, and metabolic rate to improve overall exercise capacity. This review presents a summary of medically substantiated information about the health benefits of yoga for healthy people and for people compromised by musculoskeletal and cardiopulmonary disease.

12613400	Improvement in oxidative status with yogic breathing in young healthy males.	The modern living lifestyle is known to produce various physical and psychological stresses and subject the individual to produce oxidative stresses as well. The aim of this study has been to assess the effect of yogic breathing exercises (pranayama) on the oxidatives stress. The study group consisted of 30 young male volunteers, trained for the purpose of this study and an equal number of controls were used. The free radicals and Super oxide dismutase levels were measured before the study and at the end of the study. The free radicals were decreased significantly in the study group but the SOD was increased insignificantly as compared to the control group. Yogic breathing exercises not only help in relieving the stresses of life but also improve the antioxidant status of the individual. An improvement in the antioxidant status is helpful in preventing many pathological processes that are known with impaired antioxidant system of body.

12613394	Study of yoga asanas in assessment of pulmonary function in NIDDM patients.	Certain yoga asanas if practiced regularly are known to have beneficial effects on human body. These yoga practices might be interacting with various, somato-neuro-endocrine mechanisms to have therapeutic effects. The present study done in twenty four NIDDM patients of 30 to 60 year old, provides metabolic and clinical evidence of improvement in glycaemic control and pulmonary functions. These middle-aged subjects were type II diabetics on antihyperglycaemic and dietary regimen. Their baseline fasting and postprandial blood glucose and glycosylated Hb were monitored along with pulmonary function studies. The expert gave these patients training in yoga asanas and were pursed 30-40 min/day for 40 days under guidance. These asanas consisted of 13 well known postures, done in a sequence. After 40 days of yoga asanas regimen, the parameters were repeated. The results indicate that there was significant decrease in fasting blood glucose levels (basal 190.08 +/- 90.8 in mg/dl to 141.5 +/- 79.8 in mg/dl). The postprandial blood glucose levels also decreased (276.54 +/- 101.0 in mg/dl to 201.75 +/- 104.1 in mg/dl), glycosylated hemoglobin showed a decrease (9.03 +/- 1.4% to 7.83 +/- 2.6%). The FEV1, FVC, PEFR, MVV increased significantly (1.81 +/- 0.4 lt to 2.08 +/- 0.4 lt, 2.20 +/- 0.6 lt to 2.37 +/- 0.5 lt, 3.30 +/- 1.0 lt/s to 4.43 +/- 1.4 lt/s and 64.59 +/- 25.7 lt min to 76.28 +/- 28.1 lt/min respectively). FEV1/FVC% improved (85 +/- 0.2% to 89 +/- 0.1%). These findings suggest that better glycaemic control and pulmonary functions can be obtained in NIDDM cases with yoga asanas and pranayama. The exact mechanism as to how these postures and controlled breathing, interact with somato-neuro-endocrine mechanism affecting metabolic and pulmonary functions remains to be worked out.

12613393	Modulation of cold pressor-induced stress by shavasan in normal adult volunteers.	Shavasan is known to enhance one's ability to combat stressful situations. The present study was planned to determine if shavasan could modulate the physiological response to stress induced by cold pressor test (CPT) and the possible mechanisms involved. Ten normal adults were taught shavasan and practiced the same for a total duration of seven days. RR interval variation (RRIV), deep breathing difference (DBD), and heart rate, blood pressure & rate-pressure-product (RPP) response to CPT were measured before and immediately after shavasan. Shavasan produced a significant increase in DBD and an appreciable but statistically insignificant increase in RRIV suggesting an enhanced parasympathetic activity. Significant blunting of cold pressor-induced increase in heart rate, blood pressure and RPP by shavasan was seen during and even five minutes after CPT suggesting that shavasan reduces the load on the heart by blunting the sympathetic response. It is concluded that shavasan can enhance one's ability to withstand stress induced by CPT and this ability can be achieved even with seven days of shavasan training.

12613392	Effect of Yoga asanas on nerve conduction in type 2 diabetes.	Twenty Type 2 diabetic subjects between the age group of 30-60 years were studied to see the effect of 40 days of Yoga asanas on the nerve conduction velocity. The duration of diabetes ranged from 0-10 years. Subject suffering from cardiac, renal and proliferative retinal complications were excluded from the study Yoga asanas included Suryanamskar. Tadasan, Konasan, Padmasan Pranayam, Paschimottansan Ardhmatsyendrasan, Shavasan, Pavanmukthasan, Sarpasan and Shavasan. Subjects were called to the cardio-respiratory laboratory in the morning time and were given training by the Yoga expert. The Yoga exercises were performed for 30-40 minutes every day for 40 days in the above sequence. The subjects were prescribed certain medicines and diet. The basal blood glucose, nerve conduction velocity of the median nerve was measured and repeated after 40 days of Yogic regime. Another group of 20 Type 2 diabetes subjects of comparable age and severity, called the control group, were kept on prescribed medication and light physical exercises like walking. Their basal & post 40 days parameters were recorded for comparison. Right hand and left hand median nerve conduction velocity increased from 52.81 +/- 1.1 m/sec to 53.87 +/- 1.1 m/sec and 52.46 +/- 1.0 to 54.75 +/- 1/1 m/sec respectively. Control group nerve function parameters deteriorated over the period of study, indicating that diabetes is a slowly progressive disease involving the nerves. Yoga asanas have a beneficial effect on glycaemic control and improve nerve function in mild to moderate Type 2 diabetes with sub-clinical neuropathy.

12577909	Kaya Kalpa methods adopted by Siddars: a scientific approach.	Thirumular says in his "THIRUMANTHIRAM" the body is a sacred instrument to contain the soul and therefore must be nurtured well to safeguard the life. Thirumular is reported to have lived a long span of three thousand years according to tradition. The art of longevity and the attempts of immortalising the corporeal human body were the ultimate aims of Siddhars as understood from their numerous treatises on the art of rejuvenation - Thirumular Karpam - 300, Bohar Karpam - 300, Thiruvalluvur Karpam - 300 Yugimuni Karpam - 300 etc. which form some of the excellence works in this regard. One of the means to rejuvenate the body was achieved through the art of breathing (Pranayama) which has a direct bearing on the basal metabolic rate and the span of longevity. In this paper an attempt has been made to throw some light on the scientific basis of the various Kaya Kalpa methods adopted by Siddhars.	Rajalakshmi, S;Veluchamy, G	2000 Jul-Dec
12571369	A metaphysics of living systems: the Yoga-Vasistha view.	The Yoga-Vasistha is a rich and complex philosophical 'poem' (kavya) of epic length, written in classical Sanskrit by an unknown author some time between the 6th and 13th centuries CE, probably around the 7th century. It is notable for its eloquent praise of self-effort and enquiry or analysis, and for its severe disparagement of the notion of fate. It views consciousness as (a) characterizing all living forms (including plant and insect life), (b) being atomic, and (c) analogous to the emergence of waves and whirlpools in water; it therefore grapples with what today would be called the problems of reductionism and emergentism. Notions of the survival of the fittest, and of a dynamic process of creation and loss, are expressed with characteristic force. The paper presents a selection of verses (in an English translation) setting forth these views, and a brief analysis of their implications.	Narasimha, Roddam	2002 Dec
12535461	Non-surgical treatment (other than steroid injection) for carpal tunnel syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Non-surgical treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is frequently offered to those with mild to moderate symptoms. The effectiveness and duration of benefit from non-surgical treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome remain unknown. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of non-surgical treatment (other than steroid injection) for carpal tunnel syndrome versus a placebo or other non-surgical, control interventions in improving clinical outcome. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group specialised register (searched March 2002), MEDLINE (searched January 1966 to February 7 2001), EMBASE (searched January 1980 to March 2002), CINAHL (searched January 1983 to December 2001), AMED (searched 1984 to January 2002), Current Contents (January 1993 to March 2002), PEDro and reference lists of articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised studies in any language of participants with the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome who had not previously undergone surgical release. We considered all non-surgical treatments apart from local steroid injection. The primary outcome measure was improvement in clinical symptoms after at least three months following the end of treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three reviewers independently selected the trials to be included. Two reviewers independently extracted data. Studies were rated for their overall quality. Relative risks and weighted mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the primary and secondary outcomes in each trial. Results of clinically and statistically homogeneous trials were pooled to provide estimates of the efficacy of non-surgical treatments. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-one trials involving 884 people were included. A hand brace significantly improved symptoms after four weeks (weighted mean difference (WMD) -1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.29 to -0.85) and function (WMD -0.55; 95% CI -0.82 to -0.28). In an analysis of pooled data from two trials (63 participants) ultrasound treatment for two weeks was not significantly beneficial. However one trial showed significant symptom improvement after seven weeks of ultrasound (WMD -0.99; 95% CI -1.77 to - 0.21) which was maintained at six months (WMD -1.86; 95% CI -2.67 to -1.05). Four trials involving 193 people examined various oral medications (steroids, diuretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) versus placebo. Compared to placebo, pooled data for two-week oral steroid treatment demonstrated a significant improvement in symptoms (WMD -7.23; 95% CI -10.31 to -4.14). One trial also showed improvement after four weeks (WMD -10.8; 95% CI -15.26 to -6.34). Compared to placebo, diuretics or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs did not demonstrate significant benefit. In two trials involving 50 people, vitamin B6 did not significantly improve overall symptoms. In one trial involving 51 people yoga significantly reduced pain after eight weeks (WMD -1.40; 95% CI -2.73 to -0.07) compared with wrist splinting. In one trial involving 21 people carpal bone mobilisation significantly improved symptoms after three weeks (WMD -1.43; 95% CI -2.19 to -0.67) compared to no treatment. In one trial involving 50 people with diabetes, steroid and insulin injections significantly improved symptoms over eight weeks compared with steroid and placebo injections. Two trials involving 105 people compared ergonomic keyboards versus control and demonstrated equivocal results for pain and function. Trials of magnet therapy, laser acupuncture, exercise or chiropractic care did not demonstrate symptom benefit when compared to placebo or control. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence shows significant short-term benefit from oral steroids, splinting, ultrasound, yoga and carpal bone mobilisation. Other non-surgical treatments do not produce significant benefit. More trials are needed to compare treatments and ascertain the duration of benefit.	O'Connor, D;Marshall, S;Massy-Westropp, N	2003
12522587	Hatha Yoga therapy management of urologic disorders.	Hatha Yoga (often referred to as "yoga") is an ancient type of physical and mental exercise that has been used as a therapeutic modality in traditional Indian medicine for centuries. Yoga as a complementary modality in western medicine is more recent and continues to grow. Chronic urologic disorders are often difficult to diagnose because their presentation mimic other medical conditions and are often a diagnosis of exclusion. Treatment is also frustrating because the more traditional treatments are often unsuccessful in managing chronic disorders. Health care practitioners are often forced to look elsewhere for other modalities to provide pain relief and improve quality of life. Hatha Yoga is one of these modalities which has been extremely useful to many patients in reducing the suffering seen with chronic urologic conditions such as: prostatodynia, chronic orchitis, chronic epididymitis, vulvodynia, interstitial cystitis, etc.	Ripoll, Emmey;Mahowald, Dawn	2002 Nov

12463606	Culture and complementary therapies.	Complementary therapies are becoming increasingly popular in cultures dominated by biomedicine. Modalities are often extracted from various healing systems and cultural contexts and integrated into health care, expanding the focus from treatment of disease to the promotion of health. The cultural aspects of biomedicine are presented and compared and contrasted with other healing systems. Three healing systems; traditional Chinese medicine, Yoga, with roots in Ayurvedic medicine and Shamanic healing illustrate these fundamental differences in approaches to healing. A reverse example of isolating one healing intervention from biomedicine and interpreting it through other cultural lenses is presented. Implications are drawn for practice and research.

12454346	Yoga for stress reduction and injury prevention at work.	At work employees face numerous psychological stressors that can undermine their work performance. These stressors, stemming from a variety of possible causes, have enormous health and financial impacts on employees as well as employers. Stress has been shown to be one of the factors leading to musculo-skeletal disorders (MSDs) such as: include back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, shoulder or neck tension, eye strain, or headaches. Yoga is an ancient form of exercise that can reduce stress and relieve muscular tension or pain. Practicing yoga at the workplace teaches employees to use relaxation techniques to reduce stress and risks of injury on the job. Yoga at the workplace is a convenient and practical outlet that improves work performance by relieving tension and job stress.	Gura, Shira Taylor	2002
12435217	Complementary and alternative medicine for menopausal symptoms: a review of randomized, controlled trials.	BACKGROUND: Women commonly use soy products, herbs, and other complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies for menopausal symptoms. Randomized, controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy and short-term safety of these therapies. PURPOSE: To review randomized, controlled trials of CAM therapies for menopausal symptoms in order to better inform practice and guide future research. DATA SOURCES: Searches of MEDLINE for articles published from January 1966 through March 2002, of the Alternative and Complementary Database (AMED) of the British Library for articles published from January 1985 through December 2000, and of the authors' own extensive files. Search terms were hot flash/flush, menopause, and climacteric, combined with phytoestrogens, alternative medicine, herbal medicine, traditional medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM ), Ayurveda, naturopathy, chiropractic, osteopathy, massage, yoga, relaxation therapy, homeopathy, aromatherapy, and therapeutic touch. STUDY SELECTION: 29 randomized, controlled clinical trials of CAM therapies for hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms were identified; of these, 12 dealt with soy or soy extracts, 10 with herbs, and 7 with other CAM therapies. DATA EXTRACTION: Each author extracted information from half of the studies on the number of patients, study design, outcome measures, and results; the other author then checked these results. DATA SYNTHESIS: Soy seems to have modest benefit for hot flashes, but studies are not conclusive. Isoflavone preparations seem to be less effective than soy foods. Black cohosh may be effective for menopausal symptoms, especially hot flashes, but the lack of adequate long-term safety data (mainly on estrogenic stimulation of the breast or endometrium) precludes recommending long-term use. Single clinical trials have found that dong quai, evening primrose oil, a Chinese herb mixture, vitamin E, and acupuncture do not affect hot flashes; two trials have shown that red clover has no benefit for treating hot flashes. CONCLUSIONS: Black cohosh and foods that contain phytoestrogens show promise for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Clinical trials do not support the use of other herbs or CAM therapies. Long-term safety data on individual isoflavones or isoflavone concentrates are not available.	Kronenberg, Fredi;Fugh-Berman, Adriane	2002 Nov 19
12426761	The new world of medicine: prospecting for health.	Throughout past millennia, human beings have shared the common goal of improving health for longevity. However, different cultures around the world have developed their own approaches to achieve this goal. Various traditions have emerged, rendering distinct medical systems such as Ayurveda, Yoga, Chinese-Japanese medicine, shamanism, and Native American healing. Traditional medicine involves a holistic approach to the human body to integrate healing with culture, environment, and tradition. Modern allopathic medicine originated from Greco-Roman Medicine and Northern European traditions and is built on the science of anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry and the structure-function relationship between cells, tissues, and organs. This foundation focuses on diagnosis, treatment, and cure for acute illnesses via potent pharmaceutical drugs, surgery, radiation, and other treatment modalities. Within this past century, we have doubled the life-span of human beings. Genomic medicine, including stem cell research, cloning, and gene therapy, will increase our capability to treat even more diseases. In the new millennium, we face more chronic illnesses related to aging, environment, and lifestyle, such as cancer, diabetes. osteoporosis, and cardiovascular diseases. Thus, health care providers face the challenge of prospecting for health and disease prevention. Modern science and medical advancements provide the rationale for the integration of various traditional healing techniques, which have been termed Alternative and Complementary Medicine, to promote healing, health, and longevity. Advances in medicine must include the holistic approach of traditional medicine to face the current challenges in health care. Therefore, the New World of Medicine must fuse the antiquity of ancient healing with the innovations of modern medicine to increase life-expectancy and improve quality of life throughout the world.

12422290	Complementary and alternative medicine in asthma: do they work?	OBJECTIVE: An increasing number of patients with asthma are attracted by complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Therefore, it is of importance that scientific evidence about the efficacy of this type of therapy is regarded. METHOD: We searched the electronic databases Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library for controlled trials and systematic reviews to evaluate the evidence of the most popular alternative therapies, i.e. acupuncture, homeopathy, breathing techniques, herbal and nutritional therapies. RESULTS: Claims that acupuncture is effective for the treatment of asthma are not based on well-performed clinical trials. The role of homeopathy in the treatment of asthma needs further evaluation. Breathing techniques, e.g. improved control of breathing by yoga, may contribute to the control of asthma symptoms, but due to the small number of controlled trials and due to the small number of patients it is not possible to make firm judgments. Herbal remedies cannot be recommended based on the available evidence. Recommendations for a diet high in vitamin C and marine fatty acids are not harmful, but evidence for clinically meaningful effects are scant. CONCLUSION: Up to now evidence is lacking that alternative forms of medicine are more effective than placebo in asthma. However, lack of evidence does not always mean that treatment is ineffective, but it could mean that effectiveness has not been adequately investigated. High quality research as in conventional therapy should be fostered in complementary medicine.	Steurer-Stey, Claudia;Russi, Erich W;Steurer, Johann	2002 Jun 29

12408279	Lifestyle modification in management of diabetes mellitus.	India has the largest diabetic population in the world. Change in eating habits, increasing weight and decreased physical activity are major factors leading to increased incidence of type 2 diabetes. Obesity is the most important modifiable risk factor. Smoking is an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diet and exercise are primary therapeutic options for its management. Dietary management should not only aim to achieve glycaemic control but to normalise dyslipidaemia. Smoking cessation reduces the risk of morbidity and mortality in CAD. Exercise improves the condition of a diabetic patient. Exercise includes yoga practices which have a role to play in the prevention of type 2 diabetes.	Sahay, B K;Sahay, Rakesh K	2002 Mar
12391710	Respiratory and allergic diseases: from upper respiratory tract infections to asthma.	Patients with asthma and allergic rhinitis may benefit from hydration and a diet low in sodium, omega-6 fatty acids, and transfatty acids, but high in omega-3 fatty acids (i.e., fish, almonds, walnuts, pumpkin, and flax seeds), onions, and fruits and vegetables (at least five servings a day). Physicians may need to be more cautious when prescribing antibiotics to children in their first year of life when they are born to families with a history of atopy. More research is needed to establish whether supplementation with probiotics (lactobacillus and bifidobacterium) during the first year of life or after antibiotic use decreases the risk of developing asthma and allergic rhinitis. Despite a theoretic basis for the use of vitamin C supplements in asthmatic patients, the evidence is still equivocal, and long-term studies are needed. The evidence is stronger for exercise-induced asthma, in which the use of vitamin C supplementation at a dosage of 1 to 2 g per day may be helpful. It is also possible that fish oil supplements, administered in a dosage of 1 to 1.2 g of EPA and DHA per day, also may be helpful to some patients with asthma. Long-term studies of fish oil and vitamin C are needed for more definite answers. For the patient interested in incorporating nutritional approaches, vitamin C and fish oils have a safe profile. However, aspirin-sensitive individuals should avoid fish oils, and red blood cell magnesium levels may help in making the decision whether to use additional magnesium supplements. Combination herbal formulas should be used in the treatment of asthma with medical supervision and in collaboration with an experienced herbalist or practitioner of TCM. Safe herbs, such as Boswellia and gingko, may be used singly as adjuncts to a comprehensive plan of care if the patient and practitioner have an interest in trying them while staying alert for drug-herb interactions. No data on the long-term use of these single herbs in asthma exist. For the motivated patient, mind-body interventions such as yoga, hypnosis, and biofeedback-assisted relaxation and breathing exercises are beneficial for stress reduction in general and may be helpful in further controlling asthma. Encouraging parents to learn how to massage their asthmatic children may appeal to some parents and provide benefits for parents and children alike. Acupuncture and chiropractic treatment cannot be recommended at this time, although some patients may derive benefit because of the placebo effect. For patients with allergic rhinitis, there are no good clinical research data on the use of quercetin and vitamin C. Similarly, freeze-dried stinging nettle leaves may be tried, but the applicable research evidence also is poor. Further studies are needed to assess the efficacy of these supplements and herbs. Homeopathic remedies based on extreme dilutions of the allergen may be beneficial in allergic rhinitis but require collaboration with an experienced homeopath. There are no research data on constitutional homeopathic approaches to asthma and allergic rhinitis. Patients with COPD are helped by exercise, pulmonary rehabilitation, and increased caloric protein and fat intake. Vitamin C and n-3 supplements are safe and reasonable; however, studies are needed to establish their efficacy in COPD. On the other hand, there are convincing data in favor of N-acetyl-cysteine supplementation for the patient with COPD at doses ranging between 400 and 1200 mg daily. Red blood cell magnesium levels may guide the use of magnesium replacement. The use of L-carnitine and coenzyme Q10 in patients with COPD needs further study. The addition of essential oils to the dietary regimen of patients with chronic bronchitis is worth exploring. Patients with upper respiratory tract infections can expect a shorter duration of symptoms by taking high doses of vitamin C (2 g) with zinc supplements, preferably the nasal zinc gel, at the onset of their symptoms. Adding an herb such as echinacea or Andrographis shortens the duration of the common cold. The one study on Elderberry's use for the flu was encouraging, and the data on the homeopathic remedy Oscillococcinum interesting, but more studies should be performed. Saline washes may be helpful to patients with allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis. Patients also may try the German combination (available in the United States) of elderberry, vervain, gentian, primrose, and sorrel that has been tested in randomized clinical trials. Bromelain is safe to try; the trials of bromelain supplementation were promising but were never repeated. The preceding suggestions need to be grounded in a program based on optimal medical management. Patients need to be well educated in the proper medical management of their disease and skilled at monitoring disease stability and progress. Asthmatic patients need to monitor their bronchodilator usage and peak flow meter measurements to step up their medical treatment in a timely manner, if needed. Patients welcome physician guidance when exploring the breadth of treatments available today. A true patient-physician partnership is always empowering to patients who are serious about regaining their function and health.	Jaber, Raja	2002 Jun
12388941	[Dysmenorrhea, endometriosis and premenstrual syndrome].	Dysmenorrhea is the most frequent gynaecological problem in adolescent girls (the prevalence is 80-90%). Genetic influence, style of life (diet and physical activity) social, economical and cultural factors can affect symptoms. Prostaglandins and leucotrienes produced by endometrium, abnormal uterine smooth muscle contractility and modifications of the local blood flow are responsible for abdominal pain. Frequently daily activities are negatively affected (missing time at school) dysmenorrhoea can be primary or secondary to anatomical anomalies of internal genitalia or presence of synechie (post surgery or inflammatory pelvic diseases). Therapy may consist of traditional medicine (relaxing techniques such as yoga, agopuncture, mild analgesic drugs or more effective FANS). In case of therapeutical failure, contraceptive and/or GnRH agonists can represent the last choice. Endometriosis is less frequent, etiopatogenesis is not completely understood, but the anatomical lesions consist of an oestrogen-dependent neo-angiogenesis. Oestrogen inhibitors, oral contraceptives or GnRH agonists may be useful in treating this pathology. In case of drug failure surgery is suggested. For the effective diagnosis laparoscopy and biopsy are absolutely necessary. Premenstrual syndrome is cyclical, extremely complex, unusual in adolescent girls, sometimes associated to pre-existent psychic disorders. It can be treated with symptomatic drugs or, more recently, using drugs that alter the levels of serotonin, but their use in the adolescent patient is not yet recommended.	Tonini, G	2002 Dec

12356250	A review of complementary and alternative medicine use for treating chronic facial pain.	BACKGROUND: The authors compiled information on the prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine, or CAM, use, as well as on reports of randomized clinical trials of CAM modalities used to treat chronic facial pain. TYPES OF STUDIES REVIEWED: The authors searched several databases for reports of clinical trials randomizing patients who had facial pain to a CAM intervention or to a control or comparison group. Search terms included "complementary," "alternative," "acupuncture," "biofeedback," "relaxation," "herbal," "meditation," "massage," "yoga," "chiropractic," "homeopathic" and "naturopathic." RESULTS: Three acupuncture trials, eight biofeedback trials and three relaxation trials met the authors' inclusion criteria. Across studies, results suggested that acupuncture, biofeedback and relaxation were comparable to conservative treatment (for example, an intraoral appliance) and warranted further study. The authors did not locate any randomized clinical trials that tested the effects of homeopathy, naturopathy, chiropractic, massage, meditation, yoga or herbal remedies for chronic facial pain. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Significant gaps in the scientific knowledge base limit the accuracy with which dental professionals can guide their patients regarding CAM approaches used to treat chronic facial pain.

21206593	'Mind' in Indian philosophy.	The place of mind in the philosophical systems of India is briefly discussed. The philosophies selected are - Vedas, Upanishads, Six systems of philosophies (saddarsanas), Gita and materialistic school of Carvaaka. That mind is of subtle physical nature and that self is postulated as higher than mind in the hierarchy is being pointed out. Mind can be man's own friend to elevate him or his foe debasing him. Modern neuro - science and the ancient materialistic schools do not subscribe to the existence of self. An integrated approach extending beyond the mind in psychiatric care is suggested. Scientific and technological advances do not necessarily preclude a transcendent (spiritual) dimension to the total care.	Rao, A Venkoba	2002 Oct

12231432	Non-linear dynamic complexity of the human EEG during meditation.	We used non-linear analysis to investigate the dynamical properties underlying the EEG in the model of Sahaja Yoga meditation. Non-linear dimensional complexity (DCx) estimates, indicating complexity of neuronal computations, were analyzed in 20 experienced meditators during rest and meditation using 62-channel EEG. When compared to rest, the meditation was accompanied by a focused decrease of DCx estimates over midline frontal and central regions. By contrast, additionally computed linear measures exhibited the opposite direction of changes: power in the theta-1 (4-6 Hz), theta-2 (6-8 Hz) and alpha-1 (8-10 Hz) frequency bands was increased over these regions. The DCx estimates negatively correlated with theta-2 and alpha-1 and positively with beta-3 (22-30 Hz) band power. It is suggested that meditative experience, characterized by less complex dynamics of the EEG, involves 'switching off' irrelevant networks for the maintenance of focused internalized attention and inhibition of inappropriate information. Overall, the results point to the idea that dynamically changing inner experience during meditation is better indexed by a combination of non-linear and linear EEG variables.

The ventilatory response to hypercapnia and arterial blood gases during ujjai respiration of once per minute for an hour were determined in a professional hatha yogi.

12214961	Biomechanical analyses of whiplash injuries using an experimental model.	Neck pain and headaches are the two most common symptoms of whiplash. The working hypothesis is that pain originates from excessive motions in the upper and lower cervical segments. The research design used an intact human cadaver head-neck complex as an experimental model. The intact head-neck preparation was fixed at the thoracic end with the head unconstrained. Retroreflective targets were placed on the mastoid process, anterior regions of the vertebral bodies, and lateral masses at every spinal level. Whiplash loading was delivered using a mini-sled pendulum device. A six-axis load cell and an accelerometer were attached to the inferior fixation of the specimen. High-speed video cameras were used to obtain the kinematics. During the initial stages of loading, a transient decoupling of the head occurs with respect to the neck exhibiting a lag of the cranium. The upper cervical spine-head undergoes local flexion concomitant with a lag of the head while the lower column is in local extension. This establishes a reverse curvature to the head-neck complex. With continuing application of whiplash loading, the inertia of the head catches up with the neck. Later, the entire head-neck complex is under an extension mode with a single extension curvature. The lower cervical facet joint kinematics demonstrates varying local compression and sliding. While the anterior- and posterior-most regions of the facet joint slide, the posterior-most region of the joint compresses more than the anterior-most region. These varying kinematics at the two ends of the facet joint result in a pinching mechanism. Excessive flexion of the posterior upper cervical regions can be correlated to headaches. The pinching mechanism of the facet joints can be correlated to neck pain. The kinematics of the soft tissue-related structures explain the mechanism of these common whiplash associated disorders.

12186115	Therapeutic potential of yoga practices in modifying cardiovascular risk profile in middle aged men and women.	AIMS OF STUDY: To study effect of yoga on the physiological, psychological well being, psychomotor parameter and modifying cardiovascular risk factors in mild to moderate hypertensive patients. METHODS: Twenty patients (16 males, 4 females) in the age group of 35 to 55 years with mild to moderate essential hypertension underwent yogic practices daily for one hour for three months. Biochemical, physiological and psychological parameters were studied prior and following period of three months of yoga practices, biochemical parameters included, blood glucose, lipid profile, catecholmines, MDA, Vit. C cholinesterase and urinary VMA. Psychological evaluation was done by using personal orientation inventory and subjective well being. RESULTS: Results showed decrease in blood pressure and drug score modifying risk factors, i.e. blood glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides decreased overall improvement in subjective well being and quality of life. There was decrease in VMA catecholamine, and decrease MDA level suggestive decrease sympathetic activity and oxidant stress. CONCLUSION: Yoga can play an important role in risk modification for cardiovascular diseases in mild to moderate hypertension.

12126175	Changes in spirituality and well-being in a retreat program for cardiac patients.	CONTEXT: Many epidemiological studies indicate that spirituality or religion are positively correlated with health measures, but research is needed on interventions that change spirituality to verify that it actually affects health and to justify suggestions that changes in spiritual practices or beliefs may have health benefits. However, it is not clear that health interventions can influence spirituality or which techniques are effective. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether participation in a retreat program for cardiac patients and their partners resulted in changes in spirituality and whether changes in spirituality were related to changes in well-being meaning in life, anger, and confidence in handling problems. DESIGN: Participants filled out questionnaires before and after participating in the retreat. SETTING: Retreats were sponsored by the Health Promotion and Wellness Program, University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, and were held in a remote training center. PARTICIPANTS: Notices were sent to cardiac rehabilitation programs and directly to heart patients, resulting in the enrollment of 72 first-time participants. INTERVENTION: The 2.5-day educational retreats included discussion and opportunities to experience healthy lifestyle options. Exercise, nutrition, stress management techniques, communication skills that enhance social support, and spiritual principles of healing were incorporated. Experiential practices included yoga, meditation, visualization, and prayer. RESULTS: Of the participants, 78% reported increased spirituality after the retreat. Changes in spirituality were positively associated with increased well-being meaning in life, confidence in handling problems, and decreased tendency to become angry. CONCLUSIONS: Programs that explore spirituality in a health context can result in increased spirituality that is associated with increased well-being and related measures. Many patients and their families want to integrate the spiritual and health dimensions of their lives. Further work is needed to develop healthcare settings that can support this integration.

12119799	Nondrug interventions in hypertension prevention and control.	This review was undertaken to address the relation of various factors to HBP and their potential for preventing and controlling this widespread problem. With respect to salt intake and BP, the 1999 Workshop on Sodium and Blood Pressure of the (US) National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [5] will serve the reader well as a point of departure. The body of the present review provides more detailed discussion especially of recent epidemiologic research, including the DASH-Sodium trial, published more recently than the proceedings of that workshop. The DASH-Sodium trial demonstrates significant increases in SBP and DBP, with sodium intake greater than 65 mmol/d (= 3.7 g NaCl--see equivalencies in Appendix A) and with the usual American diet (versus the DASH diet). These results provide substantial evidence against current dietary practices in many populations where daily intakes of salt are much higher than recommended. We also have addressed alcohol consumption, micronutrients/macronutrients, physical activity and inactivity, obesity, cigarette smoking, and alternative approaches to treatment such as stress reduction/biofeedback, yoga/meditation, and acupuncture. Evidence for the efficacy of certain nonpharmacologic approaches to preventing and controlling HBP is strong. This evidence offers a basis for public health policies and clinical approaches that can greatly affect the incidence and consequences of HBP in the population at large. What is needed now is implementation of the policies and practices addressed here. Unless such action is taken on a large scale, we will have made poor use of the knowledge accrued over decades of research.

12116551	[Essential hypertension and stress. When do yoga, psychotherapy and autogenic training help?].	Psychosocial factors play an important role in the development and course of essential hypertension, although "stress" can account for only 10% of blood pressure variance. A variety of psychotherapeutic interventions, such as relaxation techniques (autogenic training or progressive muscular relaxation), behavioral therapy or biofeedback techniques, can lower elevated blood pressure by an average of 10 mmHg (systolic) and 5 mmHg (diastolic). As a "secondary effect", such measures may also prompt the hypertensive to adopt a more health-conscious lifestyle.	Herrmann, J M	2002 May 9

12090377	Psychological aspects of asthma.	Asthma can be affected by stress, anxiety, sadness, and suggestion, as well as by environmental irritants or allergens, exercise, and infection. It also is associated with an elevated prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders. Asthma and these psychological states and traits may mutually potentiate each other through direct psychophysiological mediation, nonadherence to medical regimen, exposure to asthma triggers, and inaccuracy of asthma symptom perception. Defensiveness is associated with inaccurate perception of airway resistance and stress-related bronchoconstriction. Asthma education programs that teach about the nature of the disease, medications, and trigger avoidance tend to reduce asthma morbidity. Other promising psychological interventions as adjuncts to medical treatment include training in symptom perception, stress management, hypnosis, yoga, and several biofeedback procedures.

21206574	Mind in ayurveda.	Ayurveda now among the alternative complementary systems of medicine is over 5000 years old. Its origin and the compilation of Caraka Samhita are noted. The nature of mind as a sensory and a motor organ, its structure and functions are discussed. The concept of Thdosha theory and Trigunas are explained besides the so-called master-forms of Doshas namely Prana, Tejas and Ojas. The constituional and tempermental types depending upon the doshas are described. These determine diagnoses and guide treatment. Ayurveda is highlighted as a holistic system with its concern for prevention of disease and promotion of health. Disease denotes failure of prophylaxis. Some methods of Ayurvedic therapy are mentioned.	Rao, A Venkoba	2002 Jul
12065003	Effectiveness of complementary and self-help treatments for depression.	OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence for the effectiveness of complementary and self-help treatments for depression. DATA SOURCES: Systematic literature search using PubMed, PsycLit, the Cochrane Library and previous review papers. DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirty-seven treatments were identified and grouped under the categories of medicines, physical treatments, lifestyle, and dietary changes. We give a description of each treatment, the rationale behind the treatment, a review of studies on effectiveness, and the level of evidence for the effectiveness studies. RESULTS: The treatments with the best evidence of effectiveness are St John's wort, exercise, bibliotherapy involving cognitive behaviour therapy and light therapy (for winter depression). There is some limited evidence to support the effectiveness of acupuncture, light therapy (for non-seasonal depression), massage therapy, negative air ionisation (for winter depression), relaxation therapy, S-adenosylmethionine, folate and yoga breathing exercises. CONCLUSION: Although none of the treatments reviewed is as well supported by evidence as standard treatments such as antidepressants and cognitive behaviour therapy, many warrant further research.

12061588	Yoga-based guided relaxation reduces sympathetic activity judged from baseline levels.	35 male volunteers whose ages ranged from 20 to 46 years were studied in two sessions of yoga-based guided relaxation and supine rest. Assessments of autonomic variables were made for 15 subjects, before, during, and after the practices, whereas oxygen consumption and breath volume were recorded for 25 subjects before and after both types of relaxation. A significant decrease in oxygen consumption and increase in breath volume were recorded after guided relaxation (paired t test). There were comparable reductions in heart rate and skin conductance during both types of relaxation. During guided relaxation the power of the low frequency component of the heart-rate variability spectrum reduced, whereas the power of the high frequency component increased, suggesting reduced sympathetic activity. Also, subjects with a baseline ratio of LF/HF > 0.5 showed a significant decrease in the ratio after guided relaxation, while subjects with a ratio < or = 0.5 at baseline showed no such change. The results suggest that sympathetic activity decreased after guided relaxation based on yoga, depending on the baseline levels.	Vempati, R P;Telles, Shirley	2002 Apr

12040766	Aerobic capacity & perceived exertion after practice of Hatha yogic exercises.	BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Reports on the effect of yogic exercises on aerobic capacity are few. There is also no literature available on the effect of yogic exercise on perceived exertion (PE) after maximal exercise. In this study the effect of training in Hatha yogic exercises on aerobic capacity and PE after maximal exercise was observed. METHODS: Forty men from the Indian army (aged 19-23 yr) were administered maximal exercise on a bicycle ergometer in a graded work load protocol. The oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide output, pulmonary ventilation, respiratory rate, heart rate (HR) etc., at maximal exercise and PE score immediately thereafter were recorded. The subjects were divided into two equal groups. Twelve subjects dropped out during the course of study. One group (yoga, n = 17) practiced Hatha yogic exercises for 1 h every morning (6 days in a week) for six months. The other group (PT, n = 11) underwent conventional physical exercise training during the same period. Both groups participated daily in different games for 1 h in the afternoon. In the 7th month, tests for maximal oxygen consumption (VO2Max) and PE were repeated on both groups of subjects. RESULTS: Absolute value of VO2Max increased significantly (P < 0.05) in the yoga group after 6 months of training. The PE score after maximal exercise decreased significantly (P < 0.001) in the yoga group after 6 months but the PT group showed no change. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: The practice of Hatha yogic exercises along with games helps to improve aerobic capacity like the practice of conventional exercises (PT) along with games. The yoga group performed better than the PT group in terms of lower PE after exhaustive exercise.	Ray, U S;Sinha, B;Tomer, O S;Pathak, A;Dasgupta, T;Selvamurthy, W	2001 Dec

12018559	Status of lifestyle modifications in hypertension.	Hypertension is essentially the elevation of arterial blood pressure beyond an arbitrary cut off point, though the dividing line between normal and elevated BP is lacking. Hypertension can be classified into primary, essential or idiopathic hypertension on one hand, and secondary one due to some disease itself. In treating hypertension, antihypertensives have their role, but attention may be directed towards some lifestyle modifications. As regarding dietary interventions, calorie restriction may influence the minimisation of BP. Body weight reduction, less alcohol consumption, salt restriction, potassium and calcium supplementation can enhance the process of lowering BP. The role of magnesium in hypertension is debatable. Serum cholesterol level is commonly elevated in hypertensive patients and its reduction reduces the risk of non-fatal coronary events. Diet rich in plant fibres either alone or with a low fat, low sodium could lower the BP by about 5 mm Hg in hypertensives. The omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids found in highest concentrations in cold water fishes have a modest antihypertensive effect. Caffeine contained in two cups of coffee may raise the BP by 5 mm Hg in infrequent users but in habitual users, caffeine has no role. Deficiency of vitamin C might lead to hypertension. As regarding behavioural changes, stopping smoking, regular physical exercise, relaxation therapies like yoga, etc, have definite beneficial effect on hypertensives. The antihypertensive effect of lifestyle modifications may obviate drug therapy. For this one or more of the lifestyle modifications should be tried initially in all hypertensive patients.

12008120	Validation of HPLC and GC-MS systems for bisphenol-A leached from hemodialyzers on the basis of FUMI theory.	This paper proposes a method for the validation of chromatography systems in which many experiments to estimate SD or RSD are difficult or impossible to carry out because of time, cost, etc. HPLC systems with UV-Vis and fluorescence detectors and GC-MS system for bisphenol-A leached from hemodialyzers are taken as an example. Examined as validation characteristics are not only the ordinary quantities (precision, accuracy, range, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantitation (LOQ), specificity and linearity) but also precision plots (measurement RSD vs. concentration), 95% confidence intervals of calibration lines and LOD signals over baselines. The precision plots, calibration confidence intervals and LOD signals are shown to be advantageous to validate and compare the analytical performance of the systems. The LOD, LOQ, precision plots and 95% confidence intervals of calibration lines are all derived from the SD of measurements and the reliability of these quantities and plots depends totally on the reliability of the SD estimates. This paper uses a probability theory, called the FUMI theory, to estimate as exact a measurement SD as possible without the replication. The precision of the HPLC and GC-MS systems is shown to coincide with the repeatability obtained by the repetition of measurements.

11993525	Conservative treatment options for carpal tunnel syndrome: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials.	Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common disorder, for which various conservative treatment options are available. The objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of the various conservative treatment options for relieving the symptoms of CTS. Computer-aided searches of MEDLINE (1/1966 to 3/2000), EMBASE (1/1988 to 2/2000) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (2000, issue 1) were conducted, together with reference checking. Included were randomised controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of conservative treatment options in a study population of CTS patients, with a full report published in English, German, French or Dutch. Two reviewers independently selected the studies. Fourteen randomised controlled trials were included in the review. Assessment of methodological quality and data-extraction was independently performed by two reviewers. A rating system, based on the number of studies and their methodological quality and findings, was used to determine the strength of the available evidence for the efficacy of the treatment. Diuretics, pyridoxine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, yoga and laser-acupuncture seem to be ineffective in providing short-term symptom relief (varying levels of evidence) and steroid injections seem to be effective (limited evidence). There is conflicting evidence for the efficacy of ultrasound and oral steroids. For providing long-term relief from symptoms there is limited evidence that ultrasound is effective, and that splinting is less effective than surgery. In conclusion, there is still little known about the efficacy of most conservative treatment options for CTS. To establish stronger evidence more high quality trials are needed.

11986540	Healing the heart: integrating complementary therapies and healing practices into the care of cardiovascular patients.	Complementary therapies and healing practices have been found to reduce stress, anxiety, and lifestyle patterns known to contribute to cardiovascular disease. Promising therapies include imagery and hypnosis, meditation, yoga, tai chi, prayer, music, exercise, diet, and use of dietary supplements. Many of these complementary approaches to healing have been within the domain of nursing for centuries and can readily be integrated into the care of patients with cardiovascular disease. While individual complimentary modalities hold considerable merit, it is critical that the philosophy underlying these therapies--caring, holism, and harmony--also be understood and honored.

11958969	Increased dopamine tone during meditation-induced change of consciousness.	This is the first in vivo demonstration of an association between endogenous neurotransmitter release and conscious experience. Using 11C-raclopride PET we demonstrated increased endogenous dopamine release in the ventral striatum during Yoga Nidra meditation. Yoga Nidra is characterized by a depressed level of desire for action, associated with decreased blood flow in prefrontal, cerebellar and subcortical regions, structures thought to be organized in open loops subserving executive control. In the striatum, dopamine modulates excitatory glutamatergic synapses of the projections from the frontal cortex to striatal neurons, which in turn project back to the frontal cortex via the pallidum and ventral thalamus. The present study was designed to investigate whether endogenous dopamine release increases during loss of executive control in meditation. Participants underwent two 11C-raclopride PET scans: one while attending to speech with eyes closed, and one during active meditation. The tracer competes with endogenous dopamine for access to dopamine D2 receptors predominantly found in the basal ganglia. During meditation, 11C-raclopride binding in ventral striatum decreased by 7.9%. This corresponds to a 65% increase in endogenous dopamine release. The reduced raclopride binding correlated significantly with a concomitant increase in EEG theta activity, a characteristic feature of meditation. All participants reported a decreased desire for action during meditation, along with heightened sensory imagery. The level of gratification and the depth of relaxation did not differ between the attention and meditation conditions. Here we show increased striatal dopamine release during meditation associated with the experience of reduced readiness for action. It is suggested that being in the conscious state of meditation causes a suppression of cortico-striatal glutamatergic transmission. To our knowledge this is the first time in vivo evidence has been provided for regulation of conscious states at a synaptic level.

11926432	Which complementary and alternative therapies benefit which conditions? A survey of the opinions of 223 professional organizations.	UNLABELLED: With the increasing demand and usage of complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) by the general public, it is vital that healthcare professionals can make informed decisions when advising or referring their patients who wish to use CAM. Therefore they might benefit from advice by CAM-providers as to which treatment can be recommended for which condition. AIM: The primary aim of this survey was to determine which complementary therapies are believed by their respective representing professional organizations to be suited for which medical conditions. METHOD: 223 questionnaires were sent out to CAM organizations representing a single CAM therapy. The respondents were asked to list the 15 conditions they felt benefited most from their CAM therapy, the 15 most important contra-indications, the typical costs of initial and any subsequent treatments and the average length of training required to become a fully qualified practitioner. The conditions and contra-indications quoted by responding CAM organizations were recorded and the top five of each were determined. Treatment costs and hours of training were expressed as ranges. RESULTS: Of the 223 questionnaires sent out, 66 were completed and returned. Taking undelivered questionnaires into account, the response rate was 34%. Two or more responses were received from CAM organizations representing twelve therapies: aromatherapy, Bach flower remedies, Bowen technique, chiropractic, homoeopathy, hypnotherapy, magnet therapy, massage, nutrition, reflexology, Reiki and yoga. The top seven common conditions deemed to benefit by all twelve therapies, in order of frequency, were: stress/anxiety, headaches/migraine, back pain, respiratory problems (including asthma), insomnia, cardiovascular problems and musculoskeletal problems. Aromatherapy, Bach flower remedies, hypnotherapy, massage, nutrition, reflexology, Reiki and yoga were all recommended as suitable treatments for stress/anxiety. Aromatherapy, Bowen technique, chiropractic, hypnotherapy, massage, nutrition, reflexology, Reiki and yoga were all recommended for headache/migraine. Bowen technique, chiropractic, magnet therapy, massage, reflexology and yoga were recommended for back pain. None of the therapies cost more than l60 for an initial consultation and treatment. No obvious correlation between length of training and treatment cost was apparent. CONCLUSION: The recommendations by CAM organizations responding to this survey may provide guidance to health care professionals wishing to advise or refer patients interested in using CAM.

11898219	The complex 'whole': exploring homoeopathic and spiritual considerations.	Unlike the biomedical model, holistic health care takes a much broader view of what constitutes health and the responsibility for helping restore an individual's health. Homoeopathy addresses the physical, mental and emotional aspects of the whole individual, while alternative practices such as yoga, hypnotherapy and meditation can be described as 'functional' spiritual practices which demonstrate the taking of personal responsibility for health care to the individual.

11892761	Disease prevention and health promotion in the aging with a traditional system of natural medicine: Maharishi Vedic Medicine.	OBJECTIVE: This review focuses on a comprehensive, sophisticated system of natural medicine that appears to hold promise for prevention of chronic diseases and disabilities, loss of independence, suffering, and health care costs often associated with "usual" aging. METHODS: The authors discuss the negative impact of usual aging on our society, with its rapidly growing percentage of elderly, and the challenge of promoting "successful aging." Emphasis is given to research literature suggesting that Maharishi Vedic Medicine (MVM) is particularly effective in retarding usual aging. RESULTS: Proposed mechanisms for the antiaging effects of MVM include reductions in physiological and psychological stress and enhancement of homeostatic and self-repair processes. CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that this set of innovative strategies may help society achieve recommended health objectives for disease prevention and health promotion in older adults and that widespread implementation of this self-empowering, prevention-oriented approach in the elderly is feasible, cost effective, and timely.

11883159	Effect of yogic practice on pulmonary functions in young females.	During recent years, a lot of research work has been done to show the beneficial effects of yoga training. The present study was undertaken to assess the effects of yogic practice on some pulmonary functions. Sixty healthy young female subjects (age group 17-28 yrs.) were selected. They had to do the yogic practices daily for about one hour. The observations were recorded by MEDSPIROR, in the form of FVC, FEV-1 and PEFR on day-1, after 6 weeks and 12 weeks of their yogic practice. There was significant increase in FVC, FEV-1 and PEFR at the end of 12 weeks.	Yadav, R K;Das, S	2001 Oct
11881576	Improvement in hand grip strength in normal volunteers and rheumatoid arthritis patients following yoga training.	The present study aimed at assessing the effects of a set of yoga practices on normal adults (n = 37), children (n = 86), and patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 20). An equal number of normal adults, children, and patients with rheumatoid arthritis who did not practice yoga were studied under each category, forming respective control groups. Yoga and control group subjects were assessed at baseline and after varying intervals, as follows, adults after 30 days, children after 10 days and patients after 15 days, based on the duration of the yoga program, which they attended, which was already fixed. Hand grip strength of both hands, measured with a grip dynamometer, increased in normal adults and children, and in rheumatoid arthritis patients, following yoga, but not in the corresponding control groups, showing no re-test effect. Adult female volunteers and patients showed a greater percentage improvement than corresponding adult males. This gender-based difference was not observed in children. Hence yoga practice improves hand grip strength in normal persons and in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, though the magnitude of improvement varies with factors such as gender and age.

11881575	Improved performance in the Tower of London test following yoga.	Twenty girls between 10 and 13 years of age, studying at a residential school were randomly assigned to two groups. One group practiced yoga for one hour fifteen minutes per day, 7 days a week, while the other group was given physical training for the same time. Time for planning and for execution and the number of moves required to complete the Tower of London task were assessed for both groups at the beginning and end of a month. These three assessments were separately tested in increasingly complex tasks requiring 2-moves, 4-moves and 5-moves. The pre-post data were compared using the Wilcoxon paired signed ranks test. The yoga group showed a significant reduction in planning time for both 2-moves and 4-moves tasks (53.9 and 59.1 percent respectively), execution time in both 4-moves and 5-moves tasks (63.7 and 60.3 percent respectively), and in the number of moves in the 4-moves tasks (20.9 percent). The physical training group showed no change. Hence yoga training for a month reduced the planning and execution time in simple (2-moves) as well as complex tasks (4, 5-moves) and facilitated reaching the target with a smaller number of moves in a complex task (4-moves).

11881567	Review of Prof. B.K. Anand's scientific study: fifty years following his discovery of feeding centre.	Prof. BK Anand the living legend, is the founder of modern neurophysiology in India. His career spanned an era that marks the beginning of Brain Research in India. His contributions to understanding of brain functions began with the epoch making discovery of lateral hypothalamic area as the 'feeding center'. Subsequently it encompasses a wider range of studies from elucidation of the intricate mechanisms underlying ingestive behaviour to hypothalamic regulation of cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal activity and regulation of various physiological functions by limbic system. The following review gives an account of the contributions made by Prof Anand and his colleagues during twenty five years of his illustrious career. The publications resulted from his studies has not only stood as a testimony to understanding of the neural control of ingestive behaviour and limbic functions but also have been a sources of a great interest to those who pursue knowledge in this field.

11832673	Effects of Hatha Yoga Practice on the Health-Related Aspects of Physical Fitness.	Ten healthy, untrained volunteers (nine females and one male), ranging in age from 18-27 years, were studied to determine the effects of hatha yoga practice on the health-related aspects of physical fitness, including muscular strength and endurance, flexibility, cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition, and pulmonary function. Subjects were required to attend a minimum of two yoga classes per week for a total of 8 weeks. Each yoga session consisted of 10 minutes of pranayamas (breath-control exercises), 15 minutes of dynamic warm-up exercises, 50 minutes of asanas (yoga postures), and 10 minutes of supine relaxation in savasana (corpse pose). The subjects were evaluated before and after the 8-week training program. Isokinetic muscular strength for elbow extension, elbow flexion, and knee extension increased by 31%, 19%, and 28% (p<0.05), respectively, whereas isometric muscular endurance for knee flexion increased 57% (p<0.01). Ankle flexibility, shoulder elevation, trunk extension, and trunk flexion increased by 13% (p<0.01), 155% (p<0.001), 188% (p<0.001), and 14% (p<0.05), respectively. Absolute and relative maximal oxygen uptake increased by 7% and 6%, respectively (p<0.01). These findings indicate that regular hatha yoga practice can elicit improvements in the health-related aspects of physical fitness. (c)2001 CHF, Inc.

11828038	Sahaja yoga in the management of moderate to severe asthma: a randomised controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Sahaja Yoga is a traditional system of meditation based on yogic principles which may be used for therapeutic purposes. A study was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of this therapy as an adjunctive tool in the management of asthma in adult patients who remained symptomatic on moderate to high doses of inhaled steroids. METHODS: A parallel group, double blind, randomised controlled trial was conducted. Subjects were randomly allocated to Sahaja yoga and control intervention groups. Both the yoga and the control interventions required the subjects to attend a 2 hour session once a week for 4 months. Asthma related quality of life (AQLQ, range 0-4), Profile of Mood States (POMS), level of airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine (AHR), and a diary card based combined asthma score (CAS, range 0-12) reflecting symptoms, bronchodilator usage, and peak expiratory flow rates were measured at the end of the treatment period and again 2 months later. RESULTS: Twenty one of 30 subjects randomised to the yoga intervention and 26 of 29 subjects randomised to the control group were available for assessment at the end of treatment. The improvement in AHR at the end of treatment was 1.5 doubling doses (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.0 to 2.9, p=0.047) greater in the yoga intervention group than in the control group. Differences in AQLQ score (0.41, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.86) and CAS (0.9, 95% CI -0.9 to 2.7) were not significant (p>0.05). The AQLQ mood subscale did improve more in the yoga group than in the control group (difference 0.63, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.20), as did the summary POMS score (difference 18.4, 95% CI 0.2 to 36.5, p=0.05). There were no significant differences between the two groups at the 2 month follow up assessment. CONCLUSIONS: This randomised controlled trial has shown that the practice of Sahaja yoga does have limited beneficial effects on some objective and subjective measures of the impact of asthma. Further work is required to understand the mechanism underlying the observed effects and to establish whether elements of this intervention may be clinically valuable in patients with severe asthma.

11822614	Use of complementary and alternative medicine among women in New York City: a pilot study.	OBJECTIVE: This study documents the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), among White, African American, and Hispanic/Latina women living in New York City. A pilot to a national survey of CAM use among American women, this study explores women's use of categories of CAM and various CAM practitioners, racial and ethnic differences in CAM use, and women's perceptions regarding the effectiveness of CAM. DESIGN AND LOCATION: Data were collected from women residing in New York City using random digit dialing/computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). The sample of 300 had equal numbers of women (n = 100) who self-identified as White, Hispanic/Latina, and African American, equally stratified by age (below and above age 40). SUBJECTS: Eligibility requirements included self-identification as Anglo/white, African American, or Hispanic/Latina and between ages 18 and 80. MEASURES: Three distinct categories of CAM were explored: (1) medicinal teas, homeopathic remedies, herbs, vitamins; (2) yoga, meditation, spiritual practices; and (3) manual therapies including chiropractic, massage, acupressure. Health concerns of interest were those frequently described in prior focus groups, and included reproductive health issues (e.g., pregnancy, menstruation, menopause) as well as other common women's health problems (e.g., heart disease, high blood pressure, headaches). RESULTS: More than half the sample has used a CAM treatment or remedy, and 40% have visited a CAM practitioner. Among users, half have used only one of the CAM categories, approximately one third have used two, and 16% used all three. The category of CAM used most often was medicinal tea/herbs/vitamins; the practitioners visited most frequently were chiropractors (18%) and nutritionists (17%). Racial and ethnic differences in CAM use were minimal, and approximately one third of all treatments used were rated "very effective" by users. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial utilization of CAM remedies and treatments for a variety of women's health concerns is observed. Further inquiry with larger samples of women is recommended.

11816777	Complementary and alternative medicine: what's it all about?	A number of health-related interventions--from widespread therapies such as acupuncture, herbal medicine, homeopathy and yoga, to less well-known modalities such as Feldenkrais, iridology, reflexology and reiki--have increasingly come under the general heading of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). A few, such as biofeedback, chiropractic and physical therapy, are considered conventional by some, alternative by others. Several national surveys estimate that around 40% of the US populace uses a CAM therapy in a given year. While a few people use CAM therapies instead of conventional medicine, the vast majority of CAM users continue to access the official health care system. Many, however, do not discuss their CAM use with their physician. Medical doctors, for their part, are sharply divided on their attitudes toward CAM, with strong advocates and vehement opponents writing and speaking about this issue. CAM therapists are even more diverse, spanning the spectrum from conventional-appearing registered and certified practitioners to iconoclasts promoting anomalous therapies in the place of conventional treatment. The majority, however, both respect and want to work with conventional medicine, as do their patients. Nearly everyone is calling for more and better evidence, and an ever-increasing number of randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses are now appearing in the literature. Over the past few years, a number of calls for "integrated medicine" have been made, and a few attempts at integrating CAM and conventional medicine have been launched. This article reviews these issues, citing our own interview-based work and the relevant literature. Whether the CAM phenomenon represents a short-lived social movement or the beginnings of a radical transformation of medicine has yet to be determined.	Barrett, B	2001
11795623	Mindfulness-based stress reduction and healthcare utilization in the inner city: preliminary findings.	CONTEXT: Research on mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has focused on measuring symptom reduction in middle-class and working-class populations. The present study examined inner-city patients' healthcare utilization before and after an MBSR intervention. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether completion of an MBSR program resulted in changes in healthcare utilization in an inner-city population. DESIGN: Medical chart review compared the number and diagnoses of health center visits during the year before patients entered the MBSR program with the year following completion of the program. SETTING: The Community Health Center in Meriden, Conn. PATIENTS: The chart review process examined healthcare utilization patterns for 73 patients: 54 who completed the MBSR program in Spanish and 19 who completed the program in English. The focus of this study is a subgroup of 47 patients for whom a complete year of data were available before and after the intervention. INTERVENTION: An 8-week course in MBSR. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The number and diagnoses of patients' health center visits before and after completion of the MBSR program. RESULTS: A significant decrease in the number of chronic care visits was found among the 47 patients for whom complete data were available. The 36 patients who completed the Spanish courses demonstrated a significant decrease in total medical visits and chronic care visits. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that MBSR may help contain healthcare costs by decreasing the number of visits made by inner-city patients to their primary care providers after completing the MBSR program.

11751348	Effect of rosary prayer and yoga mantras on autonomic cardiovascular rhythms: comparative study.	OBJECTIVE: To test whether rhythmic formulas such as the rosary and yoga mantras can synchronise and reinforce inherent cardiovascular rhythms and modify baroreflex sensitivity. DESIGN: Comparison of effects of recitation of the Ave Maria (in Latin) or of a mantra, during spontaneous and metronome controlled breathing, on breathing rate and on spontaneous oscillations in RR interval, and on blood pressure and cerebral circulation. SETTING: Florence and Pavia, Italy. PARTICIPANTS: 23 healthy adults. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Breathing rate, regularity of breathing, baroreflex sensitivity, frequency of cardiovascular oscillations. RESULTS: Both prayer and mantra caused striking, powerful, and synchronous increases in existing cardiovascular rhythms when recited six times a minute. Baroreflex sensitivity also increased significantly, from 9.5 (SD 4.6) to 11.5 (4.9) ms/mm Hg, P<0.05. CONCLUSION: Rhythm formulas that involve breathing at six breaths per minute induce favourable psychological and possibly physiological effects.

11745596	Progressive muscle relaxation, breathing exercises, and ABC relaxation theory.	This study compared the psychological effects of Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) and breathing exercises. Forty-two students were divided randomly into two groups and taught PMR or breathing exercises. Both groups practiced for five weeks and were given the Smith Relaxation States Inventory before and after each session. As hypothesized, PMR practitioners displayed greater increments in relaxation states (R-States) Physical Relaxation and Disengagement, while breathing practitioners displayed higher levels of R-State Strength and Awareness. Slight differences emerged at Weeks 1 and 2; major differences emerged at Weeks 4 and 5. A delayed and potentially reinforcing aftereffect emerged for PMR only after five weeks of training--increased levels of Mental Quiet and Joy. Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed.

11707708	Whiplash injury determination with conventional spine imaging and cryomicrotomy.	STUDY DESIGN: Soft tissue-related injuries to the cervical spine structures were produced by use of intact entire human cadavers undergoing rear-end impacts. Radiography, computed tomography, and cryomicrotomy techniques were used to evaluate the injury. OBJECTIVES: To replicate soft tissue injuries resulting from single input of whiplash acceleration to whole human cadavers simulating vehicular rear impacts, and to assess the ability of different modes of imaging to visualize soft tissue cervical lesions. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Whiplash-associated disorders such as headache and neck pain are implicated with soft tissue abnormalities to structures of the cervical spine. To the authors' best knowledge, no previous studies have been conducted to determine whether single cycle whiplash acceleration input to intact entire human cadavers can result in these soft tissue alterations. There is also a scarcity of data on the efficacy of radiography and computed tomography in assessing these injuries. METHODS: Four intact entire human cadavers underwent single whiplash acceleration (3.3 g or 4.5 g) loading by use of a whole-body sled. Pretest and posttest radiographs, computed tomography images, and sequential anatomic sections using a cryomicrotome were obtained to determine the extent of trauma to the cervical spine structures. RESULTS: Routine radiography identified the least number of lesions (one lesion in two specimens). Although computed tomography was more effective (three lesions in two specimens), trauma was not readily apparent to all soft tissues of the cervical spine. Cryomicrotome sections identified structural alterations in all four specimens to lower cervical spine components that included stretch and tear of the ligamentum flavum, anulus disruption, anterior longitudinal ligament rupture, and zygopophysial joint compromise with tear of the capsular ligaments. CONCLUSIONS: These results clearly indicate that a single application of whiplash acceleration pulse can induce soft tissue-related and ligament-related alterations to cervical spine structures. The pathologic changes identified in this study support previous observations from human volunteers observations with regard to the location of whiplash injury and may assist in the explanation of pain arising from this injury. Although computed tomography is a better imaging modality than radiography, subtle but clinically relevant injuries may be left undiagnosed with this technique. The cryomicrotome technique offers a unique procedure to understand and compare soft tissue-related injuries to the cervical anatomy caused by whiplash loading. Recognition of these injuries may advance the general knowledge of the whiplash disorder.	Yoganandan, N;Cusick, J F;Pintar, F A;Rao, R D	2001 Nov 15
11573025	Gender differences in psychophysiological responses to speech stress among older social phobics:: congruence and incongruence between self-evaluative and cardiovascular reactions.	OBJECTIVE: Evidence suggests increased cardiovascular risk and autonomic impairment among individuals with chronic anxiety. Little attention, however, has been paid to the anxiety disorder of social phobia despite its high prevalence. Additionally, gender- and age-related cardiovascular profiles have not been examined in relation to social phobia. This study investigated cardiovascular responses to a socially threatening situation among older men and women with social phobia and control subjects. METHODS: Thirty subjects with social phobia and 30 control subjects (mean age = 65 years) were assessed during baseline, paced breathing, speech preparation, and speech presentation. Electrocardiographic variables, blood pressure, respiration, and emotional state (self-reported) were monitored. Hemodynamic variables included heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance; autonomic measures were respiratory sinus arrhythmia and baroreflex sensitivity, both markers of cardiac vagal control, and 0.10-Hz systolic blood pressure variability, an index of sympathetic vasomotor tone. RESULTS: Subjects with social phobia, in contrast to nonanxious control subjects, manifested more anxiety, embarrassment, and somatic complaints in response to stress; however, physiological measures generally did not distinguish groups. Interaction effects indicated that socially phobic women were hyperresponsive to the stressor with respect to self-reported, hemodynamic, and autonomic parameters. Socially phobic men manifested no physiological differences in comparison with control subjects, but they reported more psychological and somatic complaints. CONCLUSIONS: Gender differences in subjective and physiological responses to a socially threatening situation indicate congruence between perceived social anxiety and physiological responses in older women but not men. We found no evidence of impaired cardiovascular autonomic regulation among socially phobic men despite other reports that phobically anxious men are at greater cardiovascular risk.

11530720	Relaxation therapy in adult asthma. Is there new evidence for its effectiveness?	Studies of relaxation training for adult asthma patients were reviewed for the period between 1980 and 2000. Six controlled and three uncontrolled studies were identified, employing a variety of methods, such as progressive relaxation, functional relaxation, autogenic training, or yoga. Most studies had low sample sizes and suffered from one or more methodological deficiencies, such as suboptimal data analysis, high dropout rates, problematic measurement procedures, or insufficient descriptions of methodology and results. Overall effects on parameters of lung function, symptoms, medication consumption, and health care use were generally negligible. Problems with the underlying rationale of relaxation therapy in asthma are discussed from a psychophysiological viewpoint. Examples are given of potential beneficial and detrimental effects of these techniques on lung function with respect to emotional processes, the musculoskeletal system, and ventilation as targets of a relaxation intervention. It remains to be demonstrated that relaxation training can significantly contribute to the standard treatment of asthma in adult patients.	Ritz, T	2001 Sep
11524157	Human anterior and frontal midline theta and lower alpha reflect emotionally positive state and internalized attention: high-resolution EEG investigation of meditation.	EEG spectral power and coherence estimates in the individually defined delta, theta, alpha-1, alpha-2, and alpha-3 bands were used to identify and characterize brain regions involved in meditative states, in which focused internalized attention gives rise to emotionally positive "blissful" experience. Blissful state was accompanied by increased anterior frontal and midline theta synchronization as well as enhanced theta long-distant connectivity between prefrontal and posterior association cortex with distinct "center of gravity" in the left prefrontal region (AF3 site). Subjective scores of emotional experience significantly correlated with theta, whereas scores of internalized attention with both theta and alpha lower synchronization. Our results propose selective associations of theta and alpha oscillating networks activity with states of internalized attention and positive emotional experience.

11480165	The physiological correlates of Kundalini Yoga meditation: a study of a yoga master.	This study explores the physiological correlates of a highly practiced Kundalini Yoga meditator. Thoracic and abdominal breathing patterns, heart rate (HR), occipital parietal electroencephalograph (EEG), skin conductance level (SCL), and blood volume pulse (BVP) were monitored during prebaseline, meditation, and postbaseline periods. Visual analyses of the data showed a decrease in respiration rate during the meditation from a mean of 11 breaths/min for the pre- and 13 breaths/min for the postbaseline to a mean of 5 breaths/min during the meditation, with a predominance of abdominal/diaphragmatic breathing. There was also more alpha EEG activity during the meditation (M = 1.71 microV) compared to the pre- (M = .47 microV) and postbaseline (M = .78 microV) periods, and an increase in theta EEG activity immediately following the meditation (M = .62 microV) compared to the pre-baseline and meditative periods (each with M = .26 microV). These findings suggest that a shift in breathing patterns may contribute to the development of alpha EEG, and those patterns need to be investigated further.

23105323	A preliminary report on the role of yoga asanas on oxidative stress in non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.	Nineteen subjects of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) between the age group of 30-60 yrs were studied to see the effect of specific yoga asanas on fasting and postprandial blood glucose (FBG, PPG), serum malondialdehyde (MDA) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1)) in addition to drug treatment and diet control. The duration of diabetes ranged from 1-10 years. Patients with renal, cardiac and proliferative retinal diseases were excluded from the study. The same patients served as their own control. Subjects were called in the morning to the cardio-respiratory laboratory and were given training by a yoga expert. Yoga asanas included Suryanamskar, Tadasan, TriKonasan, Padmasan, Pranayam, Paschimottanasan, Ardhmatsyendrasan, Pavanmukthasan, Sarpasan and Shavasan. The asanas were done every day for 40 days for 30-40 min. FBG, PPG, serum MDA and HbA(1) were estimated before and after 40 days of yoga asanas regimen. Significant reduction was seen in FBG from 220 mg/dl to 162 mg/dl, PPG from 311 mg/dl to 255 mg/dl, MDA from 6 nmol/l to 3 nmol/l and HbA(1), from 8.8% to 6.4%. Subjects felt better and were relieved of their stresses and had an improvement in their day to day performance. The decrease was statistically significant (p<0.0001 for FBG and PPG, p<0.001 for MDA and for HbA(1)).	Singh, S;Malhotra, V;Singh, K P;Sharma, S B;Madhu, S V;Tandon, O P	2001 Jul
11424777	[Evaluation of the peripartum effects of 2 analgesics: meperidine and tramadol, used in labor].	The need for analgesia to overcome pain in labour is highly requested by women today. Various ways either non pharmachologic e.g. Emotional sustain, psycho-prophylactic preparation, yoga and hypnosis or pharmachologic such as epidural blockade or parenteral are used. Therefore in our study we evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of the two opioids usually used today in parenteral analgesia to reduce pain during labour: Tramadol and Meperidine. We studied two groups of patients each made up of 20 women in labour, all at term and with a physiologic course of pregnancy. 75 mg i.m. of Meperidine chloryhydrate were somministered in the first group while in the second group 100 mg i.m. of tramadol chloryhydrate were somministered. Various maternal, fetal and neonatal parameters were then monitored demonstrating--A moderate maternal analgesic effect in both drugs (evaluated through the analogic grading of pain). In the group to whom Meperidine was given, sedative effects on the mother were observed associated with respiratory depression in the newborn (the latter evaluated through the Apgar index at 1st and 5th minute of life and pH of the blood obtained at the umbilical cord. The data obtained permitted us to conclude that Tramadol in accordance to the obtained in literature gives an analogous analgesic effect, with better tolerability for the absence of collateral effects on the mother, fetus and newborn.

11393679	Breathing patterns and cardiovascular autonomic modulation during hypoxia induced by simulated altitude.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the influence of different breathing patterns on autonomic cardiovascular modulation during acute exposure to altitude-induced hypoxia. DESIGN: We measured relative changes in minute ventilation (VE), oxygen saturation (%SaO2), spectral analysis of RR interval and blood pressure, and response to stimulation of carotid baroreceptors (neck suction) at baseline and after acute (1 h) hypobaric hypoxia (equivalent to 5,000 m, in a hypobaric chamber). METHODS: We studied 19 human subjects: nine controls and 10 Western yoga trainees of similar age, while breathing spontaneously, at 15 breaths/min (controlled breathing) and during 'complete yogic breathing' (slow diaphragmatic + thoracic breathing, approximately 5 breaths/min) in yoga trainees, or simple slow breathing in controls. RESULTS: At baseline %SaO2, VE and autonomic pattern were similar in both groups; simulated altitude increased VE in controls but not in yoga trainees; %SaO2 decreased in all subjects (P< 0.0001), but more in controls than in yoga trainees (17 versus 12%, 14 versus 9%, 14 versus 8%, all P< 0.05 or better, during spontaneous breathing, controlled breathing and yogic or slow breathing, respectively). Simulated altitude decreased RR interval (from 879 +/- 45 to 770 +/- 39, P < 0.01) and increased indices deducted from spectral analysis of heart rate variability (low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) ratio from 1.6 +/- 0.5 to 3.2 +/- 1.1, P < 0.05) and systolic blood pressure (low-frequency fluctuations from 2.30 +/- 0.31 to 3.07 +/- 0.24 In-mmHg2, P< 0.05) in controls, indicating sympathetic activation; these changes were blunted in yoga trainees, and in both groups during slow or yogic breathing. No effect of altitude was seen on stimulation of carotid baroreceptors in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Well-performed slow yogic breathing maintains better blood oxygenation without increasing VE (i.e. seems to be a more efficient breathing) and reduces sympathetic activation during altitude-induced hypoxia.

11273502	Retardation of coronary atherosclerosis with yoga lifestyle intervention.	BACKGROUND: Yoga has potential for benefit for patients with coronary artery disease though objective, angiographic studies are lacking. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated possible role of lifestyle modification incorporating yoga, on retardation of coronary atherosclerotic disease. In this prospective, randomized, controlled trial, 42 men with angiographically proven coronary artery disease (CAD) were randomized to control (n = 21) and yoga intervention group (n = 21) and were followed for one year. The active group was treated with a user-friendly program consisting of yoga, control of risk factors, diet control and moderate aerobic exercise. The control group was managed by conventional methods i.e. risk factor control and American Heart Association step I diet. RESULTS: At one year, the yoga groups showed significant reduction in number of anginal episodes per week, improved exercise capacity and decrease in body weight. Serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels also showed greater reductions as compared with control group. Revascularisation procedures (coronary angioplasty or bypass surgery) were less frequently required in the yoga group (one versus eight patients; relative risk = 5.45; P = 0.01). Coronary angiography repeated at one year showed that significantly more lesions regressed (20% versus 2%) and less lesions progressed (5% versus 37%) in the yoga group (chi-square = 24.9; P < 0.0001). The compliance to the total program was excellent and no side effects were observed. CONCLUSION: Yoga lifestyle intervention retards progression and increases regression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with severe coronary artery disease. It also improves symptomatic status, functional class and risk factor profile.	Manchanda, S C;Narang, R;Reddy, K S;Sachdeva, U;Prabhakaran, D;Dharmanand, S;Rajani, M;Bijlani, R	2000 Jul
11273114	Yoga therapy in chronic bronchitis.	Fifteen patients of chronic bronchitis received yoga therapy in the form of pranayam and 8 types of 'asans' for a period of 4 weeks. They had a perceptible improvement in dyspnoea as was measured by visual analog. Lung function parameters (VC, FEV1, and PEFR) also improved after the practice of yoga. This preliminary study indicates that, yoga may be an useful adjunct to other conventional form of therapy for COPD.	Behera, D	1998 Feb

Use of a variety of therapies and techniques--ranging from acupuncture to yoga to herbal therapies--that are designed to relieve medical conditions and illnesses and/or emphasize the mind, body, and spirit connections are gaining popularity among patients in the United States. For years, many hospitals, plans, clinicians, and insurers ignored these therapies when using "conventional" therapies.

11268398	Oncology in neuroimmunomodulation. What progress has been made?	In 1987 in Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia, N.H. Spector named a new discipline: Neuroimmunomodulation. R. Ader called this new discipline psychoneuroimmunomodulation when the major emphysis was on its behavioral aspects. Neuroimmunomodulation (NIM) is devoted to the study of the interactions at different morphologic and functional levels among the immune, nervous, and endocrine systems. In fact, this science is the modern manifestation of an old science: in the words of B.D. Jankovic (1987), "Neuroimmunomodulation is a modern reflection in neurosciences and immunosciences of the ideas and experience of philosophers and ingenious observers of ancient Egypt, Greece, China, India, and other civilizations that the mind is involved in the defense against diseases." Twelve years ago NIM was regarded by many conventional scientists almost as a form of witchcraft. Today it may be the fastest growing area of biomedical science research in the world. Important clinical applications will not be far behind. NIM research has also progressed in the field of oncology research. Topics such as treatment of hormone-dependent cancer with analogues of hypothalamic hormones, the role of opioids and T cells in cancer, stress-cancer-immune connections, the anticancer role of melatonin and cytokines, immunotherapy of cancer, and the role of psychotherapy in cancer patients represent some lines of research that have been or are being investigated by scientists. Some areas remain to be thoroughly investigated such as the influence of physical exercise (sports), music (classical or modern), and/or relaxation techniques (e.g. yoga) on the development of human cancer. This paper reviews the role of NIM in oncology and provides some perspectives for further research and development of clinical applications.	Conti, A	2000

11246939	Emerging paradigms in mind-body medicine.	The emerging paradigms in medicine can be seen through mind-body interactions. Observations in many meditative traditions suggest a series of objective indicators of health beyond absence of disease. Several of the physical signs have been confirmed by research or are consistent with modern science. Further correlation with long term health outcome is needed. Integration of meditation with conventional therapy has enriched psychotherapy with parallels drawn between the Nine Step Qigong and Freudian developmental psychology. A unified theory of the chakra system and the meridian system widely used in traditional mind-body interventions and acupuncture is presented in terms of modern science based on the morphogenetic singularity theory. Acupuncture points originate from the organizing centers in morphogenesis. Meridians and chakras are related to the underdifferentiated, interconnected cellular network that regulates growth and physiology. This theory explains the distribution and nonspecific activation of organizing centers and acupuncture points; the high electric conductance of the meridian system; the polarity effect of electroacupuncture; the side-effect profile of acupuncture; and the ontogeny, phylogeny, and physiologic function of the meridian system and chakra system. It also successfully predicted several findings in conventional biomedical science. These advances have implications in many disciplines of medicine.	Shang, C	2001 Feb

11229124	The role of cough and hyperventilation in perpetuating airway inflammation in asthma.	Air flowing through a pipe exerts frictional stress on the walls of the pipe. Frictional stress of more than 40 N/m2 (velocity equivalent of air 113 m/s) is known to cause acute endothelial damage in blood vessels. The frictional stress in airways during coughing may be much greater, however, since the velocity of air may be as high as speed of sound in air. We suggest that high levels of frictional stress perpetuate airway inflammation in airways which are already inflamed and vulnerable to frictional stress-induced trauma in patients with asthma. Activities associated with rapid ventilation and higher frictional stress (e.g. exercise, hyperventilation, coughing, sneezing and laughing) cause asthma to worsen whilst activities that reduce frictional stress (Yoga 'Pranayama', breathing a helium-oxygen mixture and nasal continuous positive airway pressure) are beneficial. Therefore control of cough may have anti-inflammatory benefits in patients with asthma.	Singh, V;Chowdhary, R;Chowdhary, N	2000 Mar
11218923	Oxygen consumption and respiration following two yoga relaxation techniques.	The present study was conducted to evaluate a statement in ancient yoga texts that suggests that a combination of both "calming" and "stimulating" measures may be especially helpful in reaching a state of mental equilibrium. Two yoga practices, one combining "calming and stimulating" measures (cyclic meditation) and the other, a "calming" technique (shavasan), were compared. The oxygen consumption, breath rate, and breath volume of 40 male volunteers (group mean +/- SD, 27.0 +/- 5.7 years) were assessed before and after sessions of cyclic meditation (CM) and before and after sessions of shavasan (SH). The 2 sessions (CM, SH) were 1 day apart. Cyclic meditation includes the practice of yoga postures interspersed with periods of supine relaxation. During SH the subject lies in a supine position throughout the practice. There was a significant decrease in the amount of oxygen consumed and in breath rate and an increase in breath volume after both types of sessions (2-factor ANOVA, paired t test). However, the magnitude of change on all 3 measures was greater after CM: (1) Oxygen consumption decreased 32.1% after CM compared with 10.1% after SH; (2) breath rate decreased 18.0% after CM and 15.2% after SH; and (3) breath volume increased 28.8% after CM and 15.9% after SH. These results support the idea that a combination of yoga postures interspersed with relaxation reduces arousal more than relaxation alone does.	Telles, S;Reddy, S K;Nagendra, H R	2000 Dec
11214505	Minimum muscular fitness in school children.	Two hundred and fifty school boys from Lonavla were randomly selected and tested with Kraus-Weber tests for their minimum muscular fitness. The results revealed that 20.8 per cent boys failed in the tests. Multiple failures were 4.8 percent while flexibility failures alone were 11.6 percent. Boys at the age of 15 years failed more in flexibility test. Boys at the age of 10 years had the maximum percentage of failures to the extent of 38.5. Inclusion of Yogasanas in the programme of physical activities of the school is suggested for the improvement of the status of the failures.	Gharote, M M	2000 Oct
11214493	Cardiovascular responses to head-down-body-up postural exercise (Sarvangasana).	Sarvangasana (SVGN) is a head-down-body-up postural exercise in a 'negative g' condition. Though highly recommended as one of the three best of all the asanas it has not yet been studied for its very obvious effects on the cardiovascular (CV) functions. This paper reports the results of the first systematic investigation on SVGN employing echocardiographic analysis in eight healthy male subjects before and after a practice of this asana twice daily for two weeks. The resting heart rate (HR) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) were significantly reduced (P < 0.02, P < 0.01 respectively) after practising this asana. A tendency toward a mild regression of the left ventricular mass was noticed, though it was not statistically significant. The CV responses to acute 45 degrees head-down tilt (HDT) in a tilt table was not altered after practising this asana. Also there was no orthostatic intolerance during the 3-5 min period of 70 degrees head-up tilt (HUT). These results strongly indicate that further studies of this asana performed for a longer period is most likely to yield very significant observations of applied value.

11211575	Efficacy of naturopathy and yoga in bronchial asthma--a self controlled matched scientific study.	Asthma is one of the common psychosomatic illness influenced by many factors. Bronchodilators give temporary relief and have side effects. The present study is aimed at finding the efficacy of a non-pharmacological approach of naturopathy and Yoga in bronchial asthma. A total no of 37 patients (19 men, 18 women) with mean age 35.06 yrs (men), 40.74 yrs (women) admitted to INYS, Bangalore, for the period of 21 days. The treatment included 1. Diet therapy 2. Nature cure treatment and 3. Yoga therapy. The various parameters including lung function test were measured on admission and once a week. Results showed the significant improvement in PEFR, VC, FVC, FEV1, FEV/FEC %, MVV, ESR and absolute eosinophil count. The patients reported a feeling of well being, freshness and comfortable breathing. Naturopathy and yoga helps in inducing positive health, alleviating the symptoms of disease by acting at physical and mental levels.	Sathyaprabha, T N;Murthy, H;Murthy, B T	2001 Jan
11211570	Effect of yogic exercises on physical and mental health of young fellowship course trainees.	A study was undertaken to observe any beneficial effect of yogic practices during training period on the young trainees. 54 trainees of 20-25 years age group were divided randomly in two groups i.e. yoga and control group. Yoga group (23 males and 5 females) was administered yogic practices for the first five months of the course while control group (21 males and 5 females) did not perform yogic exercises during this period. From the 6th to 10th month of training both the groups performed the yogic practices. Physiological parameters like heart rate, blood pressure, oral temperature, skin temperature in resting condition, responses to maximal and submaximal exercise, body flexibility were recorded. Psychological parameters like personality, learning, arithmetic and psychomotor ability, mental well being were also recorded. Various parameters were taken before and during the 5th and 10th month of training period. Initially there was relatively higher sympathetic activity in both the groups due to the new work/training environment but gradually it subsided. Later on at the 5th and 10th month, yoga group had relatively lower sympathetic activity than the control group. There was improvement in performance at submaximal level of exercise and in anaerobic threshold in the yoga group. Shoulder, hip, trunk and neck flexibility improved in the yoga group. There was improvement in various psychological parameters like reduction in anxiety and depression and a better mental function after yogic practices.

11198952	Evaluating complementary and alternative therapies for cancer patients.	"Complementary and alternative" therapies are actually a vast collection of disparate, unrelated regimens and products, ranging from adjunctive modalities that effectively enhance quality of life and promising antitumor herbal remedies now under investigation, to bogus therapies that claim to cure cancer and that harm not only directly, but also indirectly by encouraging patients to avoid or postpone effective cancer care. Complementary therapies such as music and massage, herbal teas to aid digestion and relieve nausea, yoga, tai chi, meditation, and the many other well-documented techniques that relieve stress and enhance well-being should be made available to patients to augment and ease the experience of cancer treatment and recovery. Many time-tested herbal and diet-based remedies are now being studied for their abilities to induce or extend remission without toxicity. At the same time, lack of government regulatory authority leaves consumers at the mercy of those who promote unproved remedies, scores of which the grocery store and pharmacy shelves. Many of these over-the-counter products contain harmful ingredients. Herb-drug interactions, only some of which are documented, occur with frequency and are sufficiently problematic to require that patients stop taking herbal remedies prior to surgery (to prevent interactions with anesthetics and anticoagulant effects); before radiation (due to potential for increased photosensitivity); and during courses of chemotherapy (to prevent product-drug interactions). Moreover, both good information and misinformation that appear in printed materials and on the Internet appeal to better educated consumers, who are, in fact, the most likely to try complementary and alternative methods.

11207455	The etiologies, pathophysiology, and alternative/complementary treatment of asthma.	A chronic inflammatory disorder of the respiratory airways, asthma is characterized by bronchial airway inflammation resulting in increased mucus production and airway hyper-responsiveness. The resultant symptomatology includes episodes of wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. Asthma is a multifactorial disease process with genetic, allergic, environmental, infectious, emotional, and nutritional components. The underlying pathophysiology of asthma is airway inflammation. The underlying process driving and maintaining the asthmatic inflammatory process appears to be an abnormal or inadequately regulated CD4+ T-cell immune response. The T-helper 2 (Th2) subset produces cytokines including interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-13, which stimulate the growth, differentiation, and recruitment of mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, and B-cells, all of which are involved in humoral immunity, inflammation, and the allergic response. In asthma, this arm of the immune response is overactive, while Th1 activity, generally corresponding more to cell-mediated immunity, is dampened. It is not yet known why asthmatics have this out-of-balance immune activity, but genetics, viruses, fungi, heavy metals, nutrition, and pollution all can be contributors. A plant lipid preparation containing sterols and sterolins has been shown to dampen Th2 activity. Antioxidant nutrients, especially vitamins C and E, selenium, and zinc appear to be necessary in asthma treatment. Vitamins B6 and B12 also may be helpful. Omega-3 fatty acids from fish, the flavonoid quercetin, and botanicals Tylophora asthmatica, Boswellia serrata and Petasites hybridus address the inflammatory component. Physical modalities, including yoga, massage, biofeedback, acupuncture, and chiropractic can also be of help.	Miller, A L	2001 Feb
11181093	Yoga for control of epilepsy.	Yoga is an age-old traditional Indian psycho-philosophical-cultural method of leading one's life, that alleviates stress, induces relaxation and provides multiple health benefits to the person following its system. It is a method of controlling the mind through the union of an individual's dormant energy with the universal energy. Commonly practiced yoga methods are 'Pranayama' (controlled deep breathing), 'Asanas' (physical postures) and 'Dhyana' (meditation) admixed in varying proportions with differing philosophic ideas. A review of yoga in relation to epilepsy encompasses not only seizure control but also many factors dealing with overall quality-of-life issues (QOL). This paper reviews articles related to yoga and epilepsy, seizures, EEG, autonomic changes, neuro-psychology, limbic system, arousal, sleep, brain plasticity, motor performance, brain imaging studies, and rehabilitation. There is a dearth of randomized, blinded, controlled studies related to yoga and seizure control. A multi-centre, cross-cultural, preferably blinded (difficult for yoga), well-randomized controlled trial, especially using a single yogic technique in a homogeneous population such as Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is justified to find out how yoga affects seizure control and QOL of the person with epilepsy.

11140067	Invest in yourself. Yoga as a self-care strategy.	A widening recognition of the mind-body-spirit connection in western medicine has resulted in a growing interest in ancient health practices such as yoga. As complementary therapies enter mainstream medical settings, nurses and other healthcare providers need a fundamental understanding of these modalities to be able to advise patients effectively. This article provides an overview of yoga and details the benefits of yoga practice.	Herrick, C M;Ainsworth, A D	2000 Apr-Jun
11122977	Therapeutic approaches to the treatment of refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder.	Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a debilitating condition that afflicts approximately 1% to 3% of the world population. The primary treatments are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and behavioral therapy. Despite therapy, approximately 30% to 40% of patients continue to suffer from disabling OCD symptoms. This article addresses the range of treatment options for patients with refractory OCD, focusing upon novel strategies and the most recent research.	Kochan, L D;Qureshi, A I;Fallon, B A	2000 Aug
11114440	Biomechanics of the cervical spine Part 2. Cervical spine soft tissue responses and biomechanical modeling.	OBJECTIVE: The responses and contributions of the soft tissue structures of the human neck are described with a focus on mathematical modeling. Spinal ligaments, intervertebral discs, zygapophysial joints, and uncovertebral joints of the cervical spine are included. Finite element modeling approaches have been emphasized. Representative data relevant to the development and execution of the model are discussed. A brief description is given on the functional mechanical role of the soft tissue components. Geometrical characteristics such as length and cross-sectional areas, and material properties such as force-displacement and stress-strain responses, are described for all components. Modeling approaches are discussed for each soft tissue structure. The final discussion emphasizes the normal and abnormal (e.g., degenerative joint disease, iatrogenic alteration, trauma) behaviors of the cervical spine with a focus on all these soft tissue responses. A brief description is provided on the modeling of the developmental biomechanics of the pediatric spine with a focus on soft tissues. Relevance. Experimentally validated models based on accurate geometry, material property, boundary, and loading conditions are useful to delineate the clinical biomechanics of the spine. Both external and internal responses of the various spinal components, a data set not obtainable directly from experiments, can be determined using computational models. Since soft tissues control the complex structural response, an accurate simulation of their anatomic, functional, and biomechanical characteristics is necessary to understand the behavior of the cervical spine under normal and abnormal conditions such as facetectomy, discectomy, laminectomy, and fusion.

11081541	Yoga and chemoreflex response to hypoxia and hypercapnia.	We tested whether chemoreflex sensitivity could be affected by the practice of yoga, and whether this is specifically because of a slow breathing rate obtained during yoga or as a general consequence of yoga. We found that slow breathing rate per se substantially reduced chemoreflex sensitivity, but long-term yoga practice was responsible for a generalised reduction in chemoreflex.

11076447	Hatha yoga: improved vital capacity of college students.	CONTEXT: The vital capacity of the lungs is a critical component of good health. Vital capacity is an important concern for those with asthma, heart conditions, and lung ailments; those who smoke; and those who have no known lung problems. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of yoga postures and breathing exercises on vital capacity. DESIGN: Using the Spiropet spirometer, researchers measured vital capacity. Vital capacity determinants were taken near the beginning and end of two 17-week semesters. No control group was used. SETTING: Midwestern university yoga classes taken for college credit. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 287 college students, 89 men and 198 women. INTERVENTION: Subjects were taught yoga poses, breathing techniques, and relaxation in two 50-minute class meetings for 15 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Vital capacity over time for smokers, asthmatics, and those with no known lung disease. RESULTS: The study showed a statistically significant (P < .001) improvement in vital capacity across all categories over time. CONCLUSIONS: It is not known whether these findings were the result of yoga poses, breathing techniques, relaxation, or other aspects of exercise in the subjects' life. The subjects' adherence to attending class was 99.96%. The large number of 287 subjects is considered to be a valid number for a study of this type. These findings are consistent with other research studies reporting the positive effect of yoga on the vital capacity of the lungs.	Birkel, D A;Edgren, L	2000 Nov
11074395	Treatments for fatigue in multiple sclerosis: a rapid and systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an important problem both for people with the disease and for society. There is no cure, and alleviation of symptoms forms the cornerstone of care. Excessive fatigue that severely limits activity is experienced by at least two-thirds of the estimated 60,000 people with MS in the UK. OBJECTIVES: (1) To identify current treatments for fatigue in MS and their evidence-base. (2) To systematically review the evidence for those treatments that have been investigated in more than one rigorous study, in order to determine their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. METHODS: The review was carried out in two stages: a formal scoping review (to assess the range of interventions used by people with MS), and a systematic review for treatments that had been identified as promising and that had been investigated in clinical trials (as identified in the scoping review). A systematic review of research on costs and cost-effectiveness of those interventions identified as promising was also performed. Electronic databases, including MEDLINE and EMBASE, were searched for the period 1991-June 1999 (scoping review) and 1966-December 1999 (systematic review). Reference lists from publications were also searched, and experts were contacted for any additional information not already identified. RESULTS: Interventions identified for the treatment of fatigue in MS (1) Behavioural advice. This is the main element of initial clinical management and no rigorous research of its effectiveness was identified. (2) Drugs (amantadine, pemoline, potassium-channel blockers and antidepressants). (3) Training, rehabilitation and devices (cooling vests and electromagnetic fields). (4) Alternative therapies (bee venom, cannabis, acupuncture/acupressure and yoga). Only two drugs, amantadine and pemoline, met the criteria for full systematic review. RESULTS - EFFECTIVENESS OF AMANTADINE: One parallel and three crossover trials were found, involving a total of 236 people with MS. All studies were open to bias. All studies showed a pattern in favour of amantadine compared with placebo, but there is considerable uncertainty about the validity and clinical significance of this finding. This pattern of benefit was considerably undermined when different assumptions were used in the sensitivity analysis. RESULTS - EFFECTIVENESS OF PEMOLINE: One parallel and one crossover trial were found involving a total of 126 people with MS. Both studies were open to bias. There was no overall tendency in favour of pemoline over placebo and an excess of reports of adverse effects with pemoline. RESULTS - HEALTH ECONOMIC ANALYSIS: The drug costs of amantadine and pemoline are modest (pound 200 and pound 80 per annum, respectively). No economic evaluations were identified in the systematic review, and available data were insufficient to allow modelling of cost-effectiveness in this rapid review. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to allow people with MS, clinicians or policy makers to make informed decisions on the appropriate use of the many treatments on offer. Only amantadine appears to have some proven ability to alleviate the fatigue in MS, though only a proportion of users will obtain benefit and then only some of these patients will benefit sufficiently to take the drug in the long term. CONCLUSIONS - RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RESEARCH: The frequency, severity and impact of fatigue, the poverty of available research, and the absence of any ongoing research, suggest that new research is an urgent priority. People with MS, clinicians and policy makers should work together to ensure that the evidence required is collected as quickly as possible by encouraging involvement in rigorous research. Research should not be restricted to the two drugs reviewed in depth in this report. All interventions identified in the scoping review (see above) should be considered, as should basic scientific research into the underlying mechanism of fatigue in MS.

11016181	The problems of hypertension in the elderly.	The cut off age for elderly person in India is 60-65 years, in the USA is 75-80 years and 6th Joint Committee on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-VI) has identified it as above 60 years. Elderly people may have (i) systolic-diastolic hypertension, (ii) isolated systolic hypertension or (iii) pseudohypertension. JNC-VI has classified hypertension in stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3 according to its severity. Hypertension is confirmed when BP measured on three separate occasions over 1-2 weeks and when consistently it is raised above 140/90 mm Hg. The management includes lifestyle modification and drug treatment. Lifestyle modification includes rationality of diet, regular exercise, stop smoking, stoppage of alcohol or moderation and yoga. Drugs commonly used are diureties and beta-blockers. Other antihypertensive drugs are calcium channel blockers, ACE-inhibitors, alpha-blockers and vasodilators.	Arya, S N	2000 Apr
11002644	Alternative medicine--old wine in a new bottle.	Alternative medicine encompasses ancient medical practices of Ayurveda, Unani, Tibbi, chiropractice, acupuncture and others alike. This part of medicine ignores mechanisms of drug action and relies on antique methods and natural remedies. It has no study of pathology, rather depends on philosophy. One must take note of ethno-botany in the evolution of ancient medicines. Ethnobotany reflects the use of drugs available in natural places. Use of natural plants as medicine by the animals is very interesting to observe. Some religious practices like namaz and yoga constitute body exercises and are encouraged in alternative medicine. Chiropractice is a manual mode of treating in painful conditions of back, ankle and knee. Acupuncture is an age old process and practised mainly in China for various ailments.	Bagchi, A K	2000 Jun
10960106	Mutations in multidrug efflux homologs, sugar isomerases, and antimicrobial biosynthesis genes differentially elevate activity of the sigma(X) and sigma(W) factors in Bacillus subtilis.	The sigma(X) and sigma(W) extracytoplasmic function sigma factors regulate more than 40 genes in Bacillus subtilis. sigma(W) activates genes which function in detoxification and the production of antimicrobial compounds, while sigma(X) activates functions that modify the cell envelope. Transposon mutagenesis was used to identify loci which negatively regulate sigma(W) or sigma(X) as judged by up-regulation from the autoregulatory promoter site P(W) or P(X). Fourteen insertions that activate P(W) were identified. The largest class of insertions are likely to affect transport. These include insertions in genes encoding two multidrug efflux protein homologs (yqgE and yulE), a component of the oligopeptide uptake system (oppA), and two transmembrane proteins with weak similarity to transporters (yhdP and yueF). Expression from P(W) is also elevated as a result of inactivation of at least one member of the sigma(W) regulon (ysdB), an ArsR homolog (yvbA), a predicted rhamnose isomerase (yulE), and a gene (pksR) implicated in synthesis of difficidin, a polyketide antibiotic. In a parallel screen, we identified seven insertions that up-regulate P(X). Remarkably, these insertions were in functionally similar genes, including a multidrug efflux homolog (yitG), a mannose-6-phosphate isomerase gene (yjdE), and loci involved in antibiotic synthesis (srfAB and possibly yogA and yngK). Significantly, most insertions that activate P(W) have little or no effect on P(X), and conversely, insertions that activate P(X) have no effect on P(W). This suggests that these two regulons respond to distinct sets of molecular signals which may include toxic molecules which are exported, cell density signals, and antimicrobial compounds.

10908505	Yoga for epilepsy.	BACKGROUND: Stress is considered an important precipitating factor for seizures. Yoga is believed to induce relaxation and stress reduction. The effect of yoga on the EEG and the autonomic nervous system have been reported. Yoga would be an attractive therapeutic option for epilepsy (if proved effective), in view of its nonpharmacological nature, minimal side effects and international acceptance. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy of yoga in the treatment of patients with epilepsy. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group trial register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library Issue 4, 1998), MEDLINE for articles published up to the middle of 1998, and also registries of the research council for complimentary medicine were searched. In addition, we searched the references of all the identified studies. Finally, we contacted the members of the Neurological Society of India, several neurophysiology institutions and yoga institutes to seek any ongoing studies or studies published in nonindexed journals or unpublished studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized control trials and controlled clinical trials of treatment of epilepsy with yoga. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The data were extracted independently by both reviewers and any discrepancies were resolved by discussion. The main outcomes assessed were percentage of patients rendered seizure free, number of patients with more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency or seizure duration and the overall reduction in seizure frequency. Analyses were on an intention to treat basis. MAIN RESULTS: Only one study met the selection criteria, and recruited a total of 32 patients, 10 to sahaja yoga and 22 to control treatments. Antiepileptic drugs were continued in all. Randomization was by roll of a dice. The results of this study are as follows: (i) Four patients treated with yoga were seizure free for six months compared to none in the control groups. The Odds Ratio (OR) (95% Confidence Interval (CI)) for yoga versus sham yoga group was 14.5 (0.7, 316.7) and for yoga versus no treatment group 17.3 (0.8, 373.5). (ii) Nine patients in the yoga group had more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency compared to only one among the controls. The OR (95% CI) for yoga versus sham yoga group was 81 (4.4, 1504.5) and for the yoga versus no treatment group was 158.3 (5.8, 4335.9). (iii) There was a decline in the average number of attacks per month compared to the baseline frequency among the patients treated with yoga. The weighted mean difference ( 95% CI) between yoga versus sham yoga group was -2.1 (-3.1, -1.0) and for the yoga versus no treatment group -1.1 (-1.8, -0.4). (iv) More than 50% reduction in seizure duration was found in seven of the 10 patients treated with yoga, compared to none among the 22 controls. The OR (95%CI) for yoga versus sham yoga group was 45 (2.0, 1006.8) and for yoga versus no treatment group 53.57 (2.4, 1187.3). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: No reliable conclusions can be drawn regarding the efficacy of yoga as a treatment for epilepsy. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of yoga in the treatment of epilepsy.	Ramaratnam, S;Sridharan, K	2000
10883793	Decrease in serum cortisol during yoga exercise is correlated with alpha wave activation.	We examined changes in brain waves and blood levels of serum cortisol during yoga exercise in 7 yoga instructors and found that alpha waves increased and serum cortisol decreased. These two measures were negatively correlated (r = -.83). Comparison with a control group of nonpractitioners is desirable.	Kamei, T;Toriumi, Y;Kimura, H;Ohno, S;Kumano, H;Kimura, K	2000 Jun
10876066	Acute increases in night-time plasma melatonin levels following a period of meditation.	To determine whether a period of meditation could influence melatonin levels, two groups of meditators were tested in a repeated measures design for changes in plasma melatonin levels at midnight. Experienced meditators practising either TM-Sidhi or another internationally well known form of yoga showed significantly higher plasma melatonin levels in the period immediately following meditation compared with the same period at the same time on a control night. It is concluded that meditation, at least in the two forms studied here, can affect plasma melatonin levels. It remains to be determined whether this is achieved through decreased hepatic metabolism of the hormone or via a direct effect on pineal physiology. Either way, facilitation of higher physiological melatonin levels at appropriate times of day might be one avenue through which the claimed health promoting effects of meditation occur.

10874346	Recovery from stress in two different postures and in Shavasana--a yogic relaxation posture.	The recovery from induced physiological stress in Shavasana (a yogic relaxation posture) and two other postures (resting in chair and resting supine posture) was compared. Twenty one males and 6 females (age 21-30 yrs) were allowed to take rest in one of the above postures immediately after completing the scheduled treadmill running. The recovery was assessed in terms of Heart Rate (HR) and Blood pressure (BP). HR and BP were measured before and every two minutes after the treadmill running till they returned to the initial level. The results revealed that the effects of stress was reversed in significantly (P < 0.01) shorter time in Shavasana, compared to the resting posture in chair and a supine posture.

10874345	Effect of two selected yogic breathing techniques of heart rate variability.	The heart rate variability (HRV) is an indicator of the cardiac autonomic control. Two spectral components are usually recorded, viz. high frequency (0.15-0.50 Hz), which is due to vagal efferent activity and a low frequency component (0.05-0.15 Hz), due to sympathetic activity. The present study was conducted to study the HRV in two yoga practices which have been previously reported to have opposite effects, viz, sympathetic stimulation (kapalabhati, breathing at high frequency, i.e., 2.0 Hz) and reduced sympathetic activity (nadisuddhi, alternate nostril breathing). Twelve male volunteers (age range, 21 to 33 years) were assessed before and after each practice on separate days. The electrocardiogram (lead I) was digitized on-line and off-line analysis was done. The results showed a significant increase in low frequency (LF) power and LF/HF ratio while high frequency (HF) power was significantly lower following kapalabhati. There were no significant changes following nadisuddhi. The results suggest that kapalabhati modifies the autonomic status by increasing sympathetic activity with reduced vagal activity. The study also suggests that HRV is a more useful psychophysiological measure than heart rate alone.	Raghuraj, P;Ramakrishnan, A G;Nagendra, H R;Telles, S	1998 Oct
10863818	Complementary therapies and the general practitioner. A survey of Perth GPs.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify the knowledge, attitudes and referral patterns of general practitioners (GPs) toward 10 specific complementary therapies. METHOD: The study was a descriptive cross-sectional postal survey, conducted between July 1998 and August 1998 inclusive. A random selection of 200 male and 200 female Western Australian GPs residing in Perth and listed in the Australian Medical Association database file of registered GPs. RESULTS: The response rate was 74.8% (n = 282). Over 90% of these GPs reported having been approached by more than 30 patients seeking their advice about complementary therapies in the past nine months. The majority of these patients were women, over the age of 35 years. Ten complementary therapies were listed in the questionnaire: acupuncture, hypnosis, meditation, spinal manipulation, yoga, homeopathy, herbal medicine, naturopathy, massage and aromatherapy. Just under half (132) of the respondents had undertaken studies in at least one of the listed complementary therapies, with over 60% reporting a wish for further training. Overall, 67.8% (191) of all respondents reported they were in favour of GP referrals to complementary therapists. However, 56.1% (158) were against complementary therapies being included in rebates for private health insurance. Overall, 75.0% (211) of GPs surveyed had already formally referred a patient to one or more of the listed therapies, the most frequent of these being acupuncture, massage, meditation, hypnosis and spinal manipulation as a part of their overall medical treatment. CONCLUSION: Perth GPs have a high level of interest in complementary therapies. Government regulation and registration of complementary therapies is seen by GPs as important in order to ensure professional standards of practice. Given the high level of interest, provision of undergraduate and postgraduate education in complementary therapies could be considered. In addition, the development of clinical guidelines would be of benefit.	Hall, K;Giles-Corti, B	2000 Jun
10859600	How the public classify complementary medicine: a factor analytic study.	OBJECTIVES: To see how lay people group or classify various CAM therapies. DESIGN: Nearly 600 adults rated 39 relatively familiar branches of complementary medicine on four dimensions: whether they had heard of it, whether they think they know how it works; whether they had tried it; and a rating of efficacy on a 10-point scale. RESULTS: As predicted those most heard of were acupuncture, aromatherapy, herbal medicine, hypnosis, massage and yoga while those with lowest ratings were autogenic training, ayurveda, biochemic tissue salts, chelation cell therapy and ozone therapy. A number of multivariate statistical techniques were used to attempt to investigate the perceived dimensional structure of the different therapies. Slightly different structures emerged depending on the question asked and the analysis computed. CONCLUSION: The 'bottom-up' empirically derived taxonomization of therapies was interpretable and showed 10 different factors. The issue of classifying or taxonomizing complementary medicines is discussed.	Furnham, A	2000 Jun
10846637	Effect of selected yogic practices on the management of hypertension.	On the basis of medical officers diagnosis, thirty three (N = 33) hypertensives, aged 35-65 years, from Govt. General Hospital, Pondicherry, were examined with four variables viz, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate and body weight. The subjects were randomly assigned into three groups. The exp. group-I underwent selected yoga practices, exp. group-II received medical treatment by the physician of the said hospital and the control group did not participate in any of the treatment stimuli. Yoga imparted in the morning and in the evening with 1 hr/session. day-1 for a total period of 11-weeks. Medical treatment comprised drug intake every day for the whole experimental period. The result of pre-post test with ANCOVA revealed that both the treatment stimuli (i.e., yoga and drug) were effective in controlling the variables of hypertension.

10846636	Effect of yogic practices on subjective well being.	Forty eight healthy volunteers who participated in the practice of yoga over a period of 4 months were assessed on Subjective Well Being Inventory (SUBI) before and after the course in order to evaluate the effect of practice of yoga on subjective feelings of well-being and quality of life. A significant improvement in 9 of the 11 factors of SUBI was observed at the end of 4 months, in these participants. The paper thus, reiterates the beneficial effects of regular practice of yoga on subjective well being.	Malathi, A;Damodaran, A;Shah, N;Patil, N;Maratha, S	2000 Apr
10846635	Effect of yoga training on maze learning.	The performance in a maze learning task was assessed in adults of either sex (n = 31) before and after 30 days of yoga training and in an age and gender matched control group of subjects who did not receive training in yoga. Subjects were blind folded and used the dominant hand to trace the path in a wooden pencil maze. At each assessment, subjects were given 5 trials, without a gap between them. Performance was based on the time taken to complete the maze and the number of blind alleys taken. The time and error scores of Trial 1 were significantly less after yoga (two-factor ANOVA, Tukey test). Repeating trials significantly decreased time scores at Trial 5 versus Trial 1, for both groups on Day 1 and for the control group on Day 30. Hence the yoga group showed improved performance in maze tracing at retest 30 days later, which may be related to this group being faster learners and also the effect of yoga itself. Yoga training did not influence maze learning, based on the performance in 5 repeat trials.	Telles, S;Ramaprabhu, V;Reddy, S K	2000 Apr
10832506	Effect of Sahaja yoga meditation on auditory evoked potentials (AEP) and visual contrast sensitivity (VCS) in epileptics.	The effect of Sahaja yoga meditation on 32 patients with primary idiopathic epilepsy on regular and maintained antiepileptic medication was studied. The patients were randomly divided into 3 groups: group I practiced Sahaja Yoga meditation twice daily for 6 months under proper guidance; group II practiced postural exercises mimicking the meditation for the same duration; and group III was the control group. Visual Contrast Sensitivity (VCS), Auditory Evoked Potentials (AEP), Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials (BAEP), and Mid Latency Responses (MLR) were recorded initially (0 month) and at 3 and 6 months for each group. There was a significant improvement in VCS following meditation practice in group I participants. Na, the first prominent negative peak of MLR and Pa, the positive peak following Na did not register changes in latency. The Na-Pa amplitude of MLR also showed a significant increase. There were no significant changes in the absolute and interpeak latencies of BAEP. The reduced level of stress following meditation practice may make patients more responsive to specific stimuli. Sahaja Yoga meditation appears to bring about changes in some of the electrophysiological responses studied in epileptic patients.

10807996	Experimental production of extra- and intra-articular fractures of the os calcis.	Although studies have been conducted in the past to duplicate traumatic fractures of the os calcis, biomechanical force data as a function of extra- and intra-articular fractures are not available. Consequently, in this study, a dynamic single impact model was used to provide such information. Using intact human cadaver lower extremities, impact loading was applied to the plantar surface of the foot using a mini-sled pendulum equipment. The proximal tibia was fixed in polymethylmethacrylate. Following impact, pathology to the os calcis was classified into intact (no injury; 14 cases), and extra-articular (6 cases) and intra-articular (6 cases) fractures. Peak dynamic forces were used to conduct statistical analysis. Mean forces for the intact and (both) fracture groups were 4144 N (standard error, SE: 689) and 7802 N (SE: 597). Mean forces for the extra- and intra-articular fracture groups were 7445 N (SE: 711) and 8159 N (SE: 1006). The peak force influenced injury outcome (ANOVA, p<0.005). Differences in the forces were found between intact and injured specimens (p<0.01); intact specimens and specimens with extra-articular pathology (p<0.001); intact specimens and specimens with intra-articular pathology (p<0.005). The present experimental protocol, which successfully reproduced clinically relevant os calcis pathology, can be extended to accommodate other variables such as the simulation of Achilles tendon force, the inclusion of other angles of force application, and the application of the impact force to limited regions of the plantar force of the foot in order to study other injury mechanisms.

(iv) More than 50% reduction in seizure duration was found in seven of the 10 patients treated with yoga, compared to none among the 22 controls. The OR (95%CI) for yoga versus sham yoga group was 45 (2.0, 1006.8) and for yoga versus no treatment group 53.57 (2.4, 1187.3). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: No reliable conclusions can be drawn regarding the efficacy of yoga as a treatment for epilepsy. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of yoga in the treatment of epilepsy.	Ramaratnam, S;Sridharan, K	2000
10787763	The use of alternative and complementary medicine in radiology today.	There is a quiet revolution challenging our Western philosophy of reactive, high-tech allopathic medicine, which cures disease by treatments. This trend to a proactive, preventive, Eastern style of medicine is referred to as holistic or alternative and complementary medicine (ACM). ACM is based on the belief that human beings are living energy systems rather than an arrangement of parts. Any disturbance in the body, mind or spirit will result in a disturbance in the whole system. In January 1993, the New England Journal of Medicine published a study that documented the rise of ACM in the United States. Expenditures associated with the use of unconventional therapies in 1990 amounted to approximately $13.7 billion, three quarters of which ($10.3 billion) was paid for out of pocket. ACM techniques that are currently used in diagnostic imaging departments include guided imagery, anodyne imagery, aromatherapy and hydrotherapy. Radiology can play a crucial role in moving beyond allopathic and complementary medicine to a combination approach.	Puchalski, L	2000 Jan-Feb

10776462	Sudomotor sympathetic hypofunction in Down's syndrome.	General sympathetic dysfunction has been proposed as an explanation for the inability to reach normal heightened attention in Down's syndrome (DS). The present study on 15 DS subjects (group average age +/- SD, 14.3 +/- 3.6 years; 11 males) and in an equal number of age- and gender-matched normal subjects (NS), evaluated activity in different subdivisions of the sympathetic nervous system. DS subjects had (i) lower skin conductance levels (i.e., lower sudomotor sympathetic activity) and (ii) higher heart rates than NS. In response to auditory stimuli, DS subjects showed abnormal SSR responses (also indicating sudomotor sympathetic activity) but normal cutaneous vasoconstriction. Hence the results suggest that sympathetic dysfunction in DS is restricted to the sudomotor subdivision, activity of which has been associated with attention and recognition.

10776461	Yoga training and motor speed based on a finger tapping task.	A finger tapping task was used to assess motor speed (MS) of both hands in 53 adults and 152 children before and after yoga training and in 38 adults of a non-yoga (control) group. All subjects were right hand dominant. The 30-second tapping speed (TS) test was considered as three time intervals, i.e. 0-10 second (TS1), 10-20 seconds (TS2) and 20-30 seconds (TS3). There was a significant (Student's t-test) increase in all three TS values following 10 days of yoga in children and 30 days of yoga in adults. However for both groups at baseline and final assessments, TS2 and TS3 were significantly lower than TS1. Hence the TS was increased after yoga training during the first 10-seconds of the test but not during the next 20 seconds. These results suggest an increase in motor speed for repetitive finger movements following yoga training, but not in strength or endurance, as the increase was not sustained over 30 sec.

10751018	Sports and other soft tissue injuries, tendinitis, bursitis, and occupation-related syndromes.	This review highlights three areas: plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendinitis, and carpal tunnel syndrome. The diagnosis and treatment of plantar fasciitis are reviewed; nonsurgical treatments remain the mainstay of management. Several recent articles support the use of night splints. Some novel treatments recently investigated, including low intensity laser irradiation and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, are reviewed, as well as the effectiveness of steroid injection. Novel treatments for Achilles tendinitis are also reviewed, including the use of injection therapy and the treatment approach of one author for the management of Achilles tendon rupture. Nonsurgical techniques in the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome, such as yoga, ultrasound, noninvasive laser neurolysis, manipulation, nerve and tendon gliding exercises, and medications, are reviewed. Prednisolone was shown to be effective in the treatment of mild to moderate disease and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were found to be ineffective.

10710803	A review of mind/body therapies in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders with implications for the elderly.	BACKGROUND: A comprehensive, but not systematic, review of the research on complementary and alternative treatments, specifically mind/body techniques, on musculoskeletal disease was conducted at Stanford University. The goals of the review were to establish a comprehensive literature review and provide a rationale for future research carrying the theme of "successful aging." METHODS: Computerized searches were conducted using MEDLINE, PsychInfo, Stanford Library, Dissertation Abstracts, Lexus-Nexus, the Internet as well as interviews conducted with practitioners and the elderly. Mind/body practices evaluated were: social support, cognitive-behavioral therapy, meditation, the placebo effect, imagery, visualization, spiritual/energy healing, music therapy, hypnosis, yoga, tai chi, and qigong. Studies published after 1990 were the priority, but when more recent literature was scarce, other controlled studies were included. RESULTS: Mind/body techniques were found to be efficacious primarily as complementary treatments for musculoskeletal disease and related disorders. Studies provided evidence for treatment efficacy but most apparent was the need for further controlled research. CONCLUSIONS: Reviewers found a dearth of randomized controlled research conducted in the US. There is a lack of studies with which to determine appropriate dosage and understand the mechanisms by which many of the practices work. Anecdotal evidence, some controlled research, clinical observation, as well as the cost effectiveness and lack of side effects of the mind/body treatments make further investigation a high priority.

10708840	Antidepressant efficacy of Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) in melancholia: a randomized comparison with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and imipramine.	BACKGROUND: Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) is a procedure that involves essentially rhythmic hyperventilation at different rates of breathing. The antidepressant efficacy of SKY was demonstrated in dysthymia in a prospective, open clinical trial. This study compared the relative antidepressant efficacy of SKY in melancholia with two of the current standard treatments, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and imipramine (IMN). METHODS: Consenting, untreated melancholic depressives (n=45) were hospitalized and randomized equally into three treatment groups. They were assessed at recruitment and weekly thereafter for four weeks. RESULTS: Significant reductions in the total scores on Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) occurred on successive occasions in all three groups. The groups, however, did not differ. Significant interaction between the groups and occasion of assessment occurred. At week three, the SKY group had higher scores than the ECT group but was not different from the IMN group. Remission (total HRSD score of seven or less) rates at the end of the trial were 93, 73 and 67% in the ECT, IMN and SKY groups, respectively. No clinically significant side effects were observed. DISCUSSION: Within the limitations of the design (lack of double blind conditions), it can be concluded that, although inferior to ECT, SKY can be a potential alternative to drugs in melancholia as a first line treatment.

20086629	Beyond the mind-body exercise hype.	Mind-body exercise methods are spreading rapidly throughout the health, fitness, and rehabilitation fields. Many of the claimed benefits for these activities are not supported by clinical evidence, and, as alternative therapies, they carry legal and professional ramifications. Understanding the nature of mind-body exercise and knowing the scientific evidence behind claims for its benefits can help clinicians make appropriate recommendations to patients. For example, yoga and tai chi can reduce stress, decrease hypertension, and exert cardiorespiratory benefits, and tai chi can improve balance in seniors. However, there is not enough evidence to support replacing conventional medical treatments with somatic methods.	Ives, J C;Sosnoff, J	2000 Mar
10680200	Yoga.	Yoga is an ancient tradition that has been westernized and often practiced for its proposed health benefits. Traditional texts describe its benefits for many types of arthritis. Two limited studies of yoga in osteoarthritis of the hands and carpal tunnel syndrome show greater improvement in pain than in control groups. Yoga uses stretching and improves strength so that it theoretically should be beneficial for some musculoskeletal problems. Yoga merits further study into its cellular and physiologic effects.

10645695	Non-pharmacological management of essential hypertension.	Lifestyle modifications are universally accepted, not only as the first step in the management of hypertension but also a way to prevent hypertension. The INTERSALT study of 52 communities worldwide showed that weight, among all measured characteristics except age, had the strongest, significant, most consistent and independent correlation with blood pressure. INTERSALT epidemiological data had demonstrated a positive association between sodium intake and level of blood pressure. A rigorous analysis of 23 randomly controlled trials showed that 100 mmol/day reduction in sodium intake was associated with a decline of 5-7 mm Hg (systolic)/2.7 mm Hg (diastolic) in hypertensive subjects. Excessive alcohol consumption is another important risk factor for hypertension and has been reported to account for 5-30% of all hypertension. Moderately intense exercise at 40 to 60% of maximum oxygen consumption e.g., 30 to 45 minutes of brisk walking on 4-5 days a week, can lower blood pressure. The incidence of stroke and coronary artery disease in hypertensive patients who smoke is 2-3 times greater than in non-smoking patients with comparable blood pressure and stopping smoking rapidly reduces this risk. There have been several studies showing the stress reduction with various behavioural procedures, such as yoga, relaxation biofeedback, transcedental mediation and psychotherapy benefit hypertensive patients by lowering their blood pressure.

10579242	A review of current research in microwave resonance therapy: novel opportunities in medical treatment.	Microwave Resonance Therapy (MRT) is a novel medical treatment, which represents a synthesis of the ancient Chinese traditional knowledge in medicine (acupuncture) and recent breakthroughs in biophysics. By affecting the appropriate acupuncture points by the generation of high frequency microwaves (52-78 GHz), remarkable clinical results are being achieved in surgery, orthopedic and traumatology, cardiovascular disorders, urology, gynecology, dermatology, gastroenterology, pulmology, upper respiratory tract, cardiology, neurology, and oncology during the last decade--the MRT being contraindicated only in the cases of acute pain in the abdomen demanding an operation, pregnancy, and menstruation cycle. In this paper the quantum-like macroscopic biophysical basis of the MRT and its technical details are elaborated too, offering a new insight in the mechanisms of the assembling gap junction hemichannels upon the internal microwave (MW) electromagnetic field spatio-temporal maximums at the temporary position of the acupuncture system, and, hence, the very biophysical nature of the temporary psychosomatic health or disease. The quantum-like coherent characteristics of the MRT (sharply-resonant sensory response of the disordered organism, extremely low-intensity and low-energy non-thermal biologically efficient MW radiation, and negligible MW energy losses down acupuncture meridians) might be viewed as a consequence of the existence of biological nonlocal selfconsistent macroscopic quantum potentials, which can give rise to nonlinear coherent EM MW long-range maser-like excitations of biological nonlinear absorption medium with the cells as active centers--with acupuncture meridians related to eigenfrequencies and spatio-temporal eigenwaves distributions of every individual biological quantum system. This suggests that a healthy condition might be considered as an absolute minimum (ground state) of the nonlocal selfconsistent macroscopic quantum potential of the organism. Some disorders of an acupuncture system correspond to higher minimums of the (spatio-temporally changeable) potential hypersurface in energy-configuration space, which possibly explains the higher sensory responses of the more excited (more disordered) acupuncture system and the poor MRT sensory response of the healthy acupuncture system being already in the ground state. Such a picture also supports the EM/ionic "optical" ultralowfrequency modulated MW quantum holographic neural network-like function of the acupuncture system (similar to complex-valued oscillatory holographic Hopfield-like neural networks), and its essential relation to consciousness, as strongly suggested from biophysical modeling of altered states of consciousness. Finally, the ionic aspects of the acupuncture system are considered, too, as well as the relation of ultradian (approximately 2-hour) nasal rhythm recognized in Indian swara yoga and circadian (approximately 24-hour) acupuncture rhythm recognized in Chinese traditional medicine, and their significance for maintaining the ionic balance within acupuncture system, as related to overall health.

10578434	Wellness works: community service health promotion groups led by occupational therapy students.	OBJECTIVE: In the context of a group process course, occupational therapy students learned health promotion skills through working on personal wellness goals and leading community-based health promotion groups. The groups targeted topics such as smoking cessation, improving diet, reducing stress through yoga, meditation, tai chi chuan, ROM (Range of Motion) Dance, aerobics, and a variety of other activities. METHOD: After identifying a personal wellness goal and developing it in a Wellness Awareness Learning Contract, each student used a Goal Attainment Scale (GAS) to predict an expected outcome for achieving the goal and to measure his or her progress toward attaining the goal. Students also used the GAS to measure progress in attaining group leadership skills within the community groups, which they outlined in a separate Group Skills Contract. Students kept weekly logs to foster reflective thinking, and the logs were used for interactive dialogue with the instructor. To further evaluate lifestyle change, students compared pretest and posttest scores on a Self-Assessment Scorecard, which surveyed six areas of health and human potential in body, mind, and spirit. RESULTS: Students monitored their own change process on both their personal health lifestyle goals and their group leadership skills while developing a richer appreciation of the dynamics of working for change with clients in community and traditional settings. Differences on the Self-Assessment Scorecard indicated improvement on two of the six scales for physical health and choices. CONCLUSION: Students experienced firsthand the challenges of developing healthier lifestyles on the basis of their personal goals as well as through fostering group changes. The two GAS learning contracts provided them with concrete evidence of their growth and learning. This experience--embedded in the context of a group process course with a community service learning group practicum--provided most students with a positive initial experience with group leadership as they began to explore roles as agents for lifestyle and health change. Suggestions for expanding health promotion roles in practice in the changing health care environment are also examined.	Scott, A H	1999 Nov-Dec

10516981	Eastern movement therapies.	Tai chi, qigong, and yoga represent a class of exercise that differs from the routine strengthening and stretching programs currently employed in physical medicine. These techniques incorporate a "mind-body" approach to the rehabilitation of disorders commonly seen by physical medicine and rehabilitation clinicians. Research into the efficacy of these techniques clearly is in the beginning stages. What little has been conducted thus far is promising. These methods may serve to add valuable contributions to the continuity of care of ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients.	Farrell, S J;Ross, A D;Sehgal, K V	1999 Aug

10505621	Beneficial effect of proprioceptive physical activities on balance control in elderly human subjects.	Age and lack of physical activities may both be responsible for poor balance control. Conversely, physical activities may modulate postural control in elderly individuals. We examined which type of exercise might prove most beneficial to retain or regain proper balance. Nineteen healthy subjects, aged over 60, regularly practicing proprioceptive (group I) or bioenergetic (group II) physical activities and 21 controls only walking on a regular basis, were studied. All were submitted to a dynamic posturographic test and to a test evaluating lower limbs muscular strength. Control individuals displayed the poorest balance and muscular performance. Group I subjects had the best postural control with average muscular strength. In group II, muscular strength was significantly increased, but balance control was of poor quality. Proprioceptive exercise therefore appears to have the best impact on balance control.	Gauchard, G C;Jeandel, C;Tessier, A;Perrin, P P	1999 Oct 1

10483629	Stress, relaxation states, and creativity.	114 participants in four groups practiced 25 minutes of progressive muscle relaxation, yoga stretching, imagery, or a control task. Before and after training, participants took state versions of the Smith Quick Stress Test (which measures Somatic Stress, Negative Affect, and Worry) and the Smith R-State Inventory (which measures relaxation-related states Disengagement, Physical Relaxation, Mental Relaxation, Strength and Awareness, Joy, Love and Thankfulness, and Prayerfulness). After training, all took both the Verbal and Figural forms of the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. At posttest, groups' scores did not differ on Creativity; however, when compared with yoga stretching, imagery trainees had lower posttest scores on Negative Affect. Both yoga stretching and imagery trainees displayed higher scores on self-reported Physical Relaxation than did controls. Progressive muscle relaxation trainees had lower scores on Somatic Stress than controls. Paradoxically, for all relaxation trainees, Disengagement (feeling "distant, far away, indifferent") correlated positively with both Negative Affect and Physical Relaxation, suggesting that disengagement in relaxation may not lead to relaxation-induced anxiety but may help one cope with such anxiety.

10454297	Exaggerated heart rate oscillations during two meditation techniques.	We report extremely prominent heart rate oscillations associated with slow breathing during specific traditional forms of Chinese Chi and Kundalini Yoga meditation techniques in healthy young adults. We applied both spectral analysis and a novel analytic technique based on the Hilbert transform to quantify these heart rate dynamics. The amplitude of these oscillations during meditation was significantly greater than in the pre-meditation control state and also in three non-meditation control groups: i) elite athletes during sleep, ii) healthy young adults during metronomic breathing, and iii) healthy young adults during spontaneous nocturnal breathing. This finding, along with the marked variability of the beat-to-beat heart rate dynamics during such profound meditative states, challenges the notion of meditation as only an autonomically quiescent state.

10406987	(123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy in Parkinson's disease.	OBJECTIVES: (123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy is clinically used to estimate local myocardial sympathetic nerve damage in some forms of heart disease, autonomic nerve disturbance in diabetic neuropathy, and disturbance of the autonomic nervous system in neurodegenerative disease. In the present study, examinations were performed to clarify (1) the proportion of cardiac sympathetic nerve disturbance in Parkinson's disease, (2) the usefulness of (123)I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy to detect sympathetic nerve disturbances compared with autonomic function tests, (3) cardiac function in patients who have a decreased MIBG uptake in (123)I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy, (4) the usefulness of (123)I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy to differentiate Parkinson's disease from the other neurological diseases mimicking it. METHODS: (123)I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy was performed, together with autonomic function tests and cardiac examinations in 46 patients with Parkinson's disease and 25 patients with vascular parkinsonism, essential tremor, or multiple system atrophy. RESULTS: In an anterior image study, the average count per pixel in heart to mediastinum (H/M) ratio decreased in 80% of the patients with Parkinson's disease in the early phase and 84% in the late phase. The mean H/M ratio in Parkinson's disease was significantly lower than that in controls and the other diseases. The H/M ratio tended to decrease with the disease progression. In almost half of the patients in Hoehn and Yahr stage I, the H/M ratio was already decreased. The sympathetic skin response in upper and lower limbs, head up tilt test, and coefficient of variation of R-R interval were abnormal in 17%, 31%, 30%, and 17% of the patients, respectively. All the patients with abnormal autonomic functions were in Hoehn and Yahr stage III, IV, or V. Echocardiography showed normal left ventricular function. Twenty four hour Holter electrocardiography detected no serious arrhythmias except for one patient with non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. CONCLUSION: (123)I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy might detect early disturbances of the sympathetic nervous system in Parkinson's disease and might give useful diagnostic information to differentiate vascular parkinsonism, essential tremor, and multiple system atrophy from Parkinson's disease.

Medical and nonmedical students completed a questionnaire indicating how willing they would be to try various therapies for treatment. Both groups assessed more traditional complementary practices such as homeopathy and acupuncture as similar to more orthodox treatments such as physiotherapy or prescribed diets. Both groups appeared not to differentiate between established techniques (physiotherapy) and less tested techniques (yoga). Furthermore, neither group seemed particularly concerned about the scientific evaluations of treatments.	Yardley, L;Furnham, A	1999 Jun

10365316	Factors influencing changes in tweezer dexterity scores following yoga training.	Yoga has already been shown to improve perceptual-motor skills, but the factors which influence its effects are not well defined. This study correlates age, gender, and motivation to learn yoga with the performance in a dexterity task following yoga. Tweezer dexterity was recorded in eighty subjects belonging to four groups. Two groups were given a month of yoga training. One group consisted of subjects who had volunteered to join for the training and the other group were deputed for the training as part of their job. The two remaining groups did not receive yoga training and were selected to match the respective groups receiving yoga, for age and sex, but not for their motivation to learn yoga. The test involved using a tweezer to place metal pins in evenly spaced holes in a metal plate within four minutes. Following yoga the scores of the volunteers who learnt yoga increased significantly, whereas there was no change in scores of deputed subjects and non-yoga groups. For reasons described in detail, factors such as age and gender did not appear to contribute to the difference in performance. Hence motivation to learn yoga appeared to influence the magnitude of increase.	Manjunath, N K;Telles, S	1999 Apr
10365315	Stress due to exams in medical students--role of yoga.	A student under optimal stress does bring out his or her best, However extremes of stress can result in stress induced disorders and deteriorating performance. Can yoga be of benefit in stress induced effects in medical students? The present study was conducted in first MBBS students (n = 50) to determine the benefit if any of yogic practices on anxiety status during routine activities and prior to examination. Feedback scores were assessed to determine how the students had benefited from the practices. Anxiety status as assessed by Spillberger's anxiety scale showed a statistically significant reduction following practice. In addition the anxiety score which rose prior to exams showed a statistically significant reduction on the day of exam after practice. These results point to the beneficial role of yoga in not only causing reduction in basal anxiety level but also attenuating the increase in anxiety score in stressful state such as exams. The results of the exam indicated a statistically significant reduction in number of failures in yoga group as compared to the control group. The improvement in various parameters such as better sense of well being, feeling of relaxation, improved concentration, self confidence, improved efficiency, good interpersonal relationship, increased attentiveness, lowered irritability levels, and an optimistic outlook in life were some of the beneficial effects enjoyed by the yoga group indicated by feedback score.

10332925	Meditation and prostate cancer: integrating a mind/body intervention with traditional therapies.	There is growing attention to the health benefits of mind/body interventions, particularly relaxation and meditation. Biomedical research has provided undeniable evidence of the interconnectedness of the mind and body. The field of psychoneuroimmunology has defined the role of stress in reducing effectiveness of the immune system in combating infection and growth of malignant tumors. This article explains the development of meditation practice and explores the indications that the practice of meditation is effective reducing the harmful effects of stress. In addition, there are encouraging reports of studies citing the influence of melatonin on breast and prostate tumors. A preliminary study finds an association between meditation practice and levels of melatonin produced by the pineal gland.	Coker, K H	1999 May
10327777	Lipid profile of coronary risk subjects following yogic lifestyle intervention.	The effect of yogic lifestyle on the lipid status was studied in angina patients and normal subjects with risk factors of coronary artery disease. The parameters included the body weight, estimation of serum cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, LDL and the cholesterol - HDL ratio. A baseline evaluation was done and then the angina patients and risk factors subjects were randomly assigned as control (n = 41) and intervention (yoga) group (n = 52). Lifestyle advice was given to both the groups. An integrated course of yoga training was given for four days followed by practice at home. Serial evaluation of both the groups was done at four, 10 and 14 weeks. Dyslipidemia was a constant feature in all cases. An inconsistent pattern of change was observed in the control group of angina (n = 18) and risk factor subjects (n = 23). The subjects practising yoga showed a regular decrease in all lipid parameters except HDL. The effect started from four weeks and lasted for 14 weeks. Thus, the effect of yogic lifestyle on some of the modifiable risk factors could probably explain the preventive and therapeutic beneficial effect observed in coronary artery disease.

10235665	Muscle power, dexterity skill and visual perception in community home girls trained in yoga or sports and in regular school girls.	The present study was conducted to compare critical flicker fusion frequency (CFF), degree of optical illusion ("di"), dexterity scores, and grip strength in three groups of subjects, viz community home girls who had learned yoga for 6 months (CHY), age-matched community home girls who had physical activity training for 6 months (CHP), and girls who were attending a regular school (SCH). There were equal numbers in each group for each of the 4 assessment (range 11 to 30 subjects) and age range was 12 to 16 years of age. The CHP group had significantly lower CFF and "di" was significantly higher (one factor ANOVA, t test for unpaired data) in the CHP group, both compared to CHY and SCH groups. Right hand grip strength was also significantly less in the CHP group compared to SCH. The results were explained by previous reports of high levels of anxiety and aggression in community-home groups, which is known to influence the four parameters described here. The better performance of the CHY group compared to CHP, suggested that yoga practice has a beneficial effect in these subjects.	Raghuraj, P;Telles, S	1997 Oct
10225047	A new physiological approach to control essential hypertension.	This study was conducted on 20 male patients of Essential Hypertension (EH) in order to explore the possible role of baroreflex mechanism in the etiology of EH and also to find out whether by restoration of baroreflex sensitivity to normal level either by postural tilt stimulus on a tilt table or by the equivalent yogic postural exercise (Yogic asanas), the EH could be cured or controlled. Patients on therapeutic regime were gradually withdrawn from drug therapy, and later divided into two groups of 10 each. Group-I (age 34 +/- 1.7 years) was subjected to a 3 week course of 70 degrees head-up tilt for 30 min daily, while in group-II (age 50 +/- 3.3 years), specific yogic exercises equivalent to head-up or head-down tilt were administered for the same duration. The progressive autonomic readjustments were assessed by a battery of tests including cardiovascular responses to head up tilt, cold pressor response at 4 degrees C water (CPR), alpha index of EEG (AI), level of blood catecholamines (CA) and plasma renin activity (PRA). At the end of 3 weeks, there was a significant reduction (P < 0.001) in blood pressure in both the groups. Progressive changes in BP and HR response to tilt during 3 weeks course of tilt and yogic exercise clearly indicated gradual improvement in baroreflex sensitivity. Likewise, changes in other indices like CPR, AI, CA and PRA indicated progressive attenuation of sypatho-adrenal and renin-angiotensin activity. All these changes together with the reduction in BP strongly suggest a close link between the etiology of EH and baroreflexes on the one hand and controlling influence of the latter on sympatho-adrenal and renin-angiotensin systems on the other. It also throws light on the physiological mechanism underlying the effects of selected yogic exercises in the treatment of EH.

Unfortunately the emphasis at present is only on early diagnosis of a disease and its treatment. The modern investigations and treatment has become very costly which a poor man cannot afford. Preventive medicine is less costly. The developing countries have many socio-economic problems of population explosion, poverty, ignorance, illiteracy, shifting of population from rural to urban areas for employment and traffic jams in cities. Rapid industrialization has resulted in indiscriminate cutting of trees and forests and increasing pollution. Under the present circumstances one wonders whether it would be possible to achieve the WHO's object of health for all or will it remain a dream! The role of 'Yoga and Meditation' and vegetarian diet has been recognised world over for maintenance of normal physical and mental health; these help to lessen mental tension in the present competitive world full of stress and strain for all of us. 3-4% of people in the world avail the beneficial effects of alternative system of medicine is complete as each has its own merits and limitations. Hence our aim should be to choose an integrated system of medicine which would help in preventing diseases and treat them early by a safe and effective procedure. In the present political situation in our country none of the parties have announced any definite programme for population control, through it is a grave problem. We will not be able to fulfil our object of reaching our target of Health for all without strict population control major. Unless this programme is undertaken seriously as a priority in a co-ordinated disciplined manner by all of us and completed in a given period of time, the younger generation will not forgive us. We hope that as true citizens of India we will not spare any efforts on our part in attaining this objective for a bright future.	Apte, N K;Kasbekar, V G	1998 Sep

9950067	A 15O-H2O PET study of meditation and the resting state of normal consciousness.	The aim of the present study was to examine whether the neural structures subserving meditation can be reproducibly measured, and, if so, whether they are different from those supporting the resting state of normal consciousness. Cerebral blood flow distribution was investigated with the 15O-H20 PET technique in nine young adults, who were highly experienced yoga teachers, during the relaxation meditation (Yoga Nidra), and during the resting state of normal consciousness. In addition, global CBF was measured in two of the subjects. Spectral EEG analysis was performed throughout the investigations. In meditation, differential activity was seen, with the noticeable exception of V1, in the posterior sensory and associative cortices known to participate in imagery tasks. In the resting state of normal consciousness (compared with meditation as a baseline), differential activity was found in dorso-lateral and orbital frontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyri, left temporal gyri, left inferior parietal lobule, striatal and thalamic regions, pons and cerebellar vermis and hemispheres, structures thought to support an executive attentional network. The mean global flow remained unchanged for both subjects throughout the investigation (39+/-5 and 38+/-4 ml/100 g/min, uncorrected for partial volume effects). It is concluded that the (H2)15O PET method may measure CBF distribution in the meditative state as well as during the resting state of normal consciousness, and that characteristic patterns of neural activity support each state. These findings enhance our understanding of the neural basis of different aspects of consciousness.	Lou, H C;Kjaer, T W;Friberg, L;Wildschiodtz, G;Holm, S;Nowak, M	1999

9846257	Acute traumatic stroke: a case of bow hunter's stroke in a child.	Acute traumatic stroke of the cerebellum is rarely seen in children. In adults, chiropractical manipulation, yoga exercises, bow hunting and cervical trauma have all been associated with vertebrobasillar damage and subsequent stroke due to cerebellar infarction. We present a case of bow hunter's stroke in a child. An 11-year-old boy developed deep coma one day after minor occipital head injury due to an infarct in the left cerebellum and ipsilateral medulla oblongata. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed hypoperfusion of the left vertebral artery and occlusion of the posterior and anterior inferior cerebellar arteries (PICA and AICA respectively).

9820263	Yoga-based intervention for carpal tunnel syndrome: a randomized trial.	CONTEXT: Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common complication of repetitive activities and causes significant morbidity. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of a yoga-based regimen for relieving symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. DESIGN: Randomized, single-blind, controlled trial. SETTING: A geriatric center and an industrial site in 1994-1995. PATIENTS: Forty-two employed or retired individuals with carpal tunnel syndrome (median age, 52 years; range, 24-77 years). INTERVENTION: Subjects assigned to the yoga group received a yoga-based intervention consisting of 11 yoga postures designed for strengthening, stretching, and balancing each joint in the upper body along with relaxation given twice weekly for 8 weeks. Patients in the control group were offered a wrist splint to supplement their current treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes from baseline to 8 weeks in grip strength, pain intensity, sleep disturbance, Phalen sign, and Tinel sign, and in median nerve motor and sensory conduction time. RESULTS: Subjects in the yoga groups had significant improvement in grip strength (increased from 162 to 187 mm Hg; P = .009) and pain reduction (decreased from 5.0 to 2.9 mm; P = .02), but changes in grip strength and pain were not significant for control subjects. The yoga group had significantly more improvement in Phalen sign (12 improved vs 2 in control group; P = .008), but no significant differences were found in sleep disturbance, Tinel sign, and median nerve motor and sensory conduction time. CONCLUSION: In this preliminary study, a yoga-based regimen was more effective than wrist splinting or no treatment in relieving some symptoms and signs of carpal tunnel syndrome.

9777438	Shorter latencies of components of middle latency auditory evoked potentials in congenitally blind compared to normal sighted subjects.	A previous study which reported shorter latencies of the Nb component of AEP-MLRs in congenitally blind compared to normal sighted subjects, formed the basis for the present study. The blind subjects had received a rehabilitation program from the age of 4 years onwards, which may have influenced auditory function. Hence the present study was designed to compare the AEP MLRs of normal sighted subjects with age-matched blind subjects who had not undergone early rehabilitation. Auditory evoked potentials (0 to 100 ms. range) were recorded in 10 congenitally blind subjects (average age = 22.4 +/- 4.9 yrs.) and an equal number of age-matched subjects with normal vision. There were two repetitions per subject. The peak latencies of both the Pa (maximum positive peak between Na and 35 ms.) and Nb (maximum negative peak between 38 and 52 ms.) waves was significantly shorter in congenitally blind compared to normal sighted subjects. Since the Pa and Nb waves are believed to be generated by the superior temporal cortex (Heschl's gyrus), it appears that processing at this neural level occurs more efficiently in the blind. Also, in spite of the absence of an early rehabilitation program the present subjects showed the same auditory changes as those reported earlier.

9773368	Yoga: intuition, preventive medicine, and treatment.	Mind-body fitness programs use a combination of muscular activity and mindful focus on awareness of the self, breath, and energy to promote health. The ancient discipline of yoga includes physical postures and breathing and meditation techniques. Scientific evidence exists about the physiologic effects of yoga. Mind-body fitness programs may offer therapeutic effects different from those offered by traditional body fitness programs.	Collins, C	1998 Sep-Oct
9716279	P300 amplitude and antidepressant response to Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY).	BACKGROUND: There is evidence that Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) has significant antidepressant effects. OBJECTIVE: The present study examined whether pretreatment P300 ERP amplitude predicts antidepressant response to SKY. METHODS: Consenting, drug-free depressed patients (n = 30; dysthymics, 15, melancholics, 15) who received SKY as the sole treatment were assessed clinically at pretreatment, 1 month and 3 months. Auditory P300 was recorded before treatment. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients responded favourably to SKY. The pretreatment P300 amplitude neither distinguished responders and non-responders nor was associated with differential rates of response. DISCUSSION: It is concluded that SKY therapy is uniformly effective regardless of the pretreatment P300 amplitude.

9700792	Differences between congenitally blind and normally sighted subjects in the P1 component of middle latency auditory evoked potentials.	Auditory evoked potentials (0 to 100 msec. range) were recorded two times for 9 congenitally blind children (age = 14.1 yr. +/- 1.4 yr) and 9 age-matched children with normal vision. The groups' peak latency and amplitude of the P1 wave were compared. The peak latency was significantly lower for the congenitally blind than for the normally sighted on a two-factor analysis of variance. Since the P1 wave is thought to correspond to either the ascending reticular activating system or the primary auditory cortex, these results suggest that information processing at these neural levels may occur more efficiently in the blind.

9670875	Moderate-intensity aerobic training improves glucose tolerance in aging independent of abdominal adiposity.	OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that training-related improvements in glucose and insulin responses to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) are independent of changes in abdominal adiposity. DESIGN: Adiposity and responses to an OGTT were measured before and after a 4-month randomized, controlled aerobic training program. SETTING: An academic medical institution. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen healthy older (73+/-1 year) men and women. INTERVENTION: Both the training (T) (n=9) and control (C) (n=7) groups exercised 4 times a week for 60-minute sessions. T exercised on mini-trampolines at 55 to 65% of HRmax (determined from a graded treadmill test) for 1 month and then at 75% for 3 months; C engaged in supervised stretching and yoga. MEASUREMENTS: At baseline and follow-up, we estimated abdominal fat (from computed tomography and anthropometry), plasma glucose, and serum insulin responses to the OGTT and fasting concentrations of free fatty acids (FFA). RESULTS: Aerobic training resulted in a 16% increase in VO2 peak and a 24% decrease in FFA in the T group (P < .05), but training had no effect on abdominal fat. In the T group, the glucose response curve shifted to the left, and the incremental area under the glucose curve decreased by 25% (P < .05). This improvement in glucose response occurred, however, only in those with impaired glucose tolerance at baseline and without any observed change in insulin response. No change in any variables occurred in the C group. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that moderate-intensity aerobic training has a favorable effect on glucose tolerance in older people, independent of changes in abdominal adiposity.

9581321	A review of mind-body therapies in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Part 1: Implications for the elderly.	BACKGROUND: A review of research on complementary and alternative treatments, specifically mind-body techniques, was conducted at Stanford University. The goals of the review were to establish a comprehensive literature review and to provide a rationale for future research concerning successful aging. METHODS: Computerized searches were conducted using MEDLINE, PsychInfo, Stanford Library, Dissertation Abstracts, Lexus-Nexus, the Internet, and interviews conducted with practitioners. All studies since 1990 that examined mind-body treatments of cardiovascular disorders in the elderly were included. Mind-body practices evaluated were social support, cognitive-behavioral treatment, meditation, the placebo effect, hope, faith, imagery, spiritual healing, music therapy, hypnosis, yoga, t'ai chi, qigong and aikido. Studies conducted after 1990 were a priority, but when more recent literature was scarce, other studies using randomized, controlled trials were included. RESULTS: Mind-body techniques were found to be efficacious primarily as complementary and sometimes as stand-alone alternative treatments for cardiovascular disease-related conditions. Studies provided evidence for treatment efficacy, but the need for further controlled research was evident. CONCLUSIONS: Reviewers found only a handful of randomized, controlled research studies conducted in the United States. As a result, there is a lack of replicated studies with which to determine appropriate treatment dosage and the mechanisms by which many of the practices work. Compelling anecdotal evidence, the presence of some controlled research, overall cost effectiveness, and the lack of side effects resulting from mind-body treatments make further investigation a high priority.

9532318	Clinical study of yoga techniques in university students with asthma: a controlled study.	Adult asthmatics, ranging from 19 to 52 years from an asthma and allergy clinic in a university setting volunteered to participate in the study. The 17 students were randomly divided into yoga (9 subjects) and nonyoga control (8 subjects) groups. The yoga group was taught a set of breathing and relaxation techniques including breath slowing exercises (pranayama), physical postures (yogasanas), and meditation. Yoga techniques were taught at the university health center, three times a week for 16 weeks. All the subjects in both groups maintained daily symptom and medication diaries, collected A.M. and P.M. peak flow readings, and completed weekly questionnaires. Spirometry was performed on each subject every week. Analysis of the data showed that the subjects in the yoga group reported a significant degree of relaxation, positive attitude, and better yoga exercise tolerance. There was also a tendency toward lesser usage of beta adrenergic inhalers. The pulmonary functions did not vary significantly between yoga and control groups. Yoga techniques seem beneficial as an adjunct to the medical management of asthma.	Vedanthan, P K;Kesavalu, L N;Murthy, K C;Duvall, K;Hall, M J;Baker, S;Nagarathna, S	1998 Jan-Feb
26868737	The indigenous psychiatry of Ladakh, part II: Narrative and metanarrative in the cultural control of dissociative states in the Himalayas.	In traditional Ladakh (NW India, Tibetan) men are less frequently sufferers from dissociative possession by 'witches' than are women, but they may be possessed by spirits of place, plausibly a consequence of their more outward focus on life beyond the household. Where possession leads to authorisation to practice as an oracle healer the 'afflicted' may gain in social status. Male possession is also induced through ritual meditation (visualisation) in monks destined to function as oracles in monastic festivals which have ancient links with traditional government. In these cases the individuals have usually had considerable experience and training in Buddhist mental yoga and have not experienced an initiatory illness. The metanarrative governing these occasions constrains village narratives as an aspect of social control by Buddhist authorities with a long history in the culture of Tibetan-speaking peoples. The functions of shamanic trance and its parallels in the post-modern West are considered.	Crook, J H	1998 Apr

9513794	Autonomic changes while mentally repeating two syllables--one meaningful and the other neutral.	Autonomic and respiratory variables were recorded in 12 volunteers in three types of sessions (1). Before, during and after a test period of mentally repeating a meaningful syllable 'OM' (MOM session) (2). A similar session except that the test period was spent mentally repeating a neutral work, 'one' (COM session) (3). A session with non-targeted thinking (NT session). The subjects were familiar with both syllables, and had been meditating on 'OM' for 20 days. During the test periods of both MOM and COM sessions the rate of respiration (RR) and heart rate (HR) decreased significantly [(two factor ANOVA (RR), paired t test (RR. HR)]. Compared to the pre period. Mental repetition of 'OM' (but not 'one') caused a significant decrease in skin resistance level (SRL) (paired t test). This was taken to mean that the subject recognized the significance of the syllable. No significant change occurred during NT sessions.	Telles, S;Nagarathna, R;Nagendra, H R	1998 Jan

9475649	Regulation of blood volume during training in post-menopausal women.	UNLABELLED: In younger people the increase in aerobic capacity following training is related, in part, to blood volume (BV) expansion and the consequent improvements in maximal cardiac output. This training-induced hypervolemia is associated with a decrease in cardiopulmonary baroreflex (CPBR) control of peripheral vascular tone. PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that improvement in peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) during training in older women is associated with specific central adaptations, such as BV expansion and a reduction in CPBR control of vascular tone. METHODS: Seventeen healthy older women were randomized into training (N = 9, 71 +/- 2 yr) and control (N = 8, 73 +/- 3 yr) groups. The training group exercised three to four times per wk for 30 min at 60% peak heart rate for 12 wk and then 40-50 min at 75% peak heart rate for 12 wk. The control group participated in yoga exercises over the same time period. We measured resting BV (Evans blue dye), VO2peak, and the forearm vascular resistance response to unloading low pressure mechanoreceptors during low levels of lower body negative pressure (through -20 mm Hg) before and after aerobic training. The slope of the increase in forearm vascular resistance (response) per unit decrease in central venous pressure (stimulus) was used to assess CPBR responsiveness. RESULTS: Aerobic training increased VO2peak 14.2% from 24.2 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1) to 27.7 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1) (P < 0.05), a smaller improvement than typically seen in younger subjects. Blood volume (59.9 +/- 1.9 and 60.9 +/- 1.9 mL x kg[-1]) and CPBR function (-3.98 +/- 0.92 and -3.46 +/- 0.94 units x mm(-1) Hg) were similar before and after training. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the inability to induce adaptations in CPBR function may limit BV expansion during training in older women. In addition, the absence of these specific adaptations may contribute to the relatively poor improvements in VO2peak in older women during short (10-12 wk) periods of training.

9451568	[The use of alternative medicine by multiple sclerosis patients--patient characteristics and patterns of use].	UNLABELLED: The use of alternative medicine is growing in all Western countries. Little is known about the modalities and patterns of use of alternative medicine by patients suffering from multiple sclerosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analysed an anonymous questionnaire that was sent to and answered by 129 former inpatients who had multiple sclerosis diagnosed by typical clinical and laboratory findings. RESULTS: 82 of 129 patients (63.6%) have been using alternative therapies. They were treated with a total of 87 different alternative healing methods or substances. Some patients used up to 9 different methods. The mean duration of the alternative treatment was 2.6 (0-20) years. Most patients used homoeopathy (n = 35), herbs (29 different substances, 32 users), different relaxation methods like yoga (n = 38) and various diets (n = 21). The most important motivation to look for alternative medicine was the aim to participate actively in the healing process. Most patients thought that there was some positive effect from the alternative treatment but did not inform their general practitioner or neurologist about it. DISCUSSION: Like in other chronic diseases many MS-patients use alternative medicine. The experiences of these treatments forms part of the patient's coping with the disease.

9445523	[Changes in body equilibrium response caused by breathing. A posturographic study with visual feedback].	BACKGROUND: Therapeutical methods involving holistic medicine are of increasing interest. The present study deals with the psychophysical breath work by Middendorf and examines whether it has an effect on reactions of the body's equilibrium system. METHODS: Different optical patterns were projected on a video screen to the test subject standing on a modified posturographic platform. Subjects were instructed to shift their center of gravity according to the patterns projected on the video screen. The patterns consisted of a line that had to be followed in the anterior-posterior and in the lateral plane, and of a circle which had to be followed clockwise and counterclockwise. PATIENTS: Three groups each consisting of 17 healthy persons were tested; group 1: advanced in breath training, group 2: beginners in breath training, group 3: no experience in breath work at all. RESULTS: Group 1 und 2 show significantly better results in the posturographic test with visual feedback than subjects without experience in breast work (group 3). Furthermore, posturographic results immediately after one hour of breath work reveal clear improvements in the body equilibrium. CONCLUSIONS: Psychophysical breath work by Middendorf leads to a general improvement of the body equilibrium which is stable over time. The positive results of this study lead to the assumption that breath work by Middendorf is a valuable method for treatment and rehabilitation of balance disorders.	Aust, G;Fischer, K	1997 Oct
9430331	Influence of intensive yoga training on physiological changes in 6 adult women: a case report.	The short-term effects of 4 weeks of intensive yoga practice on physiological responses in six healthy adult female volunteers were measured using the maximal exercise treadmill test. Yoga practice involved daily morning and evening sessions of 90 minutes each. Pre- and post-yoga exercise performance was compared. Maximal work output (Wmax) for the group increased by 21%, with a significantly reduced level of oxygen consumption per unit work but without a concomitant significant change in heart rate. After intensive yoga training, at 154 Wmin(-1) (corresponding to Wmax of the pre-yoga maximal exercise test) participants could exercise more comfortably, with a significantly lower heart rate (p < 0.05), reduced minute ventilation (p < 0.05), reduced oxygen consumption per unit work (p < 0.05), and a significantly lower respiratory quotient (p < 0.05). The implications for the effect of intensive yoga on cardiorespiratory efficiency are discussed, with the suggestion that yoga has some transparently different quantifiable physiological effects to other exercises.

9407753	Knowledge and reported use of sport science by elite New Zealand Olympic class sailors.	OBJECTIVE: This study enquired about the knowledge and reported use of sport science in elite Olympic class sailors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The sailors responded to a simple questionnaire. SETTING: The questionnaire was administered as part of an introductory seminar on sport science during a training camp. PARTICIPANTS: The participants were 28 (22 male, 6 female) elite New Zealand Olympic class sailors. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASURES: The questionnaire asked whether or not they used a training race diary, enquired about their current and past injuries and their knowledge and use of sport science in the areas of nutrition, psychology and physical training. RESULTS: Only ten (36%) of the sailors kept a training/race diary. Whilst only four (14%) had a current injury, sixteen (57%) reported an injury in the previous three years. The injuries were in the lower back (45%), knee (22%), shoulder (18%), and arm (15%). Although nineteen (68%) of the sailors had experienced dehydration during racing, the average volume of fluid reported to be taken on a four hour sail was only 0.9 litre, of which only an average of 0.7 litres (77%) was reported to be drunk. All the sailors reported being sometimes (46%) to very often (3%) anxious before races and sometimes (43%) to always (7%) being frustrated with their own mistakes. Only one sailor reported never having negative thoughts whilst fifteen (53%) reported having them sometimes, and seven (25%) often or very often. Twenty-four (86%) of the sailors reported that they sometimes had a loss of concentration near the end of the race. Whilst eighteen (64%) reported practising relaxation and seventeen (61%) reported practising visualisation as a mental skill, only five (18%) practised progressive mental relaxation, two (7%) practised meditation and none practised yoga. Seventeen (61%) undertook strength/circuit training, ten (36%) flexibility and twenty-one (75%) off water aerobic training. Twenty-four (86%) reported undertaking on-water aerobic training. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that there is considerable scope for improvement in the knowledge and use of sports science amongst elite New Zealand Olympic class sailors.

21494440	Psychophysiological changes at the time of examination in medical students before and after the practice of yoga and relaxation.	The effect of yoga and relaxation changes in psychophysiological parameters in response to the stress of examination in 75 medical students was studied. Initially five parameters (anxiety level, heart rate, blood pressure, galvanic skin resistance and choice reaction time) were recorded, a month before the examination and on the day of examination. Students were then randomly divided into 3 group of 25 each. One group practiced yoga (Group- Y), and another group practiced relaxation (group-R) regularly for three months. The third group was control group (Group-C). All the parameters were recorded after the changes in anxiety level, heart rate, blood pressure, and galvanic skin resistance in response to stress of examination were significantly attenuated and there was significant improvement in choice reaction time in Group-Y and Group-R as compared to Group-C after yoga and relaxation.

9354111	Yoga breathing through a particular nostril increases spatial memory scores without lateralized effects.	Uninostril breathing facilitates the performance on spatial and verbal cognitive tasks, said to be right and left brain functions, respectively. Since hemispheric memory functions are also known to be lateralized, the present study assessed the effects of uninostril breathing on the performance in verbal and spatial memory tests. School children (N = 108 whose ages ranged from 10 to 17 years) were randomly assigned to four groups. Each group practiced a specific yoga breathing technique: (i) right nostril breathing, (ii) left nostril breathing, (iii) alternate nostril breathing, or (iv) breath awareness without manipulation of nostrils. These techniques were practiced for 10 days. Verbal and spatial memory was assessed initially and after 10 days. An age-matched control group of 27 were similarly assessed. All 4 trained groups showed a significant increase in spatial test scores at retest, but the control group showed no change. Average increase in spatial memory scores for the trained groups was 84%. It appears yoga breathing increases spatial rather than verbal scores, without a lateralized effect.	Naveen, K V;Nagarathna, R;Nagendra, H R;Telles, S	1997 Oct

9292858	Seminal truth: a modern science of male celibacy in north India.	Many scholars have noted that brahmacharya (celibacy) is an important concept in Hindu notions of male identity (cf. Kakar 1981, 1982, 1990; Obeyesekere 1976, 1981; for comparison, see Gilmore 1990). Although the psychological basis of this concept has been studied, there is very little in the literature on the "medical mechanics" of being and becoming a brahmachari. Nor is there is a comprehensive account for the precise relationship between sex and the meaning of physical health in modern urban India. Through an examination of the popular Hindi literature on brahmacharya, interpreted within the context of therapeutic celibacy as put in practice by a modern yoga society, this article shows how a discourse about sex, semen, and health is conceived of in terms of embodied truth. Using Foucault's critique of Western sexuality as a contrasting frame of reference, I argue that the "truth" about sex in modern North India is worked out in somatic rather than psychological terms, in which morality is problematically defined by male physiology and gendered conceptions of good health.

9210777	Comparing Hatha yoga with dynamic group psychotherapy for enhancing methadone maintenance treatment: a randomized clinical trial.	BACKGROUND: As more methadone treatment programs are funded in an attempt to curb substance abuse and HIV infection among i.v. drug users, more cost effective treatment approaches are being sought. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether clients in outpatient methadone maintenance treatment who practice weekly Hatha yoga in a group setting experience more favorable treatment outcomes than those who receive conventional group psychodynamic therapy. METHODS: After a 5-day assessment period, 61 patients were randomly assigned to methadone maintenance enhanced by traditional group psychotherapy (ie, conventional methadone treatment) or an alternative Hatha yoga therapy (ie, alternative methadone treatment). Patients were followed for 6 months and evaluated on a variety of psychological, sociological, and biological measures. The revised Symptom Check List provided the primary psychological measures; the Addiction Severity Index provided various indices of addictive behaviors. RESULTS: The evidence revealed that there were no meaningful differences between traditional psychodynamic group therapy and Hatha yoga presented in a group setting. Both treatments contributed to a treatment regimen that significantly reduced drug use and criminal activities. Psychopathology at admission was significantly related to program participation regardless of treatment group. DISCUSSION: In addition to examining the characteristics of patients who present for treatment, this study identifies unexpected staff issues that complicate the integration of alternative and traditional treatment strategies. CONCLUSION: Alternative methadone treatment is not more effective than conventional methadone treatment, as originally hypothesized. However, some patients may benefit more from alternative methadone treatment than conventional methadone treatment. Additional research is necessary to determine characteristics that identify patients who might benefit from alternative methadone treatment.	Shaffer, H J;LaSalvia, T A;Stein, J P	1997 Jul
9285292	Middle latency auditory evoked potentials in congenitally blind and normal sighted subjects.	Middle latency auditory evoked potentials were recorded in two groups of ten subjects each, viz, congenitally blind (CB) and age-matched subjects with normal vision (NV). The age range for both groups was 13 to 16 years. The CB group subjects had peripheral deficits, with absence of visual evoked responses. The peak latency of the Nb wave (the maximum negativity between 38 and 48 ms) was significantly lower in the CB group compared to NV group (p < .05, one-tailed, two factor ANOVA, Tukey test). In addition to these recordings from the vertex, recordings were also made from occipital areas, to test whether the visual cortex contributes to information processing at primary auditory cortical levels in the blind, as was reported in earlier studies on the generation of potentials during auditory selective attention. No such effect was observed. Hence, it appears that in blind subjects changes in generators of auditory middle latency evoked potentials are mainly related to latency, rather than to scalp distribution of these components.

9241991	A therapy to live by: public health, the self and nationalism in the practice of a north Indian yoga society.	In this article I focus on the relationship between concepts of self and health in modern North India. Drawing on field research in a popular yoga society, I argue that yoga therapy, as practiced by the Bharatiya Yog Sansthan of Delhi, provides a reconceptualization of what can be meant by public health. Using studies that challenge both the essentialist and epistemological facticity of the self, I show how the discourse and practice of yoga is implicated in, and derived from, a complex search for self definition in terms of health; health which is conceived of as a public regimen that seeks to reconnect that which modernity has broken apart: mind and body.

9179553	Effects of aerobic exercise training and yoga on the baroreflex in healthy elderly persons.	It is unclear whether the age-associated reduction in baroreflex sensitivity is modifiable by exercise training. The effects of aerobic exercise training and yoga, a non-aerobic control intervention, on the baroreflex of elderly persons was determined. Baroreflex sensitivity was quantified by the alpha-index, at high frequency (HF; 0.15-0.35 Hz, reflecting parasympathetic activity) and mid-frequency (MF; 0.05-0.15 Hz, reflecting sympathetic activity as well), derived from spectral and cross-spectral analysis of spontaneous fluctuations in heart rate and blood pressure. Twenty-six (10 women) sedentary, healthy, normotensive elderly (mean 68 years, range 62-81 years) subjects were studied. Fourteen (4 women) of the sedentary elderly subjects completed 6 weeks of aerobic training, while the other 12 (6 women) subjects completed 6 weeks of yoga. Heart rate decreased following yoga (69 +/- 8 vs. 61 +/- 7 min-1, P < 0.05) but not aerobic training (66 +/- 8 vs. 63 +/- 9 min-1, P = 0.29). VO2 max increased by 11% following yoga (P < 0.01) and by 24% following aerobic training (P < 0.01). No significant change in alpha MF (6.5 +/- 3.5 vs. 6.2 +/- 3.0 ms mmHg-1, P = 0.69) or alpha HF (8.5 +/- 4.7 vs. 8.9 +/- 3.5 ms mmHg-1, P = 0.65) occurred after aerobic training. Following yoga, alpha HF (8.0 +/- 3.6 vs. 11.5 +/- 5.2 ms mmHg-1, P < 0.01) but not alpha MF (6.5 +/- 3.0 vs. 7.6 +/- 2.8 ms mmHg-1, P = 0.29) increased. Short-duration aerobic training does not modify the alpha-index at alpha MF or alpha HF in healthy normotensive elderly subjects. alpha HF but not alpha MF increased following yoga, suggesting that these parameters are measuring distinct aspects of the baroreflex that are separately modifiable.

9355699	Yoga for rehabilitation: an overview.	The use of yoga for rehabilitation has diverse applications. Yoga practice benefited mentally handicapped subjects by improving their mental ability, also the motor co-ordination and social skills. Physically handicapped subjects had a restoration of some degree of functional ability after practicing yoga. Visually impaired children children showed a significant decrease in their abnormal anxiety levels when they practiced yoga for three weeks, while a program of physical activity had no such effect. Socially disadvantaged adults (prisoners in a jail) and children in a remand home showed significant improvement in sleep, appetite and general well being, as well as a decrease in physiological arousal. The practice of meditation was reported to decrease the degree of substance (marijuana) abuse, by strengthening the mental resolve and decreasing the anxiety. Another important area is the application of yoga (and indeed, lifestyle change), in the rehabilitation of patients with coronary artery disease. Finally, the possible role of yoga in improving the mental state and general well being of HIV positive persons and patients with AIDS, is being explored.	Telles, S;Naveen, K V	1997 Apr
9142567	A combination of focusing and defocusing through yoga reduces optical illusion more than focusing alone.	The degree of optical illusion was assessed using standard Muller-Lyer lines in two groups (yoga and control) of thirty subjects each. All subjects were between eighteen and forty two years of age. The difference between the reading at which the lines were actually equal and the reading at which the subject felt them to be equal, was noted as the degree of illusion ("di"). Each subject was assessed at the beginning and end of a month. During the month the yoga group received training in yoga, while the control group carried on with their usual routine. At the end of the month the yoga group showed a significant (two factor ANOVA, Tukey test, P < .001) decrease in the "di" (86%), whereas the control group showed no change. The improvement following yoga could be attributed to the combination of focusing and defocusing involved in yoga practice, as these factors are known to influence the "di". Previous results which mentioned a 79% decrease in "di" with focusing alone, provided a comparison.	Telles, S;Nagarathna, R;Vani, P R;Nagendra, H R	1997 Apr
9142556	Pranayama increases grip strength without lateralized effects.	The present study was conducted to determine whether breathing through a particular nostril has a lateralized effect on hand grip strength. 130 right hand dominant, school children between 11 and 18 yrs of age were randomly assigned to 5 groups. Each group had a specific yoga practice in addition to the regular program for a 10 day yoga camp. The practices were: (1) right-, (2) left-, (3) alternate- nostril breathing (4), breath awareness and (5) practice of mudras. Hand grip strength of both hands was assessed initially and at the end of 10 days for all 5 groups. The right-, left- and alternate-nostril breathing groups had a significant increase in grip strength of both hands, ranging from 4.1% to 6.5%, at the end of the camp though without any lateralization effect. The breath awareness and mudra groups showed no change. Hence the present results suggest that yoga breathing through a particular nostril, or through alternate nostrils increases hand grip strength of both hands without lateralization.

9095454	Mind-body fitness: encouraging prospects for primary and secondary prevention.	In recent years health promotion programs have generated many worthwhile psychologic and physiologic benefits but frequently with less than optimal long-term adherence. Incorporating approaches such as mind-body exercise with existing health promotion and cardiac rehabilitation services can improve self-efficacy and long-term adherence to healthy behaviors as well as improve personal stress management skills. Mind-body exercise couples muscular activity with an internally directed focus so that the participant produces a temporary self-contemplative mental state. This internal focus is in contrast to conventional body-centered aerobic and muscular fitness exercise in which there is little or no mindful component. Research on mind-body exercise programs such as yoga and tai chi reveal they have significant mental and physical value. There also are numerous primary and secondary preventive indications for cardiovascular disease in which mind-body exercise can play a primary or complementary role. Mind-body exercise programs will be a welcome and necessary addition to evolving disease management models that focus on self-care and decreased health care use.	La Forge, R	1997 Apr

9078521	Mindfulness meditation-based stress reduction: experience with a bilingual inner-city program.	This article describes a bilingual mindfulness meditation-based stress reduction program in an inner-city setting. Mindfulness meditation is defined, and the practices of breathing meditation, eating meditation, walking meditation, and mindful yoga are described. Data analysis examined compliance, medical and psychologic symptom reduction, and changes in self-esteem, of English- and Spanish-speaking patients who completed the 8-week Stress Reduction and Relaxation Program at the Community Health Center in Meriden, Conn. Statistically significant decreases in medical and psychologic symptoms and improvement in self-esteem were found. Many program completers reported dramatic changes in attitudes, beliefs, habits, and behaviors. Despite the limitations of the research design, these findings suggest that a mindfulness meditation course can be an effective health care intervention when utilized by English- and Spanish-speaking patients in an inner-city community health center. The article includes a discussion of factors to be considered when establishing a mindfulness meditation-based stress reduction program in a health care setting.	Roth, B;Creaser, T	1997 Mar
9132715	Comparison of changes in autonomic and respiratory parameters of girls after yoga and games at a community home.	The heart rate, breathing rate, and skin resistance were recorded for 20 community home girls (Home group) and for 20 age-matched girls from a regular school (School group). The former group had a significantly higher rate of breathing and a more irregular breath pattern known to correlate with high fear and anxiety, than the School group. Skin resistance was significantly lower in the School group, which may suggest greater arousal, 28 girls of the Home group formed 14 pairs, matched for age and duration of stay in the home. Subjects of a pair were randomly assigned to either yoga or games groups. For the former emphasis was on relaxation and awareness, whereas for the latter increasing physical activity was emphasized. At the end of an hour daily for six months both groups showed a significant decrease in the resting heart rate relative to initial values (Wilcoxon paired-sample rest), and the yoga group showed a significant decrease in breath rate, which appeared more regular but no significant increase in the skin resistance. These results suggest that a yoga program which includes relaxation, awareness, and graded physical activity is a useful addition to the routine of community home children.

9042879	Dynamic analysis of penetrating trauma.	BACKGROUND: Whereas considerable literature exists on the wounding mechanics of high velocity projectiles in the military domain, there is a paucity of such data from projectiles routinely encountered in the civilian population in the United States. This study was undertaken to develop a methodology and to determine the dynamics of penetrating trauma secondary to low velocity projectiles (200-300 m/sec). To demonstrate the feasibility of the methodology and the experimental protocol, two markedly different projectiles were chosen in the study. METHODS: Two projectiles were discharged into a human tissue simulant; one projectile was smooth and the other was of the expansion type. High-speed video photographic analysis and synchronized trigger techniques were used to describe the path of the projectile during its travel within the simulant. The temporal transient and residual profiles demonstrating the "wound involvement" were computed. RESULTS: Results indicated a stark contrast between the two cases. There was a ratio of approximately three-to-one in the maximum wound involvement due to penetration. Transient wave oscillations during penetration and perforation of the projectile from the tissue simulant demonstrated significant differences in amplitudes and time durations. In addition, the residual wound involvement profiles indicated differences in the injury potential. CONCLUSIONS: This study has provided an experimental methodology to delineate the temporal dynamic behavior of penetrating projectiles. To fully quantify and differentiate the dynamic differences in the temporal behaviors of the numerous available projectiles (with various combinations in design, type of equipment, and discharge), further research in this area is clearly necessary. The present protocol lends itself to be used to systematically analyze all these behaviors. Quantified data may assist clinical personnel in the management of penetrating trauma.

Modern Biofeedback Technique is the implementation of psychosomatic interrelationship in respect to health and disease, the psychophysical principle is utilized for psychosomatic self regulation. The basic concept of biofeedback training are well considered in the Vedas, and Yoga system of Indian philosophy. The concept of biofeedback training depends on the ancient philosophical concept of mindbody integration.	Sharma, S	1997 Jan
10225037	Progressive increase in critical flicker fusion frequency following yoga training.	The critical flicker fusion frequency (CFF) is the frequency at which a flickering stimulus is perceived to be steady, with higher values suggesting greater perceptual accuracy. The CFF was measured in two age-matched groups of healthy male volunteers whose ages ranged from 25 to 39 years, with 18 subjects in each group. After baseline assessments one group (yoga group) received yoga training, while the other group (control group) carried on with their routine activities. Yoga practices included asanas, pranayamas, kriyas, meditation, devotional sessions and lectures on the theory of yoga. After 10 days neither group showed a change in CFF. However, at 20 and at 30 days the yoga group showed significant increases in CFF by 11.1% and 14.9%, respectively (two factor ANOVA, Tukey multiple comparison test). The control group showed no change at the day 20 and day 30 followup.	Vani, P R;Nagarathna, R;Nagendra, H R;Telles, S	1997 Jan
9454439	[Who uses alternative medicine and what are the motivations?].	In an increasing degree, unconventional healing methods are used within the orthodox medical system by physicians and in clinics. An even greater variety of methods and settings can be found in the health courses of popular high schools and in private practices of non-medical practitioners. The great interest of medical students in unconventional methods, the prevalence of chronic diseases, and widespread psychospiritual beliefs in the population indicate a growing need for psychosocially based healing approaches and new settings such as weekend-workshops or year long groups. In this article, the sociodemographic data of the users of unconventional methods, their motivations, and their pathways into the informal sector are elaborated by analyzing data from literature and of our own survey among 1135 users of 5 different types of health-related seminars (aerobic, yoga, body-therapies, psychological seminars, spiritual healing).

9401632	Changes in cardiovascular risk factors and hormones during a comprehensive residential three month kriya yoga training and vegetarian nutrition.	In participants of a comprehensive residential three month yoga and mediation training programme living on a low fat lacto-vegetarian diet changes in cardiovascular risk factors and hormones were studied. Substantial risk factor reduction was found. Body mass index, total serum and LDL cholesterol, fibrinogen, and blood pressure were significantly reduced especially in those with elevated levels. Urinary excretion of adrenaline, noradrenaline, dopamine, aldosterone, as well as serum testosterone and luteinizing hormone levels were reduced, while cortisol excretion increased significantly.

9004123	Bone marrow edema caused by altered pedal biomechanics.	OBJECTIVE: To review the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearance of bone marrow edema (BME) and to discuss the applications of this imaging modality in the diagnosis of associated disorders. A case of BME in the foot is also provided to acquaint the reader with how MRI may assist in establishing a differential diagnosis in patients with normal radiographs and clinical findings that suggest osseous injury. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 42-yr-old woman suffered from persistent pain along the dorsum of her foot that worsened with jogging. There was foot pronation and palpable pain and swelling at the third tarsometatarsal joint. An MRI was performed, but it was initially misinterpreted. A second review of the MRI examination established the presence of stress-induced BME adjacent to the articular margins of the third tarsometatarsal joint. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: Medical treatment consisted of a cortisone injection into the left third tarsometatarsal joint, which provided transient relief. Chiropractic treatment included flexible custom orthotics prescribed to specifically address her foot pronation. This was the only chiropractic treatment employed. CONCLUSION: In the presented case, the sensitivity of MRI to stress-induced BME identified the cause of this patient's symptoms and, more importantly, directed management. Because of its ability to demonstrate anatomic and physiologic information, MRI is the ideal imaging modality for assessing suspected injury to the osseous tissues. In patients who relay historical information that suggests chronic or acute osseous injury but demonstrate no radiographic changes to support the clinical suspicion of bony abnormality, an MRI may be indicated to exclude occult injury.

8947332	Unconventional therapies in asthma: an overview.	Acupuncture, homoeopathy, mind-body therapies, and nutritional, herbal, and environmental medicine have all been used in the management of patients with asthma. This paper reviews the evidence base for the use of these unconventional or complementary therapies. Although there is a paucity of large randomized, controlled trials in this area, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that many of these therapies can produce objective and subjective benefit in selected groups of patients. In view of the increasing popularity of complementary medicine among patients and general practitioners, there is now an urgent need for high-quality research to determine how, or whether, these therapies may be interwoven with the more orthodox treatments currently available.

9055100	Study of pulmonary and autonomic functions of asthma patients after yoga training.	"The concept of yoga is helpful for the treatment of Bronchial Asthma", has created a great interest in the medical research field. In order to investigate whether autonomic functions and pulmonary functions are improved in asthma patients after short term yoga training, a study was conducted with nine diagnosed bronchial asthma patients. Yoga training was given for seven days in a camp in Adhyatma Sadhna Kendra, New Delhi. The autonomic function tests to measure the parasympathetic reactivity (Deep Breathing test, Valsalva Manouever), Sympathetic reactivity (Hand Grip test, Cold Pressure test), and pulmonary function tests FVC, FEV1, PEFR, PIF, BHT and CE were recorded before and after yoga training. The resting heart rate after yoga training (P < 0.05) was significantly decreased (89.55 +/- 18.46/min to 76.22 +/- 16.44/min). The sympathetic reactivity was reduced following yoga training as indicated by significant (P < 0.01) reduction in DBP after HGT. There was no change in parasympathetic reactivity. The FVC, FEV1, PEFR did not show any significant change. The PIF (P < 0.01), BHT (P < 0.01) and CE (P < 0.01) showed significant improvement. The results closely indicated the reduction in sympathetic reactivity and improvement in the pulmonary ventilation by way of relaxation of voluntary inspiratory and expiratory muscles. The "comprehensive yogic life style change programme for patients of Bronchial Asthma" have shown significant benefit even within a short period.

8920407	[Health and education: alternative courses for the development of nursing personnel].	To promote therapeutic educational activities for nursing personnel in order to decrease stress, to improve interpersonal relations and the search for self-knowledge are the objectives of the courses promoted by the Departament of Nursing of FCM and by The Continued Education Nursing Service of the University Hospital of UNICAMP. Respiration, relaxation, body sensibilization and awareness, and theater interpretation techniques were taught in the following courses: The Hospital and Human Relations, Dance and Creativity, Yoga and Mental Relaxation. The estrategy employed was "group experience", with the participation of nurse's aides, nurses technicians, practical nurses, and registered nurses during working hours in 15 to 20 meetings per course. "Individual statements" written by the participants were used as a research tool, and the method employed was content analysis. The evaluation demonstrated that the "experience" facilitated relations among the members of the work team, opened the space for effective communication, favored self-knowledge, and helped with the problem solving. The analysis demonstrated the importance of the continuity of alternative courses to help employes improve their relations with themselves, with others and with their work, and to properly value their health/learning.

9062044	Effect of Sahaja yoga practice on seizure control & EEG changes in patients of epilepsy.	The effect of Sahaja yoga meditation on seizure control and electroencephalographic alterations was assessed in 32 patients of idiopathic epilepsy. The subjects were randomly divided into 3 groups. Group I (n = 10) practised Sahaja yoga for 6 months, Group II (n = 10) practised exercises mimicking Sahaja yoga for 6 months and Group III (n = 12) served as the epileptic control group. Group I subjects reported a 62 per cent decrease in seizure frequency at 3 months and a further decrease of 86 per cent at 6 months of intervention. Power spectral analysis of EEG showed a shift in frequency from 0-8 Hz towards 8-20 Hz. The ratios of EEG powers in delta (D), theta (T), alpha (A) and beta (B) bands i.e., A/D, A/D + T, A/T and A + B/D + T were increased. Per cent D power decreased and per cent A increased. No significant changes in any of the parameters were found in Groups II and III, indicating that Sahaja yoga practice brings about seizure reduction and EEG changes. Sahaja yoga could prove to be beneficial in the management of patients of epilepsy.	Panjwani, U;Selvamurthy, W;Singh, S H;Gupta, H L;Thakur, L;Rai, U C	1996 Mar
8833317	Relaxation: mapping an uncharted world.	Nine hundred and forty practitioners of massage, abbreviated progressive muscle relaxation (PMR), yoga stretching, breathing, imagery meditation, and various combination treatments described their technique experiences on an 82-item wordlist. Factor analysis yielded 10 interpretable relaxation categories: Joyful Affects and Appraisals (Joyful), Distant, Calm, Aware, Prayerful, Accepted, Untroubled, Limp, Silent, and Mystery The relaxation response and cognitive/somatic specificity models predict Calm and Limp, which account for only 5.5% of the variance of relaxation experience. Unlike much of previous relaxation research, we found important technique differences. PMR and massage are associated with Distant and Limp; yoga stretching, breathing, and meditation with Aware; meditation with Prayerful and all techniques except PMR with Joyful. Results are consistent with cognitive-behavioral relaxation theory and have implications for relaxation theory, treatment, training, assessment, and research. We close with a revised model of relaxation that posits three global dimensions; tension-relief, passive disengagement, and passive engagement.	Smith, J C;Amutio, A;Anderson, J P;Aria, L A	1996 Mar
8727678	Clinical case report: efficacy of yogic techniques in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorders.	The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical efficacy of yogic techniques in the treatment of eight adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). A specific yogic breathing pattern has been prescribed for the treatment of OCD, as well as others for treating generalized anxiety. A one year course of therapy was followed. Subjects improved on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) comparing baseline with three, six, nine, & 12 month results (one-way ANOVA for repeated measures, F(4,12) = 3.343, p < or = .046). Five patients completed the study (Y-BOCS results were 83%, 79%, 65%, 61% improvement, and one at-18%), group mean improvement of +54%. The Symptoms Checklist-90-R showed significant improvement comparing baseline and 12 months using two-tailed T-tests for OCD (t = 13.856, p < .001), anxiety (t = 3.167, p < .051), and global severity indexes (t = 7.314, p = .005). Perceived Stress Scale scores showed significant improvement for the five test periods (one-way ANOVA for repeated measures, F(4,12) = 9.114, p < or = .001). Five patients were well stabilized on fluoxetine prior to the study, three stopped medication after seven months or less, and two significantly reduced it, one by 25% and the other by 50%. These techniques, merit further study under controlled conditions and could help lead to new approaches for the treatment of OCD and perhaps other impulse control and anxiety-related disorders.

9395677	Physiological measures of right nostril breathing.	This study was conducted to assess the physiological effects of a yoga breathing practice that involves breathing exclusively through the right nostril. This practice is called surya anuloma viloma pranayama (SAV). Twelve volunteers (average age 27.2 years +/- 3.3 years, four males) were assessed before and after test sessions conducted on two consecutive days. On one day the test session involved practicing SAV pranayama for 45 minutes (SAV session). During the test period of the other day, subjects were asked to breathe normally for 45 minutes (NB session). For half the patients (randomly chosen) the SAV session was on the first day and the NB session on the next day. For the remaining six patients, the order of the two sessions was reversed. After the SAV session (but not after the NB) there was a significant (P < .05, paired t test) increase in oxygen consumption (17%) and in systolic blood pressure (mean increase 9.4 mm Hg) and a significant decrease in digit pulse volume (45.7%). The latter two changes are interpreted to be the result of increased cutaneous vasoconstriction. After both SAV and NB sessions, there was a significant decrease in skin resistance (two factor ANOVA, Tukey test). These findings show that SAV has a sympathetic stimulating effect. This technique and other variations of unilateral forced nostril breathing deserve further study regarding therapeutic merits in a wide range of disorders.

8864772	Svara (nostril dominance) and bilateral volar GSR.	The Svara yoga concept of Ida, Pingala and Susumna svara representing rest, active and turbulent states was examined in this study by recording nostril dominance (svara) and bilateral volar GSR (galvanic skin resistance) as an indicator of sympathetic activity under field and laboratory conditions. The sympathetic activity was low in Ida svara, followed by Pingala svara and was maximum in Susumna svara group of subjects under both field and laboratory conditions which agreed with the traditional Svara yoga description. The volar GSR on the right side more readily varied with svara, particularly so in the physically relaxed subjects of laboratory condition than the left volar GSR. The latter observation was worth noting because the subjects were right handed. The right side could be recommended as the standard site for recording volar GSR to closely reflect the sympathetic activity, particularly so when physical rest was given to subjects.

8583800	Soma siddhas and alchemical enlightenment: psychedelic mushrooms in Buddhist tradition.	In the legendary biographies of some Buddhist adepts from the 2nd- and 9th-centuries there are some clues which can be interpreted to reveal that the adepts were consuming psychedelic Amanita muscaria, 'fly agaric', mushrooms to achieve enlightenment. This secret ingredient in the alchemical elixir they used to attain 'realization' was, of course, unnamed, in keeping with their vows to maintain the secrecy of their practices. Its identity was concealed behind a set of symbols, some of which appeared in the Soma symbol system of the Rg Veda, some other symbols possibly passed down from a time of earlier shamanic use of the mushroom in the forests of Northern Eurasia, and some symbols that may be unique to these Buddhist legends. The congruity of these sets of symbols from Northern and Southern Asian traditions will be shown to be reflected in the Germanic tradition in some characteristics of the Oldest God, Odin.

8582759	Autonomic changes during "OM" meditation.	The autonomic and respiratory variables were studied in seven experienced meditators (with experience ranging from 5 to 20 years). Each subject was studied in two types of sessions--meditation (with a period of mental chanting of "OM") and control (with a period of non-targetted thinking). The meditators showed a statistically significant reduction in heart rate during meditation compared to the control period (paired 't' test). During both types of sessions there was a comparable increase in the cutaneous peripheral vascular resistance. Keeping in mind similar results of other authors, this was interpreted as a sign of increased mental alertness, even while being physiologically relaxed (as shown by the reduced heart rate).

7669835	The effects of running and meditation on beta-endorphin, corticotropin-releasing hormone and cortisol in plasma, and on mood.	The relations between three hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, beta-endorphin (beta-EP), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and cortisol, and mood change were examined in 11 elite runners and 12 highly trained mediators matched in age, sex, and personality. Despite metabolic differences between running and meditation, we predicted that mood change after these activities would be similar when associated with similar hormonal change. Compared to pre-test and control values, mood was elevated after both activities but not significantly different between the two groups at post-test. There were significant elevations of beta-EP and CRH after running and of CRH after meditation, but no significant differences in CRH increases between groups. CRH was correlated with positive mood changes after running and mediation. Cortisol levels were generally high but erratic in both groups. We conclude that positive affect is associated with plasma CRH immunoreactivity which itself is significantly associated with circulating beta-EP supporting a role for CRH in the release of beta-EP. Increased CRH immunoreactivity following meditation indicates, however, that physical exercise is not an essential requirement for CRH release.	Harte, J L;Eifert, G H;Smith, R	1995 Jun
8726124	The fourth state of consciousness: the Thuriya Avastha.	Present day neurophysiology stops with attributing thinking processes as the highest level of function of the brain. It has been common knowledge to oriental thinkers for many centuries, that there are many further states of the human mind, culminating in the state of thoughtless awareness; the fourth state of consciousness. This state must have a physiological basis. The complicated structure of the brain, the extravagant abundance of neural and glial elements in the brain, the infinite possibilities of synaptic junctions and synaptic transmission, and the multitude of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators; all these point to the definite possibility of a much greater level of performance and achievement for the human brain than has been apparent so far. Not only the theories but also the experience of Eastern seers have shown that the brain can transcend the boundaries of logic and reason, and experience states of awareness, commonly unrecognized. In the past few decades, knowledge about the functioning of the human brain has been growing exponentially and scientists of diverse disciplines are concentrating on unraveling its mysteries. It is necessary for scientists to investigate this state with all available tools and find the neurophysiological basis of this state.	Ramamurthi, B	1995 May
7649463	Three-year follow-up and clinical implications of a mindfulness meditation-based stress reduction intervention in the treatment of anxiety disorders.	A previous study of 22 medical patients with DSM-III-R-defined anxiety disorders showed clinically and statistically significant improvements in subjective and objective symptoms of anxiety and panic following an 8-week outpatient physician-referred group stress reduction intervention based on mindfulness meditation. Twenty subjects demonstrated significant reductions in Hamilton and Beck Anxiety and Depression scores postintervention and at 3-month follow-up. In this study, 3-year follow-up data were obtained and analyzed on 18 of the original 22 subjects to probe long-term effects. Repeated measures analysis showed maintenance of the gains obtained in the original study on the Hamilton [F(2,32) = 13.22; p < 0.001] and Beck [F(2,32) = 9.83; p < 0.001] anxiety scales as well as on their respective depression scales, on the Hamilton panic score, the number and severity of panic attacks, and on the Mobility Index-Accompanied and the Fear Survey. A 3-year follow-up comparison of this cohort with a larger group of subjects from the intervention who had met criteria for screening for the original study suggests generalizability of the results obtained with the smaller, more intensively studied cohort. Ongoing compliance with the meditation practice was also demonstrated in the majority of subjects at 3 years. We conclude that an intensive but time-limited group stress reduction intervention based on mindfulness meditation can have long-term beneficial effects in the treatment of people diagnosed with anxiety disorders.

7649596	Effect of Sahaja yoga practice on stress management in patients of epilepsy.	An attempt was made to evaluate the effect of Sahaja yoga meditation in stress management in patients of epilepsy. The study was carried out on 32 patients of epilepsy who were rendomly divided into 3 groups: group I subjects practised Sahaja yoga meditation for 6 months, group II subjects practised postural exercises mimicking Sahaja yoga and group III served as the epileptic control group. Galvanic skin resistance (GSR), blood lactate and urinary vinyl mandelic acid (U-VMA) were recorded at 0, 3 and 6 months. There were significant changes at 3 & 6 months as compared to 0 month values in GSR, blood lactate and U-VMA levels in group I subjects, but not in group II and group III subjects. The results indicate that reduction in stress following Sahaja yoga practice may be responsible for clinical improvement which had been earlier reported in patients who practised Sahaja yoga.

7595873	The management of chronic tinnitus--comparison of a cognitive-behavioural group training with yoga.	Two non-medical treatment strategies for chronic idiopathic tinnitus were evaluated in a randomized control group design. A cognitive-behavioural tinnitus coping training (TCT) was developed and compared to yoga and a self-monitoring control condition. Forty-three chronic tinnitus patients, were assessed at baseline, directly after therapy, and at 3 months follow-up. For evaluation, differential psychoacoustic variables were registered, a tinnitus diary as well as the Tinnitus Questionnaire and different measures of general well-being were used. Statistical analyses showed effects favouring the TCT treatment in comparison to the control and yoga treatment. The TCT-treated patients reported more satisfaction with the training than the yoga group. Participants in the self-monitoring control group were treated either by TCT or yoga after a waiting period. The outcome in this group was even better than in the experimental groups while yoga again showed rather poor effects.

7638421	[Respiratory re-training in asthma. Theoretical basis and results].	The treatment of asthma is medical. The prescription of respiratory physiotherapy should not be routine. It only appears to be indicated in asthmatics with continuous dyspnoea or hypersecretion who are unstable, despite medical treatment which is both correctly prescribed and properly taken. Bronchial drainage, on condition that certain technical precautions are taken, is only useful in asthma with hypersecretion. Asthmatic crises are not relieved by physiotherapy. Standard respiratory exercises could have a certain value on hyperinflation in the chronic asthma of childhood. They are generally without effect on airways resistance or expiratory flow. Likewise, there are reflex massages for relaxation, posture, and respiratory exercises which are borrowed from yoga. Techniques for correction of posture, used preventively, are only of value in chronic asthma of childhood. Respiratory muscle training, in spite of a few successes, is not justified on a theoretical basis, at least in those subjects who have not been subjected to long-term steroid therapy. Overall, exercise training is useful from both the physiological and the psychological point of view. The anaerobic threshold would seem to be the ideal level of intensity for exercise on the basis of 30 minutes, three times a week for subjects who are moderately or severely affected. The rest on condition of certain precautions, can participate in the sport of their choice (or more or less) without any training in the medical milieu beforehand. However, in a minority of these patients the physiotherapists, by their individualised approach and their techniques, sometimes represent a useful transition towards participating in sports. There is no cost benefit study available.	Vandevenne, A	1995

7699639	Evaluation of a yoga based regimen for treatment of osteoarthritis of the hands.	OBJECTIVE: Yoga and relaxation techniques have traditionally been used by nonmedical practitioners to help alleviate musculoskeletal symptoms. The objective of this study was to collect controlled observations of the effect of yoga on the hands of patients with osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: Patients with OA of the hands were randomly assigned to receive either the yoga program or no therapy. Yoga techniques were supervised by one instructor once/week for 8 weeks. Variables assessed were pain, strength, motion, joint circumference, tenderness, and hand function using the Stanford Hand Assessment questionnaire. RESULTS: The yoga treated group improved significantly more than the control group in pain during activity, tenderness and finger range of motion. Other trends also favored the yoga program. CONCLUSION: This yoga derived program was effective in providing relief in hand OA. Further studies are needed to compare this with other treatments and to examine longterm effects.

21743694	Role of yoga in the treatment of neurotic disorders: current status and future directions.	A large number of studies have consistently demonstrated the potential of yoga, not only in the treatment of psychiatric and psychosomatic disorder but also in promoting positive physical and mental health. This paper reviews various studies on the treatment of neurosis with techniques derived from yoga. A few lacunae have been identified and possible directions for future research are outlined. It is hoped that research along these lines will develop a standardized method of yoga therapy which can be utilized and integrated within the existing methods of treatment of neurotic disorders.

7876041	EEG changes during forced alternate nostril breathing.	The effects of 10 min forced alternate nostril breathing (FANB) on EEG topography were studied in 18 trained subjects. One type of FANB consisted in left nostril inspiration and right nostril expiration and the other type in right nostril inspiration and left nostril expiration. Mean power in the beta bands and partially in the alpha band increased during FANB irrespective of the type of nostril breathing. In addition, hemisphere asymmetry in the beta 1 band decreased in the second half of FANB suggesting that FANB has a balancing effect on the functional activity of the left and right hemisphere.

7923324	[Alcohol and drugs in Central Europe--problems and possible solutions].	The high alcohol consumption and increasing abuse of other addictive inducing substances in Central Europe calls for broadley conceived preventive programmes and cheap and widely applicable therapeutic strategies (early treatment at the first contact level, self-help manuals, self-aid organizations). Social instability along with greater availability of alcohol and drugs create a dangerous combination. In addition to strategies of stress prevention at the societal level also strategy at the individual level is important (e.g. relaxation training, yoga, psychotherapy). It is also important to change the "image" of western society and commercial interests of those who make profits on alcohol and drugs should be under control and advertising should be greatly restricted if not prohibited. Prevention of problems caused by alcohol and drugs in particular in youths must be combined and really effective strategies should be used such as peer programmes. The authors mention also their own preventive programme FIT IN and print materials oriented specifically on certain population groups.	Nespor, K;Cs emy, L	1994 Aug 22

7927562	Comparison of effects of yoga & physical exercise in athletes.	The effect of pranayama a controlled breathing practice, on exercise tests was studied in athletes in two phases; sub-maximal and maximal exercise tests. At the end of phase I (one year) both the groups (control and experimental) achieved significantly higher work rate and reduction in oxygen consumption per unit work. There was a significant reduction in blood lactate and an increase in P/L ratio in the experimental group, at rest. At the end of phase II (two years), the oxygen consumption per unit work was found to be significantly reduced and the work rate significantly increased in the experimental group. Blood lactate decreased significantly at rest in the experimental group only. Pyruvate and pyruvate-lactate ratio increased significantly in both the groups after exercise and at rest in the experimental group. The results in both phases showed that the subjects who practised pranayama could achieve higher work rates with reduced oxygen consumption per unit work and without increase in blood lactate levels. The blood lactate levels were significantly low at rest.	Raju, P S;Madhavi, S;Prasad, K V;Reddy, M V;Reddy, M E;Sahay, B K;Murthy, K J	1994 Aug

7937658	[Long-term effects of breathing exercises and yoga in patients with bronchial asthma].	To compare the effects of breathing exercises (BE) or Yoga (Y) on the course of bronchial asthma we studied 36 subjects with a mild disease. The patients were randomly divided into 3 groups. 2 of them participated in a 3 weeks training program of BE or Y while the third group rested without any additional treatment (control group, C). At the end of the training period the patients were asked to practise BE or Y on their own. Drug therapy and lung function parameters before and after a beta 2-agonist metered dose inhaler (albuterol, ALB) were recorded prior to the training program and in 4 weeks intervals for 4 months thereafter. The response to the beta 2-agonist was documented continuously in 28 patients. The mental state of the patients was elucidated by questionnaires.--Prior to the study a significant effect of inhaled ALB on the FEV1 was shown without any significant between group differences. Both, BE and Y, caused a significant amelioration of the mental state but only the BE induced a significant improvement of lung function parameters compared to the individual baseline values. The FEV1 increased significantly by 356.3 +/- 146.2 ml (p < 0.05) and the VC by 225.0 +/- 65.5 ml (p < 0.01). These long-term changes were not significantly different from the actual response to ALB. BE decreased the RV significantly by 306.3 +/- 111.6 ml (p < 0.05), an effect significantly higher compared to the beta 2-agonist (p < 0.01). BE in combination with ALB caused an additive effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	Fluge, T;Richter, J;Fabel, H;Zysno, E;Weller, E;Wagner, T O	1994 Jul
8195575	Nursing diagnosis and natural therapies. A symbiotic relationship.	Work with nursing diagnosis has provided a classification system for what nursing does and has helped to focus nursing interventions to include more independent nursing care. Natural therapies (an umbrella term covering the many healing and health promotion modalities, traditional and modern, that do not use prescription pharmaceuticals or surgery) are among the more independent care modalities available to nursing. Accepted nursing interventions cover a growing number of practices, such as progressive relaxation, guided imagery, yoga, therapeutic touch, music therapy, active listening, aromatherapy, reflexology, advocacy, and centered presence. Most of these nursing interventions would seem to fit comfortably within the realm of natural therapies. As the illness-healing paradigms shift and converge, and the concept of holism rises more and more to the fore, the role of the nurse is shifting from caregiver to healer. Nursing diagnosis, as a classification system for nursing phenomena, can serve as a mechanism to enhance visibility of this healing role of the nurse.	Daniels, G J;McCabe, P	1994 Jun
8055598	[Approaches in the treatment of pathologic gambling].	In the treatment of pathological gambling the diagnosis, treatment of the accessory psychopathology and the somatic condition are important. Motivation training, behavioural and reality-oriented therapy, modification of the lifestyle relaxation techniques and yoga proved useful. There is also experience with dynamically oriented treatment techniques self-esteem reinforcement, training of social skills, strategies which promote impulse control, artetherapy, group therapy, provision of relevant information etc. Family therapy is important both for a pathological gambler and his/her relatives. Very important is contact with the family of the pathological gambler for his own treatment and with regard to the needs of his/her relatives. A therapeutic approach common abroad is participation in a self-help group, Gamblers Anonymous.	Nespor, K	1994 Jun

8039950	Effect of yogic exercises on thyroid function in subjects resident at sea level upon exposure to high altitude.	Using radioactive iodine, the effect of 1 month's yogic exercises has been investigated on the thyroid function of subjects resident at sea level (SL) specially after their exposure to high altitude (HA). The results have been compared with a group of SL subjects who underwent physical training (PT) exercises for the same duration. Ten healthy male volunteers in the age range of 20-30 years were used as test subjects in this study with each serving as his own control. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups of 5 each. One group practised hatha yogic exercises, while the other group performed the regular PT exercises. The thyroidal accumulation and release of radioactive iodine have been measured in each of the subjects of both groups before and after 1 month of their respective exercises at SL. One month of yogic exercises at SL has been observed to cause a significant reduction in the trans-thyroidal availability of radioiodine. The thyroid radioactivity in this group of subjects was always below normal levels with the exception of two peaks of radioactive iodine uptake, when the levels of radioactivity in the thyroid were similar to the control values of pre-yogic exercises. The release of radiolabel at 24-48 h was significantly increased after yogic exercises. In contrast, the subjects performing PT exercises for the same duration at SL showed significant thyroid uptake of radioactive iodine at 24 h. Subsequently their 131I uptake continued to rise slowly until 72 h without any demonstrable thyroidal release of radiolabel. This indicated that increased thyroid activity was induced by conventional PT exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	Rawal, S B;Singh, M V;Tyagi, A K;Selvamurthy, W;Chaudhuri, B N	1994 May
8063362	Plasticity of motor control systems demonstrated by yoga training.	The static motor performance was tested in two groups with 20 subjects in each (age range 17 to 22 years, and 5 females in each group). Tests were carried out at the beginning and end of a 10 day period. The test required being able to insert and hold a metal stylus within holes of varying sizes for 15 sec. Accidental contacts between the stylus and the sides of the holes, were registered on a counter as errors. During the 10 days one group (the yoga group) practised asanas (physical postures), pranayama (voluntary regulation of breathing), meditation, devotional sessions, and tratakas (visual focussing exercises). The control group followed their usual routine. At the end of 10 days the yoga group showed a significant reduction in number of errors (Wilcoxon paired signed ranks test), while the control group did not change. Our earlier study showed a similar improvement in children (9-13 years). It was interesting to note the same degree of plasticity in motor control systems in young adults. The implications for rehabilitation programmes have been discussed.	Telles, S;Hanumanthaiah, B H;Nagarathna, R;Nagendra, H R	1994 Apr
8063359	Breathing through a particular nostril can alter metabolism and autonomic activities.	There is increasing interest in the fact that breathing exclusively through one nostril may alter the autonomic functions. The present study aimed at checking whether such changes actually do occur, and whether breathing is consciously regulated. 48 male subjects, with ages ranging from 25 to 48 years were randomly assigned to different groups. Each group was asked to practice one out of three pranayamas (viz. right nostril breathing, left nostril breathing or alternate nostril breathing). These practices were carried out as 27 respiratory cycles, repeated 4 times a day for one month. Parameters were assessed at the beginning and end of the month, but not during the practice. The 'right nostril pranayama' group showed a significant increase, of 37% in baseline oxygen consumption. The 'alternate nostril' pranayama group showed an 18% increase, and the left nostril pranayama group also showed an increase, of 24%. This increase in metabolism could be due to increased sympathetic discharge to the adrenal medulla. The 'left nostril Pranayama' group showed an increase in volar galvanic skin resistance, interpreted as a reduction in sympathetic nervous system activity supplying the sweat glands. These results suggest that breathing selectively through either nostril could have a marked activating effect or a relaxing effect on the sympathetic nervous system. The therapeutic implications of being able to alter metabolism by changing the breathing pattern have been mentioned.	Telles, S;Nagarathna, R;Nagendra, H R	1994 Apr
8088187	Psychophysiological reactions associated with qigong therapy.	Qigong as a part of the traditional Chinese medicine is similar to western "meditation", Indian "Yoga" or Japanese "Zen", which can all be included in the category of traditional psychotherapy. A series of physiological and psychological effects occur in the course of Qigong training, but inappropriate training can lead to physical and mental disturbances. Physiological effects include changes in EEG, EMG, respiratory movement, heart rate, skin potential, skin temperature and finger tip volume, sympathetic nerve function, function in stomach and intestine, metabolism, endocrine and immunity systems. Psychological effects are motor phenomena and perceptual changes: patients experienced warmness, chilliness, itching sensation in the skin, numbness, soreness, bloatedness, relaxation, tenseness, floating, dropping, enlargement or constriction of the body image, a sensation of rising to the sky, falling off, standing upside down, playing on the swing following respiration, circulation of the intrinsic Qi, electric shock, formication, during Qigong exercise. Some patients experienced dreamland illusions, unreality and pseudohallucination. These phenomena were transient and vanished as the exercise terminated. Qigong deviation syndrome has become a diagnostic term and is now used widely in China.	Xu, S H	1994 Mar

8132240	Energy expenditure and ventilatory responses during Siddhasana--a yogic seated posture.	Reports of energy expenditure and ventilatory responses to yogic seated posture of Siddhasana are lacking in literature. Various cardio-ventilatory responses were studied in states of the horizontal supine, chair-sitting and Siddhasana. It was observed that sitting in Siddhasana posture was characterised by greater minute ventilation, larger tidal volume, higher oxygen consumption, greater CO2 elimination, higher heart frequency greater oxygen pulse and lesser as compared with other two postures. These observations suggest that Siddhasana is a mild type of exercise and may have its application in conditions of low cardio-respiratory reserves especially in individuals in whom heavy exercises are contra-indicated.

7843867	Physiological and psychological effects of Hatha-Yoga exercise in healthy women.	Hatha-Yoga has become increasingly popular in western countries as a method for coping with stress. However, little is known about the physiological and psychological effects of yoga practice. We measured heart rate, blood pressure, the hormones cortisol, prolactin and growth hormone and certain psychological parameters in a yoga practicing group and a control group of young female volunteers reading in a comfortable position during the experimental period. There were no substantial differences between the groups concerning endocrine parameters and blood pressure. The course of heart rate was significantly different, the yoga group had a decrease during the yoga practice. Significant differences between both groups were found in psychological parameters. In the personality inventory the yoga group showed markedly higher scores in life satisfaction and lower scores in excitability, aggressiveness, openness, emotionality and somatic complaints. Significant differences could also be observed concerning coping with stress and the mood at the end of the experiment. The yoga group had significant higher scores in high spirits and extravertedness.	Schell, F J;Allolio, B;Schonecke, O W	1994
8132419	The effects of unilateral forced nostril breathing on cognitive performance.	This study describes the effects of 30 minutes of unilateral forced nostril breathing on cognitive performance in 51 right-handed undergraduate psychology students (25 males and 26 females). A verbal analogies task modeled after the Miller Analogies and SAT Tests was used as a test of left-hemispheric performance and mental rotation tasks based on the Vandenburg and Kuse adaptation of Shepard and Metzler's tests were used as spatial tasks for testing right-hemispheric performance. Spatial task performance was significantly enhanced during left nostril breathing in both males and females, p = .028. Verbal task performance was greater during right nostril breathing, but not significantly p = .14. These results are discussed in comparison to other cognitive and physiological studies using unilateral forced nostril breathing. This yogic breathing technique may have useful application in treating psychophysiological disorders with hemispheric imbalances and disorders with autonomic abnormalities.

8132418	The effects of unilateral forced nostril breathing on the heart.	Three experiments are described that employ impedance cardiography to monitor the effects of unilateral forced nostril breathing (UFNB) on the heart. Experiment 1 includes 7 subjects (4 males, 3 females) with a respiratory rate of 6 breaths/min (BPM). Experiment 2 includes 16 trials using one subject to examine the intraindividual variability, at 6 BPM. Experiment 3 includes 10 trials with the same subject in experiment 2, but with a respiratory rate of 2-3 breaths/s. This rapid rate of respiration is a yogic breathing technique called "breath of fire" or "kapalabhatti" and employs a very shallow but rapid breath in which the abdominal region acts like a bellows. All 3 experiments demonstrated that right UFNB increases heart rate (HR) compared to left. Experiment 1 gave 7 negative slopes, or lowering in HR with left nostril breathing and 7 positive slopes, or increases in HR with right nostril breathing, p = .001. The second and third experiments showed differences in HR means in which right UFNB increases HR more than left, p = .013, p = .001, respectively. In experiment 2 stroke volume was higher with left UFNB, p = .045, compensating for lower HR. Left UFNB increased end diastolic volume as measured in both experiments 1 and 2, p = .006, p = .001, respectively. These results demonstrate a unique unilateral effect on sympathetic stimulation of the heart that may have therapeutic value.	Shannahoff-Khalsa, D S;Kennedy, B	1993 Nov

8112782	Physiological changes in sports teachers following 3 months of training in Yoga.	1. This report shows that in a group of 40 physical education teachers who already had an average of 8.9 years physical training, 3 months of yogic training produced significant improvement in general health (in terms of body weight and BP reduction and improved lung functions). 2. There was also evidence of decreased autonomic arousal and more of psychophysiological relaxation (heart rate and respiratory rate reduction), and improved somatic steadiness (decreased errors in the steadiness test). 3. The changes at the end of 3 months in volar GSR in different directions (increase/decrease/no change), depending on the initial values, suggests that practising yoga may help to bring about a balance in different autonomic functions, so that functioning is optimised.

8244842	Autonomic changes in Brahmakumaris Raja yoga meditation.	This report presents the changes in various autonomic and respiratory variables during the practice of Brahmakumaris Raja yoga meditation. This practice requires considerable commitment and involves concentrated thinking. 18 males in the age range of 20 to 52 years (mean 34.1 +/- 8.1), with 5-25 years experience in mediation (mean 10.1 +/- 6.2), participated in the study. Each subject was assessed in three test sessions which included a period of meditation, and also in three control (non-mediation) sessions, which included a period of random thinking. Group analysis showed that the heart rate during the meditation period was increased compared to the preceding baseline period, as well as compared to the value during the non-meditation period of control sessions. In contrast to the change in the heart rate, there was no significant change during meditation, for the group as a whole, in palmar GSR, finger plethysmogram amplitude, and respiratory rate. On an individual basis, changes which met the following criteria were noted: (1), changes which were greater during meditation (compared to its preceding baseline) than changes during post meditation or non-meditation periods (also compared to their preceding baseline); (2), Changes which occurred consistently during the three repeat sessions of a subject and (3), changes which exceeded arbitrarily-chosen cut-off points (described at length below). This individual level analysis revealed that changes in autonomic variables suggestive of both activation and relaxation occurred simultaneously in different subdivisions of the autonomic nervous system in a subject. Apart from this, there were differences in patterns of change among the subjects who practised the same meditation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	Telles, S;Desiraju, T	1993 Sep
8266199	Evaluation of yoga therapy programme for patients of bronchial asthma.	A study of the effect of yoga therapy programme on 46 indoor patients of chronic bronchial asthma on exercise capacity, pulmonary functions and blood gases was conducted. Exercise capacity was measured by 3 tests: (i) 12 min walk test (12-md); (ii) physical fitness index (PFI) by modified Harvard step test; and (iii) Exercise-Liability index (ELI). Yoga therapy programme resulted in a significant increase in the pulmonary functions and exercise tolerance. A one-year follow-up study showed a good to fair response with reduced symptoms score and drug requirements in these subjects. It is concluded that yoga therapy is beneficial for bronchial asthma.

8276501	Body composition, cardiovascular endurance and anaerobic power of yogic practitioner.	Forty male high school students, age 12-15 yrs, participated for a study of yoga in relation to body composition, cardiovascular endurance and anaerobic power. Ths Ss were placed into two subsets viz., yoga group and control group. Body composition, cardiovascular endurance anaerobic power were measured using standard method. The duration of experiment was one year. The result of ANCOVA revealed that a significant improvement in ideal body weight, body density, cardiovascular endurance and anaerobic power was observed as a result of yoga training. This study could not show significant change in body fat (midaxillary), skeletal diameters and most of the body circumferences. It was evident that some of the fat-folds (tricep, subscapular, suprailiac, umbilical, thigh and calf) and body circumferences (waist, umbilical and hip) were reduced significantly.

Fifty-nine postmyocardial infarction patients received combined therapy involving chemotherapy, physiotherapy, therapeutic exercises and yoga therapy. Thirty-seven controls received the same treatment without yoga exercise. The yoga complex implied elementary simple positions, relaxation exercise and respiratory exercise. A clinical response evident in both the groups appeared more pronounced in the test group as shown by marked improvement in external respiration and blood counts, in exercise tolerance and psychosomatic condition of the patients.

8337075	Improvement in static motor performance following yogic training of school children.	Two groups of 45 children each, whose ages ranged from 9 to 13 years, were assessed on a steadiness test, at the beginning and again at the end of a 10-day period during which one group received training in yoga, while the other group did not. The steadiness test required insertion of and holding for 15 sec. a metal stylus without touching the sides of holes of decreasing sizes in a metal plate. The contacts were counted as 'errors'. During the 10-day period, one group (the 'Yoga' group) received training in special physical postures (asanas), voluntary regulation of breathing (Pranayama), maintenance of silence, as well as visual focussing exercises (tratakas) and games to improve the attention span and memory. The other group (control) carried out their usual routine. After 10 days, the 'Yoga' group showed a significant (Wilcoxon's paired signed-ranks test) decrease in errors, whereas the 'control' group showed no change.

8505745	Mood change and perceptions of vitality: a comparison of the effects of relaxation, visualization and yoga.	The effects of three different procedures, relaxation, visualization and yogic breathing and stretch (pranayama) on perceptions of physical and mental energy and on positive and negative mood states have been assessed in a group of normal volunteers (N = 71, age range 21-76). Pranayama produced a significantly greater increase in perceptions of mental and physical energy and feelings of alertness and enthusiasm than the other two procedures (P < 0.5). Relaxation made subjects significantly more sleepy and sluggish immediately after the session than pranayama (P < 0.05). Visualization made them more sluggish but less content than pranayama (P < 0.05) and more upset than relaxation after the second session (P < 0.05). Thus, a 30 min programme of yogic stretch and breathing exercises which is simple to learn and which can be practised even by the elderly had a markedly 'invigorating' effect on perceptions of both mental and physical energy and increased high positive mood. A more extensive investigation is planned to establish whether such a programme can readily be incorporated into everyday life, and with what long-term results.	Wood, C	1993 May
8340237	Alterations of auditory middle latency evoked potentials during yogic consciously regulated breathing and attentive state of mind.	Middle latency auditory-evoked potentials (AEP-MLRs) of 10 healthy male subjects in the age range of 21-33 years, were assessed to determine whether yogic pranayamic practice would cause changes in them. The pranayama type assessed here is an exercise of consciously-controlled rhythmic breathing involving timed breath-holding in each cycle of breathing, while the subject holds utmost attention and experiences the touch of inhaled air in the nasal passage. The results revealed that the Na-wave amplitude increased and latency decreased during the period of pranayamic practice, whereas the Pa-wave was not significantly altered. The change is interpreted as an indication of a generalized alteration cause in information processing at the primary thalamo-cortical level during the concentrated mental exercise of inducing modifications in neural mechanisms regulating a different functional system (respiratory). Further researches are required to understand the operational significances of such changes.	Telles, S;Joseph, C;Venkatesh, S;Desiraju, T	1993 May
24271221	Yogicchakra symbols: Mirrors of the human mind/heart.	This paper describes the classical understanding of the system ofchakras, or centers of spiritual energy, in tantric yoga. Eachchakra is presented in terms of its traditional understanding. Each is also discussed in the light of contemporary psychological stage theories of development, showing that thechakras can be seen as a model of spiritual development. The preoccupations, concerns, and attitudes associated with eachchakra are portrayed as a mirror of the human mind/heart when spiritual energy is concentrated at that location.	Meadow, M J	1993 Mar

8472621	A study of response pattern of non-insulin dependent diabetics to yoga therapy.	Changes in blood glucose and glucose tolerance by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) after 40 days of yoga therapy in 149 non-insulin-dependent diabetics (NIDDM) were investigated. The response to yoga in these subjects was categorized according to a severity scale index (SSI) based on area index total (AIT) under OGTT curve. One hundred and four patients showed a fair to good response to the yoga therapy. There was a significant reduction in hyperglycemia and AIT with decrease in oral hypoglycemia and AIT with decrease in oral hypoglycemic drugs required for maintenance of normoglycemia. It is concluded that yoga, a simple and economical therapy, may be considered a beneficial adjuvant for NIDDM patients.	Jain, S C;Uppal, A;Bhatnagar, S O;Talukdar, B	1993 Jan
8449544	Energy expenditure and ventilatory responses during Virasana--a yogic standing posture.	Energy expenditure and ventilatory responses to yogic standing posture of Virasana were studied on 10 healthy men (25-37 years of age). The results of various responses respectively to the horizontal supine, Chair-sitting and Virasana were: Minute Ventilation (VE) 7.64, 8.61 and 18.67 L/min; Respiratory Frequency (FR) 15.71, 15.70 and 21.45 Breath/min; Tidal Volume (VT) 0.496, 0.544 and 0.827 L/min; Oxygen consumption (VO2) 0.127, 0.234 and 0.573 L/min; Carbondioxide Elimination (VCO2) 0.127, 0.134 and 0.420 L/min; Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) 0.58, 0.57 and 0.69; Heart Frequency (FH) 65.2, 74.5 and 104.4 beats/min; Oxygen Pulse (O2P) 3.32, 3.17 and 5.45 ml/beat; Ventilatory Equivalent (VE-EQ) 36.78, 37.12 and 33.85; Multiple of Resting VO2 (METS) 0.96, 1.05 and 2.53 and Metabolic Cost (MC) 1.04, 1.13 and 2.76 Cal/min. Virasana posture was characterised by higher VE, FR, VT, VO2, VCO2, FH and O2P with lesser VE-EQ. The observations suggest that Virasana induces temporarily a hypermetabolic state characterised by enhanced sympathetic nervous system activity which gets inhibited during the adoption of resting supine shavasana posture.

8219823	Standard and alternative adjunctive treatments in cardiac rehabilitation.	Cardiovascular rehabilitation is the process of restoring functional abilities degraded by a serious cardiovascular event or by a surgical procedure to preempt such an event. Cardiovascular rehabilitation also includes attempts to reverse risk factors that have contributed initially to the disease process. Rehabilitation programs generally comprise disease-related educational components, supervised prescriptive physical exercise, diet counseling and modification, cessation of tobacco use, psychoeducational interventions aimed at adjustment and coping, and relaxation and stress management to lower nonexertion-related sympathetic drive. The presence of so-called coronary-prone behavior patterns can be detected, and special behavioral modifications may be indicated to mitigate these putative risk factors. This paper reviews the roles of these behavioral adjuncts in treating cardiovascular disease and its aftermath, and notes new and unusual approaches to these components of treatment, such as alternative exercises, biofeedback, yoga, and other relaxation methods. Barriers to compliance are acknowledged, and enhancement of compliance is discussed briefly.	Levy, J K	1993

7712620	Basilar artery occlusion following yoga exercise: a case report.	Basilar artery occlusion developed in a 34 year old woman 2 months after adopting unusual neck postures during yoga practice. On angiography, her basilar artery was filled with intraluminal clot while the vertebral arteries were normal. We postulate that a severe reduction in blood flow and possibly an intimal tear triggered thrombosis of the vertebral artery and that the final stroke mechanism was artery-to-artery embolism.

1484805	Mood alteration with yoga and swimming: aerobic exercise may not be necessary.	The mood benefits of Hatha yoga and swimming, two activities that differ greatly in aerobic training benefits, were examined. College students (N = 87) in two swimming classes, a yoga class, and a lecture-control class completed mood and personality inventories before and after class on three occasions. A multivariate analysis of variance indicated that both yoga participants (n = 22) and swimmers (n = 37) reported greater decreases in scores on Anget, Confusion, Tension, and Depression than did the control students (n = 28). The consistent mood benefits of yoga supported our earlier observation that the exercise need not be aerobic to be associated with mood enhancement. However, underlying and causal mechanisms remain uncertain. Among the men, the acute decreases in Tension, Fatigue, and Anger after yoga were significantly greater than those after swimming. Yoga may be even more beneficial than swimming for men who personally select to participate. The women reported fairly similar mood benefits after swimming and yoga. It seems that aerobic exercise may not be necessary to facilitate the mood benefits. Also, students with greater mood changes attended class more regularly than those who reported fewer psychological benefits. Maximizing the immediate psychological benefits of exercise might be one way to encourage adults to be physically active.	Berger, B G;Owen, D R	1992 Dec

1291472	Effect of yoga training on reaction time, respiratory endurance and muscle strength.	There is evidence that the practice of yoga improves physical and mental performance. The present investigation was undertaken to study the effect of yoga training on visual and auditory reaction times (RTs), maximum expiratory pressure (MEP), maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), 40 mmHg test, breath holding time after expiration (BHTexp), breath holding time after inspiration (BHTinsp), and hand grip strength (HGS). Twenty seven student volunteers were given yoga training for 12 weeks. There was a significant (P < 0.001) decrease in visual RT (from 270.0 +/- 6.20 (SE) to 224.81 +/- 5.76 ms) as well as auditory RT (from 194.18 +/- 6.00 to 157.33 +/- 4.85 ms). MEP increased from 92.61 +/- 9.04 to 126.46 +/- 10.75 mmHg, while MIP increased from 72.23 +/- 6.45 to 90.92 +/- 6.03 mmHg, both these changes being statistically significant (P < 0.05). 40 mmHg test and HGS increased significantly (P < 0.001) from 36.57 +/- 2.04 to 53.36 +/- 3.95 s and 13.78 +/- 0.58 to 16.67 +/- 0.49 kg respectively. BHTexp increased from 32.15 +/- 1.41 to 44.53 +/- 3.78s (P < 0.01) and BHTinsp increased from 63.69 +/- 5.38 to 89.07 +/- 9.61 s (P < 0.05). Our results show that yoga practice for 12 weeks results in significant reduction in visual and auditory RTs and significant increase in respiratory pressures, breath holding times and HGS.

1506088	Effect of Santhi Kriya on certain psychophysiological parameters: a preliminary study.	Santhi Kriya is a mixture of combined yogic practices of breathing and relaxation. Preliminary attempts were made to determine the effect of Santhi Kriya on certain psychophysiological parameters. Eight healthy male volunteers of the age group 25.9 +/- 3 (SD) years were subjected to Santhi Kriya practice daily for 50 minutes for 30 days. The volunteer's body weight, blood pressure, oral temperature, pulse rate, respiration, ECG and EEG were recorded before and after the practice on the 1st day and subsequently on 10th, 20th and 30th day of their practice. They were also given a perceptual acuity test to know their cognitive level on the 1st day and also at the end of the study i.e., on the 30th day. Results indicate a gradual and significant decrease in the body weight from 1st to 30th day (P less than 0.001) and an increase in alpha activity of the brain (P less than 0.001) during the course of 30 days of Santhi Kriya practice. Increase of alpha activity both in occipital and pre-frontal areas of both the hemispheres of the brain denotes an increase of calmness. This study also revealed that Santhi Kriya practice increases oral temperature by 3 degrees F and decreases respiratory rate significantly (P less than 0.05) on all practice days. Other parameters were not found to be altered significantly. It is concluded that the Santhi Kriya practice for 30 days reduces body weight and increases calmness.

Thirty three normal male and forty two normal female subjects, of average age of 18.5 years, underwent six weeks course in 'Pranayam' and their ventilatory lung functions were studied before and after this practice. They had improved ventilatory functions in the form of lowered respiratory rate (RR), and increases in the forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume at the end of 1st second (FEV1%), maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR-lit/sec), and prolongation of breath holding time.

1585802	Relaxation therapy reduces anxiety in child and adolescent psychiatric patients.	The immediate effects of relaxation therapy (RT) were assessed in 40 hospitalized children and adolescents with diagnoses of adjustment disorder and depression. These effects were assessed using a within subjects pre-test/post-test design and by comparison with a control group of 20 depressed and adjustment disorder patients who watched a 1-h relaxing videotape. The 1-h RT class consisted of yoga exercise, a brief massage and progressive muscle relaxation. Decreases were noted in both self-reported anxiety and in anxious behavior and fidgeting as well as increases in positive affect in the RT but not the video group. In addition, adjustment disorder patients and a third of the depressed patients showed decreases in cortisol levels following RT, while no changes were noted in the video group. Thus, both diagnostic groups appeared to benefit from the RT class.	Platania-Solazzo, A;Field, T M;Blank, J;Seligman, F;Kuhn, C;Schanberg, S;Saab, P	1992
1530282	Thermic responses to vegetarian meals and yoga exercise.	The thermic effect (TEF) of vegetarian meals was measured for breakfast and lunch in 6 lean healthy men (18-25 years) during normal feeding (NF) and with 20% overfeeding (OF) on 28 successive days. The energy contents of breakfast were 223 +/- 10 and 330 +/- 48 kcal, and those of lunch were 1,033 +/- 220 and 1,247 +/- 222 kcal in NF and OF, respectively. In NF, the TEF per 180 min was 32.7 +/- 8.6 and 54.8 +/- 6.3 kcal for breakfast and lunch, respectively. In OF, the TEF was 38.3 +/- 8.3 kcal for breakfast and 57.2 +/- 5.4 kcal for lunch. The increase in total TEF due to OF was nonsignificant (p greater than 0.2). In response to 20% OF, adaptive thermogenesis was manifested mainly through an increase in the resting metabolic rate of 4.9% (p less than 0.001). In both feeding, regimes, the percent TEF was higher for breakfast than for lunch (p less than 0.05). Regression analysis of TEF versus calorie load indicated a stable component of 42 kcal with a 2% rate of increase. Yoga exercises were performed from 16.00 to 17.00 daily. The thermic effect of yoga exercises observed from 17.10 to 18.30 was 21 kcal and persisted beyond 90 min, indicating the role of yoga in energy metabolism.	Agte, V;Chiplonkar, S	1992
1818698	Kapalabhati--yogic cleansing exercise. II. EEG topography analysis.	Topography of brain electrical activity was studied in 11 advanced yoga practitioners during yogic high-frequency breathing kapalabhati (KB). Alpha activity was increased during the initial five min of KB. Theta activity mostly in the occipital region was increased during later stages of 15 min KB compared to the pre-exercise period. Beta 1 activity increased during the first 10 min of KB in occipital and to a lesser degree in parietal regions. Alpha and beta 1 activity decreased and theta activity was maintained on the level of the initial resting period after KB. The score of General Deactivation factor from Activation Deactivation Adjective Checklist was higher after KB exercise than before the exercise. The results suggest a relative increase of slower EEG frequencies and relaxation on a subjective level as the after effect of KB exercise.

1940092	Long-term effects of exercise on psychological functioning in older men and women.	The purpose of this study was to determine the psychological, behavioral, and cognitive changes associated with up to 14 months of aerobic exercise training. For the first 4 months of the study, 101 older (greater than 60 years) men and women were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: Aerobic exercise, Yoga, or a Waiting List control group. Before and following the intervention, all subjects completed a comprehensive assessment battery, including measures of mood and cognitive functioning. A semi-crossover design was employed such that, following completion of the second assessment, all subjects completed 4 months of aerobic exercise and underwent a third assessment. Subjects were given the option of participating in 6 additional months of supervised aerobic exercise (14 months total), and all subjects, regardless of their exercise status, completed a fourth assessment. Results indicated that subjects experienced a 10-15% improvement in aerobic capacity. In general, there were relatively few improvements in cognitive performance associated with aerobic exercise, although subjects who maintained their exercise participation for 14 months experienced improvements in some psychiatric symptoms. However, the healthy subjects in this study were functioning at a relatively high level to begin with, and exercise training may produce greater improvements among elderly with concomitant physical or emotional impairments.

1787809	Melatonin supplementation from early morning auto-urine drinking.	Drinking one's morning urine ('amaroli') is a traditional practice of the yogic religion still widely performed. The pineal hormone melatonin and its conjugated esters are present in morning urine in significant quantities. Drinking the first morning urine restores plasma night-time melatonin levels due to deconjugation of its esters to melatonin. Exogenous melatonin, by either regulation of the sleep-wake cycle or enhancement of the physiological prerequisites for mediation (decreased body awareness (i.e. analgesia) and claimed slowed brain wave activity and heightened visualization ability) may be the mechanism behind the alleged benefits of 'amaroli'.

1753043	Effects of exercise training on bone density in older men and women.	OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of up to 14 months of aerobic exercise on measures of bone density in older adults. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with subjects assigned to either an aerobic exercise condition, non-aerobic yoga, or a wait list non-exercise control group for 4 months. Aerobic fitness and bone density were evaluated in all subjects at baseline (Time 1) and after 4 months (Time 2). A semi-crossover design was utilized with all subjects completing 4 months of aerobic exercise, followed by another evaluation (Time 3). All subjects were then given the option of 6 additional months of aerobic exercise, after which they had a fourth evaluation (Time 4). SETTING: An outpatient exercise rehabilitation facility at a large, major medical center. SUBJECTS: One-hundred-one healthy men (n = 50) and women (n = 51) over age 60 (Mean age = 67.0), recruited from the community. INTERVENTION: The exercise program included stretching, cycle ergometry, and walking three times per week for 60 minutes throughout the course of the study. OUTCOME MEASURES: Aerobic fitness (VO2max) as assessed by cycle ergometry, and bone density (bone mineral content) measured by single photon absorptiometry. RESULTS: Subjects achieved a 10%-15% increase in VO2max after 4 months of exercise training, and 1%-6% further improvement with additional training. Aerobic fitness was associated with significant increases in bone density in men, but not women, who maintained aerobic exercise for 14 months.

1818666	Kapalabhati--yogic cleansing exercise. I. Cardiovascular and respiratory changes.	We studied cardiovascular and respiratory changes during yogic breathing exercise kapalabhati (KB) in 17 advanced yoga practitioners. The exercise consisted in fast shallow abdominal respiratory movements at about 2 Hz frequency. Blood pressure, ECG and respiration were recorded continuously during three 5 min periods of KB and during pre- and post-KB resting periods. The beat-to-beat series of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), R-R intervals and respiration were analysed by spectral analysis of time series. The mean absolute power was calculated in three frequency bands--band of spontaneous respiration, band of 0.1 Hz rhythm and the low-frequency band greater than 15 s in all spectra. The mean modulus calculated between SBP and R-R intervals was used as a parameter of baroreceptor-cardiac reflex sensitivity (BRS). Heart rate increased by 9 beats per min during KB. SBP and DBP increased during KB by 15 and 6 mmHg respectively. All frequency bands of R-R interval variability were reduced in KB. Also the BRS parameter was reduced in KB. The amplitude of the high-frequency oscillations in SBP and DBP increased during KB. The low-frequency blood pressure oscillations were increased after KB. The results point to decreased cardiac vagal tone during KB which was due to changes in respiratory pattern and due to decreased sensitivity of arterial baroreflex. Decreased respiratory rate and increased SBP and low-frequency blood pressure oscillations after KB suggest a differentiated pattern of vegetative activation and inhibition associated with KB exercise.

1812108	Effect of yoga on aerobic and anaerobic power of muscles.	Aerobic Power (VO2 max) and anaerobic power were estimated in medical students before and after six weeks of yogic training. A significant increase in aerobic power and a significant decrease in anaerobic power was observed. This may be due to conversion of some of the Fast Twitch (F.T.) muscle fibres into Slow Twitch fibres (S.T.) during yogic training.	Balasubramanian, B;Pansare, M S	1991 Oct
1794892	Oxygen consumption during pranayamic type of very slow-rate breathing.	To determine whether the yogic Ujjayi pranayamic type of breathing that involves sensory awareness and consciously controlled, extremely slow-rate breathing including at least a period of end-inspiration breath holding in each respiratory cycle would alter oxygen consumption or not, ten males with long standing experience in pranayama, and volunteering to participate in the laboratory study were assessed. These subjects aged 28-59 yr, had normal health appropriate to their age. Since kumbhak (timed breath holding) is considered as an important phase of the respiratory cycle in the pranayama, they were categorised into two groups of five each, one group practising the short kumbhak varieties of pranayama, and the other the long kumbhak varieties of pranayama. The duration of kumbhak phase was on an average 22.2 percent of the respiratory cycle in the short kumbhak group, and 50.4 per cent in the long kumbhak group. The oxygen consumption was measured in test sessions using the closed circuit method of breathing oxygen through the Benedict-Roth spirometer. Each subject was tested in several repeat sessions. Values of oxygen consumption of the period of pranayamic breathing, and of post-pranayamic breathing period, were compared to control value of oxygen consumption of the prepranayamic breathing period of each test session. The results revealed that the short kumbhak pranayamic breathing caused a statistically significant increase (52%) in the oxygen consumption (and metabolic rate) compared to the pre-pranayamic base-line period of breathing. In contrast to the above, the long kumbhak pranayamic breathing caused a statistically significant lowering (19% of the oxygen consumption (and metabolic rate).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	Telles, S;Desiraju, T	1991 Oct

1744484	The effect of yoga on puborectalis paradox.	Nine patients with severe defaecation difficulties primarily considered to be due to puborectalis dysfunction (puborectalis paradox), verified by electromyography (EMG) of the striated anal sphincter muscles, were offered training in Yogic techniques of relaxation and muscle control in order to change the activity of the pelvic floor muscles during attempted defaecation. Five patients completed the training program of 20 2-hour sessions and were re-examined clinically and with EMG. One patient regained a normal EMG pattern but none of the patients improved clinically.	Dolk, A;Holmstrom, B;Johansson, C;Frostell, C;Nilsson, B Y	1991 Aug
1791060	A comparative study of the driving effects of dextroamphetamine and yogic meditation on muscle control for the performance of balance on balance board.	The work is aimed to compare the relative strength of dextroamphetamine and yogic meditation on the performance of 3 different groups of medical students to concentrate on the task to balance on a balance board. Group A subjects were mediators, group B subjects were given orally 5 and 10 mg of dextroamphetamine in a capsule, 1 hr prior to the test. Group C subjects were given same capsule but with lactose in place of the drug (placebo). This last groups served as control for the study. The balance index calculated taking into account their balance time and error score at each trial of 5 min duration showed that the performance of the group B (drug) had declined with overall percentile fall of 40.6% as compared to the performance of the controls (placebo) whereas, the performance of Group A (meditators) went on steadily and progressively increasing throughout the period of 10 trial days with overall percentile rise of 27.8%. The results were conclusive to confirm earlier reports that amphetamine is not of use for improvement of task rather, it deteriorates the task performance. Contrary to that, yogic meditation is of merit to achieve concentration for mental as well as physical task.	Dhume, R R;Dhume, R A	1991 Jul
11541452	Parabolic flight as a tool to measure ocular counterrotation in a reduced force environment.	Five unmedicated subjects were flown in parabolic flight. The aircraft, a Caravelle, performed single parabolae every 2 to four minutes. This resulted in alternating phases of normal, hyper-, hypo- and again hyper-gravity. Subjects sat yoga fashion upright facing towards the aircraft cockpit. Head and/or trunk were deflected 30 degrees from the upright, stimulating otolith and/or neck receptors. During each pullup, low-g phase and pullout of the parabolae a picture of the left eye was recorded on video tape. On the ground ocular roll (OCR) was determined from these video recordings. OCR ranged from 0.9 to 6.9 degrees in l-g and from 1 to 7.2 degrees under high-g, depending on head and trunk position. Neck receptor contribution was found to induce OCR of 0.2 degree to 2.1 degrees in two subjects.	Wetzig, J;Hofstetter-Degen, K;Kass, J R;Reiser, M	1991 Jun

Reflex reversal of differential air flow through nostrils (DAFTN) by the adoption of suitable lateral recumbent position was studied in male Nigerian subjects. The subjects who demonstrated more air flow through the left nostril initially in the supine position, adopted left lateral recumbent (LLR) position which brought the decongested left nostril to the down-side and the congested right nostril to the upside. Within 3 to 4 minutes after the adoption of LLR position, the air flow through the nostrils was equalised and by 11th minute the DAFTN was reversed, with more air flowing through the upsided right nostril. Return of the subjects to supine position could not result in the recovery to the initial pattern of DAFTN. It is suggested that reversal of DAFTN with adoption of suitable lateral recumbent position was a reflex effect due to the pressure stimuli to the lower lateral side of the body particularly around the shoulder region and effect was mediated through the sympathetic innervation to mucosal venous sinuses of the nostrils. Possibility of gravitational effect was ruled out.	Mohan, S M	1991 Apr

2000798	Effects of exercise training on cardiorespiratory function in men and women older than 60 years of age.	This study reports the physiologic effects of up to 14 months of aerobic exercise in 101 older (greater than 60 years) men and women. After an extensive baseline physiologic assessment (Time 1), in which aerobic capacity and blood lipids were measured, subjects were randomized to an aerobic exercise condition (cycle ergometry, 3 times per week for 1 hour), nonaerobic yoga (2 times per week for 1 hour), or a waiting list nonexercise control group for 4 months, and then underwent a second (Time 2) assessment. At the completion of the second assessment, all remaining subjects completed 4 months of aerobic exercise and were reevaluated (Time 3). Subjects were given the option of participating in 6 additional months of supervised aerobic exercise, and all available subjects completed a fourth assessment (Time 4) 14 months after their initial baseline evaluation. Results indicated that subjects generally exhibited a 10 to 15% improvement in peak oxygen consumption after 4 months of aerobic exercise training, and a 1 to 6% improvement in aerobic power with additional aerobic exercise training. On the other hand, subjects, especially men, continued to have improvements in submaximal exercise performance (i.e., anaerobic threshold). In addition, aerobic exercise was associated with an improved lipid profile; subjects participating in aerobic exercise for up to 14 months exhibited increased levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Maintenance of regular aerobic exercise for an extended time interval is associated with greater cardiovascular benefits among older adults than has been reported previously.

1918391	A note on eye movements and relaxation.	Eye movements and certain visual mechanisms appear to be related to states of relaxation and levels of wakefulness. The hatha yoga tradition in its historical and contemporary forms uses certain eye 'exercises' or postures to induce relaxation and reduce arousal. Visual correlates of the alpha state are well known. These phenomena may be involved in the success of the new eye desensitization procedure.	Hedstrom, J	1991 Mar
1751482	Observations on respiratory and cardiovascular rhythmicities during yogic high-frequency respiration.	Yogic high-frequency respiration--kapalabhati (KB)--was studied in 24 subjects from a point of rhythmicity. Respiratory movements, blood pressure and R-R intervals of ECG were recorded in parallel and evaluated by spectral analysis of time series. Respiratory signals during KB were modulated by 0.1 Hz rhythm in 82% of experiments. This component was also present in R-R intervals and blood pressure during KB. Frequency (0.2-0.3 Hz) was observed in 67% of respiratory records. The presence of the component 0.2-0.3 Hz in respiration was dependent on resting respiratory frequency. This frequency component was reduced in R-R intervals but increased in blood pressure during kapalabhati as compared to that at rest. The occurrence of both frequency components in respiration during KB supports the hypothesis about the integrative role of cardiovascular and respiratory rhythms in physiological states characterized by altered respiratory frequency.

1744029	Effect of yoga training on exercise tolerance in adolescents with childhood asthma.	Forty six young asthmatics with a history of childhood asthma were admitted for yoga training. Effects of training on resting pulmonary functions, exercise capacity, and exercise-induced bronchial lability index were measured. Yoga training resulted in a significant increase in pulmonary function and exercise capacity. A follow-up study spanning two years showed a good response with reduced symptom score and drug requirements in these subjects. It is concluded that yoga training is beneficial for young asthmatics.

1723397	Pain management and yoga.	The use of yoga and yoga related techniques in pain management is reviewed and discussed. Self-awareness, relaxation, approaches which use respiration, increased self-understanding and self-acceptance, changed context of pain, increased control, life style improvements, group and social support proved beneficial. The use of yoga in pain management has its transpersonal and philosophical dimensions. Independence and self-confidence of suffering people may be protected in this way.	Nespor, K	1991

2292976	Seasonal affective disorder and the yoga paradigm: a reconsideration of the role of the pineal gland.	Seasonal Affective Disorder is a psychiatric disorder whose pathophysiology and clinical presentation are poorly understood. By applying the ancient paradigm of yoga psychology to this subject, new understandings of the syndrome emerge regarding the possible role of the pineal gland, the clinical presentation of the syndrome, and the possible mechanism of action of phototherapy. The energy depletion model presented here ties together such diverse elements as: dose-response aspects of phototherapy, anergia as a primary symptom of SAD, 'spring fever', myofascial pain disorder, the anti-gonadotrophic effect of melatonin, and pineal supersensitivity in bipolar patients. Clinical predictions are made, and simple research protocols are suggested which can directly test the hypotheses generated by this paradigm.	Leskowitz, E	1990 Nov

2258779	Non-pharmacological treatment of hypertension.	Weight reduction, alcohol restriction, mild salt restriction, eating a vegetarian diet and increasing aerobic exercise will generally lower the blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension. Eating a diet rich in potassium and reducing caffeine intake may also be helpful in reducing the pressure, but increasing the fiber or calcium intake will generally be ineffective. Reducing fat intake from the usual 40% of total calories to 25-30% may reduce hypertension directly or by weight reduction. Smoking, when combined with excessive caffeine or alcohol intake may have an additive effect on blood pressure. Monotherapy with such behavioral techniques as self-monitoring of blood pressure, biofeedback, meditation, yoga, progressive muscular relaxation or cognitive therapy may reduce the blood pressure to a variable degree, and combinations of these treatments may be even more successful.

2246361	Intense personal experiences: subjective effects, interpretations, and after-effects.	Following leads by Maslow (1964, 1968) and others who described peak experiences, this study was designed to learn more about the (1) subjective effects; (2) after-effects; and (3) interpretations of intense positive and negative experiences. Comparisons were made between respondents' "most positive" and "most negative" experiences and between these positive experiences and those of members of a yoga ashram. It was found that except for the differences in affect, positive and negative experiences were similar in subjective effects and impact on later life. The most positive experience of most respondents fell short of peak experience as described by Maslow. On the other hand, the most positive experience of ashram respondents showed evidence of a genuine alternation of consciousness and lasting life change afterward. The results suggest that only in rare instances is therapeutic change or self-actualization initiated by peak experiences. Implications are discussed.	Wilson, S R;Spencer, R C	1990 Sep
2208228	[Occupational stress in health personnel and its prevention. Possible use of yoga].	The paper summarizes some non-specific stress factors of work in the health services (e.g. shift work) and some relatively specific stressing factors (e.g. contact with grief, intense negative emotion and death). It deals also with the consequences of excessive stress, incl. the "burnout syndrome". It gives a brief account of possible preventive measures at the individual level and at the level of the organization. In the conclusion the author mentions the possibility to use yoga in the prevention of occupational stress in the health services. Work in the health services although, associated with considerable stress, is at the same time an opportunity for personality development and self-realization.	Nespor, K	1990 Aug 3
2394387	Perceived change among participants in an exercise program for older adults.	Data regarding perceived change were collected as part of a study of the effects of aerobic exercise training on psychological, cognitive, and physiological functioning among 101 healthy older adults. Subjects were assigned randomly to an aerobic exercise group, a yoga control group, or a waiting list group for 16 weeks, after which all subjects participated in aerobic exercise for another 16 weeks. Exercise participants perceived positive changes in a wide range of significant life areas, and perceived improvement was more closely related to objective improvement for physiological indicators than for indicators of cognitive functioning or psychological well-being.

1971670	Effect of yoga breathing exercises (pranayama) on airway reactivity in subjects with asthma.	The effects of two pranayama yoga breathing exercises on airway reactivity, airway calibre, symptom scores, and medication use in patients with mild asthma were assessed in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. After baseline assessment over 1 week, 18 patients with mild asthma practised slow deep breathing for 15 min twice a day for two consecutive 2-week periods. During the active period, subjects were asked to breathe through a Pink City lung (PCL) exerciser--a device which imposes slowing of breathing and a 1:2 inspiration:expiration duration ratio equivalent to pranayama breathing methods; during the control period, subjects breathed through a matched placebo device. Mean forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), peak expiratory flow rate, symptom score, and inhaler use over the last 3 days of each treatment period were assessed in comparison with the baseline assessment period; all improved more with the PCL exerciser than with the placebo device, but the differences were not significant. There was a statistically significant increase in the dose of histamine needed to provoke a 20% reduction in FEV1 (PD20) during pranayama breathing but not with the placebo device. The usefulness of controlled ventilation exercises in the control of asthma should be further investigated.	Singh, V;Wisniewski, A;Britton, J;Tattersfield, A	1990 Jun 9
2399805	Hathayogic exercise jalandharabandha in its effect on cardiovascular response to apnoea.	Jalandharabandha (JB) is the important constituent of apnoea (kumbhaka) in hathayogic breathing exercises. It is performed by pressing the chin into the jugular notch and creating thus the positive pressure on the neck region. The influence of JB on the heart rate and vasomotor response was studied in relationship to different lung volumes. The course of R-R intervals is highly significantly different according to the type of apnoea. JB leads to the diminution of bradycardia, but does not change the position of the maximum and minimum in comparison to the apnoea without JB. Application of JB increases the number of vasodilatations and shortens the latencies of vasodilatations, duration and amplitude of reactions. JB during breath holding decreases the vagal reflex changes and may thus work as a stabilizing component in yogic breathing exercises.	Lepicovska, V;Dostalek, C;Kovarova, M	1990 Jun
2399804	Effect of Kapalabhati on blood urea, creatinine and tyrosine.	The present study conducted on twelve normal healthy male subjects showed decrease in blood urea, increase in creatinine and tyrosine after one minute of Kapalabhati, a fast-breathing technique of Hatha Yoga (120 respiratory strokes (min.). From biochemical point of view the practice of Kapalabhati seems to promote decarboxylation and oxidation mechanisms due to which quieting of respiratory centres is achieved, which is also the prerequisite for the practice of Pranayama, another important technique of Yoga.

2196946	Relaxation therapy and continuous ambulatory blood pressure in mild hypertension: a controlled study.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the long term effects of relaxation therapy on 24 hour ambulatory intra-arterial blood pressure in patients with mild untreated and uncomplicated hypertension. DESIGN: Four week screening period followed by randomisation to receive either relaxation therapy or non-specific counselling for one year. Ambulatory intra-arterial blood pressure was measured before and after treatment. SETTING: Outpatient clinic in Amsterdam's university hospital. SUBJECTS: 35 Subjects aged 20-60 who were being treated by general practitioners for hypertension but were referred to take part in the study. At three consecutive screening visits all subjects had a diastolic blood pressure without treatment of 95-110 mm Hg. Subjects were excluded if they had damaged target organs, secondary hypertension, diabetes mellitus, a cholesterol concentration greater than 8 mmol/l, or a history of malignant hypertension. INTERVENTIONS: The group allocated to relaxation therapy was trained for eight weeks (one hour a week) in muscle relaxation, yoga exercises, and stress management and continued exercising twice daily for one year with monthly visits to the clinic. The control group had the same attendance schedule but had no training and were requested just to sit and relax twice a day. All subjects were asked not to change their diet or physical activity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Changes in ambulatory intra-arterial blood pressure after one year of relaxation therapy or non-specific counselling. RESULTS: Mean urinary sodium excretion, serum concentration of cholesterol, and body weight did not change in either group. Diastolic pressures measured by sphygmomanometry were 2 and 3 mm Hg lower in subjects in the relaxation group and control group respectively at the one year follow up compared with initial readings. The mean diastolic ambulatory intra-arterial pressure during the daytime had not changed after one year in either group, but small treatment effects could not be excluded: the mean change for the relaxation group was -1 mm Hg (95% confidence interval -6 to 3.9 mm Hg) and for the control group -0.4 mm Hg (-5.3 to 4.6 mm Hg). Mean ambulatory pressure in the evening also had not changed over the year, and in both groups nighttime pressure was 5 mm Hg higher. The variability in blood pressure was the same at both measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Relaxation therapy was an ineffective method of lowering 24 hour blood pressure, being no more beneficial than non-specific advice, support, and reassurance--themselves ineffective as a treatment for hypertension.	van Montfrans, G A;Karemaker, J M;Wieling, W;Dunning, A J	1990 May 26
2370474	Simple treatment for snoring also a means of prediction of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty success?	The old Indian literature describes a technique known as Sutra-Neti. That is, passing a catheter or similar material through the nose and out of the mouth as a means of clearing the airway. One of our patients adapted this method, tying the catheter end to end, in order to control his severe snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea. This was effective for several months. He subsequently responded well to a uvulopalatopharyngoplasty.	Ramalingam, K K;Smith, M C	1990 May
