28876752		This is a summary of the results of SBU's evaluation of "Treatment of insomnia in adults". Insomnia is a general term which encompasses several types of sleep disorders. Most people who seek treatment for insomnia do so because of perceived problems such as inadequate hours of sleep or poor sleep quality, leading to a diminished sense of well-being and impaired daytime functioning. Examples of common sleep disorders are that it is hard to get to sleep, awakening after falling asleep and finding it hard to get back to sleep, awakening too early in the morning, or combinations of these disorders. Insomnia increases with age and is more common in women. Those seeking professional help for relief of insomnia usually initially receive individually tailored counselling in self-care, e.g. to try to maintain a regular diurnal rhythm, to avoid eating and drinking habits known to disturb sleep and to ensure that the environment in the bedroom is conducive to sleep. However, the present evaluation has focused on treatment methods which can be used when such self-care does not give adequate relief. SBU's Conclusions: When a decision is made to treat insomnia by pharmacotherapy it is important that the prescriber gives preference to preparations with documented effectiveness. Compared with a placebo, short-term treatment with zolpidem, zopiclone and zaleplon - substances related to bensodiazepine - result in a patient falling asleep more quickly and sleeping for longer in total. Such treatment have some risk of side effects. The risk of developing dependence is higher in individuals who already have an addiction or a mental illness. Psychological treatment methods, in the form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and other behavioural therapy results in the patient falling asleep more quickly and not being awake so long during the night. If greater reliance is to be placed on psychological treatment methods, it is a prerequisite that more therapists be trained. In the elderly patient, both insomnia in itself and medication to treat the condition can increase the risk of accidentally falling. There is however, an inadequate scientific basis on which to assess the magnitude of these risks and the interrelationship between them. There is an inadequate scientific basis on which to assess the effect of alternative and complementary methods for treatment of insomnia. The few studies available are of inadequate quality. This applies both to medication (valerian and various herbal medicines) and other methods (acupuncture, yoga, etc.).		2010 Jun
27900130	Exercise as medicine-the use of group medical visits to promote physical activity and treat chronic moderate depression: a preliminary 14-week pre-post study.	OBJECTIVE: The evidence that regular physical activity can treat depressive disorders is increasingly robust. However, motivating patients with depression to engage in physical activity can be challenging. Interdisciplinary group medical visits (GMVs) with an integrated physical activity component may be a novel means to support patients in becoming more active. METHODS: We conducted a 'pre-post' pilot study within a primary care setting. Participants were adults (>/=18 years) with a chronic major depressive disorder or a bipolar 2 disorder (depression; chronic). A psychiatrist and exercise therapist co-led a series of 14 weekly 2 h GMVs. Each group visit combined specific medical advice, physical activity, patient discussions and a targeted educational component. Participants also attended 11 weekly hatha yoga classes. Primary outcome was 'steps' as measured by accelerometer (SenseWear) as well as depression (Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9) and anxiety (Generalised Anxiety Disorder, GAD-7) ratings. RESULTS: 14 of 15 participants (93.3%) completed the 14-week programme. After 3 months postintervention, median depression scales (PHQ-9) decreased 38% from 16 to 10 (p<0.01; IQR pre/post 8/12); and median anxiety scales (GAD-7) decreased 50% from 13 to 6.5 (p<0.05; IQR 8.5/9). Median daily 'steps' increased 71% from 3366 to 5746 (IQR 2610/6237), though this was not significant (p>0.10). CONCLUSIONS: While other studies have examined the efficacy of GMVs in addressing chronic illnesses and the promotion of lifestyle changes, none to our knowledge have embedded physical activity within the actual patient visits. Interdisciplinary GMVs (eg, psychiatrist/exercise professional) may be a means to decrease depression and anxiety ratings within clinical care while improving physical activity.

26918241	Yoga intervention on blood NO in female migraineurs.	BACKGROUND: The current survey investigates the effect of 12 weeks yoga training on headache frequency, severity, duration and blood nitric oxide levels as well as headache impacts on female migraineurs' lives. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-two female patients with migraine took part and were randomly divided into two groups. The control group (n = 14) received medication and the yoga group (n = 18) participated in 12 weeks yoga training in addition to receiving the same medication as that of the control group. Frequency and duration of headache were assessed by a questionnaire. Visual Analogue Scale was used to measure the severity of headache, and the metabolite of NO also was measured by Griess reaction. Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) was also used to assess the impact of headache on patients' lives. Data were analyzed by t-test mean variance. RESULTS: After 3 months intervention, in the yoga group, there was a significant reduction in the impact of headache on patients' lives, headache frequency, and severity and a non-significant reduction in headache duration in the yoga group. There was no significant difference in the plasma levels of NO between yoga and control groups before and after the study. CONCLUSION: Based on the results, yoga could be recommended as a complementary method to migraine patients.

26885051	Functional exercise in combination with auricular plaster therapy is more conducive to rehabilitation of menopausal women patients with anxiety disorder.	OBJECTIVE: Observe the effect of functional exercise in combination with auricular plaster therapy on menopausal women patients with anxiety disorder. METHOD: Select 45 menopausal women patients with anxiety disorder and then adopt random digital table to divide them into a functional exercise group, an auricular plaster therapy group and a combination group. Each group consists of 15 patients. The patients in the functional exercise group do yoga exercise twice a day; those in the auricular plaster therapy group are provided with the auricular plaster therapy twice a day; those in the combination group do yoga exercise and then they are provided with the auricular plaster therapy twice a day. Before the treatment and after 12 weeks' treatment, respectively detect and compare the selected patients in the three groups in respect HAMA score, physical function score and mental function score; And the cured patients are followed up for 3 months to compare recurrence rate of each group. RESULTS: After 12 weeks' treatment, HAMA score, physical function score and mental function score of the combination group are obviously better than those of another two groups (P<0.05); Of the cure rate and the recurrence rate within 3 months, the cure rate of the combination group is higher and the recurrence rate is low. CONCLUSION: Through the functional rehabilitation exercise in combination with the auricular plaster, the combined curative effect is obviously better than that of single treatment and the clinical recurrence rate is significantly lower than that of single treatment. It shows that the combined treatment method presents obvious synergistic effect and the synergistic treatment is more beneficial to improve the curative effect.

26870677	Immediate effect of yogic visual concentration on cognitive performance.	The ancient Indian yoga text, Hatha Yoga Pradipika, describes six cleansing techniques. The objective of cleansing techniques is to purify and prepare the body for the practice of yoga postures, breath regulation, and meditation. Yogic visual concentration technique (trataka) is one of these techniques. A previous study showed an increase in critical flicker fusion (CFF) following yogic visual concentration (trataka). The present study planned to assess the immediate effect of trataka on cognitive performance using the Stroop color-word test. Performance on the Stroop color-word test was assessed in 30 healthy male volunteers with ages ranging from 18 years to 31 years old (22.57 +/- 3.65 years). The participants were tested before and after yogic visual concentration (trataka) and during a control session on two separate days. There was a significant improvement in performance on the Stroop color-word test after trataka compared to the control session [repeated measures analysis of variance (RM ANOVA) with Bonferroni adjustment; p < 0.001]. Performance on the Stroop color-word test was better after trataka compared to the control session suggesting that the trataka technique increased the selective attention, cognitive flexibility, and response inhibition.

26730136	A pilot study on Ayurvedic management of oral submucous fibrosis.	INTRODUCTION: Oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) is a chronic debilitating disease and a well-recognized potentially premalignant condition of the oral cavity. Various medical and surgical treatment modalities have been used in modern science, but results are not satisfactory owing to recurrence, adverse effects, and sometimes worsening the condition. On analyzing the disease condition with Ayurvedic approach, it seems to be nearer to Vata-Pitta dominant chronic Sarvasara Mukharoga and needs to be treated at local as well as systemic level. AIM: To evaluate the effect of proposed Ayurvedic treatment protocol in the patients of OSMF. MATERIALS AND METHODS: It was an open-label nonrandomized clinical trial with black box design comprising of holistic Ayurvedic approach in which 22 patients of OSMF completed the treatment. In all of them after Koshthashuddhi (mild purgation) and Shodhana Nasya (errhine therapy); Pratisarana (external application) with Madhupippalyadi Yoga, Kavala (gargling) with Ksheerabala Taila and internally Rasayana Yoga were given for 2 months and followed for 1 month. RESULTS: It revealed statistically highly significant relief in almost all signs and symptoms as well in inter incisal distance improvement. Furthermore, sustained relief was found in follow-up. CONCLUSION: Ayurvedic treatment protocol is effective in the management of OSMF.	Patel, Kundan R;Rajagopala, Manjusha;Vaghela, Dharmendrasinh B;Shah, Ashok	2015 Jan-Mar
26730131	Role of AYUSH workforce, therapeutics, and principles in health care delivery with special reference to National Rural Health Mission.	Decades back AYUSH systems of medicine were limited to their own field with few exceptions in some states as health in India is a state issue. This took a reverse turn after the initiation of National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) in 2005 which brought the concept of "Mainstreaming of AYUSH and Revitalization of Local Health Traditions" utilizing the untapped AYUSH workforces, therapeutics and principles for the management of community health problems. As on 31/03/2012 AYUSH facilities were co-located in 468 District Hospitals, 2483 Community Health Centers and 8520 Primary Health Centers in the country. Several therapeutics are currently in use and few drugs have been included in the ASHA drug kit to treat common ailments in the community. At the same time Government of India has recognized few principles and therapeutics of Ayurveda as modalities of intervention to some of the community health problems. These include Ksharasutra (medicine coated thread) therapy for ano-rectal surgeries and Rasayana Chikitsa (rejuvenative therapy) for senile degenerative disorders etc. Similarly respective principles and therapeutics can also be utilized from other systems of AYUSH such as Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy. Akin to Ayurveda these principles and therapeutics can also help in managing community health problems if appropriately implemented. This paper is a review on the role of AYUSH, as a system, in the delivery of health care in India with special reference to National Rural Health Mission.	Samal, Janmejaya	2015 Jan-Mar
26698309	Intraocular Pressure Rise in Subjects with and without Glaucoma during Four Common Yoga Positions.	PURPOSE: To measure changes in intraocular pressure (IOP) in association with yoga exercises with a head-down position. METHODS: The single Center, prospective, observational study included 10 subjects with primary open-angle glaucoma and 10 normal individuals, who performed the yoga exercises of Adho Mukha Svanasana, Uttanasana, Halasana and Viparita Karani for two minutes each. IOP was measured by pneumatonometry at baseline and during and after the exercises. RESULTS: All yoga poses were associated with a significant (P < 0.01) rise in IOP within one minute after assuming the yoga position. The highest IOP increase (P < 0.01) was measured in the Adho Mukha Svanasana position (IOP increase from 17 +/- 3.2 mmHg to 28 +/- 3.8 mmHg in glaucoma patients; from 17 +/- 2.8 mmHg to 29 +/- 3.9 mmHg in normal individuals), followed by the Uttanasana position (17 +/- 3.9 mmHg to 27 +/- 3.4 mmHg (glaucoma patients) and from 18 +/- 2.5 mmHg to 26 +/- 3.6 mmHg normal individuals)), the Halasana position (18 +/- 2.8 mmHg to 24 +/- 3.5 mmHg (glaucoma patients); 18 +/- 2.7 mmHg to 22 +/- 3.4 mmHg (normal individuals)), and finally the Viparita Kirani position (17 +/- 4 mmHg to 21 +/- 3.6 mmHg (glaucoma patients); 17 +/- 2.8 to 21 +/- 2.4 mmHg (normal individuals)). IOP dropped back to baseline values within two minutes after returning to a sitting position. Overall, IOP rise was not significantly different between glaucoma and normal subjects (P = 0.813), all though glaucoma eyes tended to have measurements 2 mm Hg higher on average. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga exercises with head-down positions were associated with a rapid rise in IOP in glaucoma and healthy eyes. IOP returned to baseline values within 2 minutes. Future studies are warranted addressing whether yoga exercise associated IOP changes are associated with similar changes in cerebrospinal fluid pressure and whether they increase the risk of glaucoma progression.

26673479	Integrating complementary/alternative medicine into primary care: evaluating the evidence and appropriate implementation.	The frequency with which patients utilize treatments encompassed by the term complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) is well documented. A number of these therapies are beginning to be integrated into contemporary medical practice. This article examines three of them: osteopathic manipulation, yoga, and acupuncture, with a focus on their physiological effects, efficacy in treating medical conditions commonly encountered by practitioners, precautions or contraindications, and ways in which they can be incorporated into clinical practice. Physicians should routinely obtain information about use of CAM as part of their patient history and should consider their role based on physiological effects and clinical research results.

26667297	Yoga Influences Recovery During Inpatient Rehabilitation: A Pilot Study.	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to add yoga therapy to inpatient rehabilitation and assess whether patients chose to engage in yoga therapy in addition to other daily therapies, to describe patients' perceptions of how yoga therapy influenced recovery, and to assess and describe patient satisfaction with the program. METHODS: This was a single-arm pilot study, adding yoga therapy to ongoing inpatient rehabilitation. Yoga therapy was offered as group yoga or individual yoga twice a week. Semi-structured interview questions were completed via telephone post-discharge. RESULTS: A total of 55 of the 77 (71%) people contacted about the study engaged in yoga therapy in the inpatient rehabilitation setting for this study and 31 (56%) of these completed the semi-structured interview questions. Qualitative data support that participants perceived that yoga therapy improved breathing, relaxation, and psychological wellbeing. Overall, participants were satisfied with the program, although they often indicated they would like increased flexibility or frequency of yoga. Almost all participants (97%) said they would recommend the yoga therapy program to others in inpatient rehabilitation. CONCLUSION: We were able to add yoga therapy to ongoing inpatient rehabilitation and participants perceived benefits of having the yoga therapy in their rehabilitation stay.

26667296	Feasibility of Establishing a Comprehensive Yoga Program and its Dose-Effect Relationship on Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Wellness Parameters: A Pilot Study.	BACKGROUND: We sought to study the feasibility of establishing a comprehensive, mostly self-directed yoga program in a hospital and its dose-effect relationship on cardiovascular risk factors and quality of life (QoL) measures over six months. METHODS: Yoga-based techniques (Advanced Yoga Practices; AYP; advancedyogapractices.com) were taught in 12 biweekly group sessions and self-directed practice at home was emphasized. Cardiovascular risk factors were elucidated by interview and review of medical history. Quality of life (QoL) outcomes included the SF-36, the Cohen Perceived Stress Scale (CPSS), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Risk factors and QoL measures were compared in participants at baseline and six months, as well as between those practicing >/= 7 times versus < 7 times per week. RESULTS: A total of 22 individuals (19 women, mean age 59 +/- 8.7 years) completed the study. At six months, changes were noted in the Mental Component Scale (MCS) of the SF-36 (p=0.0004) and the CPSS (p = 0.022). A greater improvement in CPSS was noted in those practicing >/= 7 times versus < 7 times a week (p=0.045). No changes were noted in cardiovascular risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: The prescription of a self-directed yoga program was feasible in a hospital setting and resulted in improvement in QoL measures at six months. Practicing more than seven times per week correlated with greater improvement in the perception of stress. Thus, at least a once-daily dose of AYP techniques for a significant improvement in perceived stress is an appropriate dose to employ and study in hospital settings.

26667295	An Individualized Yoga Programme for Multiple Sclerosis: A Case Study.	PURPOSE: Despite the evidence that yoga is beneficial for people with multiple sclerosis (MS), substantial in-depth qualitative studies of yoga and MS-and individualized yoga programmes (IYP), in particular-are lacking. The aims of this paper are (a) to conduct a case study on an IYP for one participant with MS in terms of her experience of yoga and how yoga affected her particular symptoms of MS, and (b) to better understand the unique and changing needs of someone with MS in the context of an IYP. DESIGN AND METHOD: Data collected for this study were sourced from a qualitative case study design with data collected via a participant diary completed over the 24-week duration of an IYP; an exit interview after the final IYP session; and weekly records completed by the yoga teacher. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. FINDINGS: Over the course of the IYP, the female participant experienced an increased awareness of negative thoughts and feelings about MS and how it affected her and her body. As the programme progressed, she began to work through these feelings and, by the end of the programme, reported experiencing improvements in muscle tone, strength, balance, psychological wellbeing, and confidence. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the importance of a programme individualized to meet the complex health and psychological needs of individuals with MS.	Powell, Lesley;Cheshire, Anna	2015
26667294	The Africa Yoga Project: A Participant-Driven Concept Map of Kenyan Teachers' Reported Experiences.	OBJECTIVE: The Africa Yoga Project (AYP) trains and funds Kenyans to teach community yoga classes. Preliminary research with a small sample of AYP teachers suggested the program had a positive impact. This study used concept mapping to explore the experiences of a larger sample. METHODS: Participants brainstormed statements about how practicing and/or teaching yoga changed them. They sorted statements into self-defined piles and rated them in terms of perceived importance. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) of sort data calculated statement coordinates wherein each statement is placed in proximity to other statements as a function of how frequently statements are sorted together by participants. These results are then and mapped in a two-dimensional space. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) of these data identified clusters (i.e., concepts) among statements. Cluster average importance ratings gave the concept map depth and indicated concept importance. Bridging analysis and researchers' conceptual understanding of yoga literature facilitated HCA interpretive decisions. RESULTS: Of 72 AYP teachers, 52 and 48 teachers participated in brainstorming and sorting/rating activities, respectively. Teachers brainstormed 93 statements about how they had changed. The resultant MDS statement map had adequate validity (stress value = .29). HCA created a 12-cluster solution with the following concepts of perceived change: Identity as a Yoga Teacher; Prosocial Development; Existential Possibility; Genuine Positive Regard; Value and Respect for Others (highest importance); Presence, Acceptance, and Competence; Service and Trust; Non-judgment and Emotion Regulation (lowest importance); Engagement and Connection; Interpersonal Effectiveness; Psychosocial Functioning; and Physical Competence and Security. CONCLUSIONS: Teachers perceived the AYP as facilitating change across physical, mental, and spiritual domains. Additional research is needed to quantify and compare this change to other health promotion program outcomes.	Klein, Jessalyn E;Cook-Cottone, Catherine;Giambrone, Carla	2015
26667293	Effect of Yoga-Based Intervention in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.	BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic illness characterized by gross inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract that can result in symptoms such as abdominal pain, cramping, diarrhea, and bloody stools. IBD is believed to be influenced by psychological factors such as stress and anxiety. Therefore, a yoga intervention that reduces stress and anxiety may be an effective complementary treatment for these disorders. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 100 IBD patients [ulcerative colitis (UC) n = 60 and Crohn's disease (CD) n = 40] during the clinical remission phase of disease were included in the study. These patients were allocated randomly to either the yoga group that underwent an 8-week yoga intervention (physical postures, pranayama, and meditation) 1- hour/day in addition to standard medical therapy (UC, n = 30; CD, n = 20) or the control group (UC, n = 30; CD n = 20), which continued with standard medical therapy alone. The main outcome measures were cardiovascular autonomic functions, serum eosinophilic cationic protein, interleukin- 2 soluble receptors, Speilberger's State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scores, and clinical symptoms. RESULTS: Before the intervention, all the outcome measures were comparable in the two groups. After the 8-week yoga intervention, fewer UC patients reported arthralgia. The number of patients reporting intestinal colic pain in the control group was higher. State and trait anxiety levels were significantly reduced in patients with UC. However, no significant changes were observed in cardiovascular autonomic functions, eosinophilic cationic proteins, or interleukin-2 soluble receptors. CONCLUSIONS: A simplified yoga-based regimen is a safe and effective complementary clinical treatment modality for patients with inflammatory bowel disease during the clinical remission phase.

26667292	Efficacy of a Satyananda Yoga Intervention for Reintegrating Adults Diagnosed with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.	The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in ex-combatants from illegal armed groups in Colombia has been estimated at 37.4%. This high prevalence indicates a need to explore alternative and adjunctive therapies in the treatment of PTSD. A randomized controlled trial was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a protocol based on Satyananda Yoga(R) in PTSD-diagnosed reintegrating adults in Colombia. One hundred reintegrating adults (n = 50 for each of the yoga and control arms) from Bogota and Medellin participated in this study. Yoga participants engaged in a Satyananda Yoga intervention for 16 weeks while the control group continued the regular demobilization program. The Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist - Civilian Version (PCL-C) was used to evaluate the effects of the applied therapy. Outcomes were assessed before entry and after the treatment. T-tests revealed a treatment effect of d = 1.15 for the yoga group and a between-groups effect size of d = .73. The difference in improvement in PCL-C scores between both groups was 18.91% (p < 0.05). The highest percentage of improvement was observed in the re-experiencing symptom cluster (23.71%; p < 0.05), with a treatment effect of d = 1.40 for the yoga group and a between-groups effect size of d = 1.15. The data suggest that Satyananda Yoga methodology is an effective therapy for reintegrating adults diagnosed with PTSD. Further research is needed in order to evaluate prolonged effects of this alternative therapy.	Quinones, Natalia;Maquet, Yvonne Gomez;Velez, Diana Maria Agudelo;Lopez, Maria Adelaida	2015
26667291	The Effects of Mindfulness-Based Movement on Parameters of Stress.	The Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program (MBSR) of Kabat-Zinn includes a combination of sitting meditation, yoga, and walking; thus, movement is not emphasized primarily to induce a state of awareness. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a Mindfulness-Based Movement Program (MBM) in women on parameters of stress and coping; that is, in contrast to MBSR, MBM primarily emphasized yoga to cultivate awareness. This study investigated: (a) an objective measure of stress (the cortisol response to a laboratory stressor) following an 8-week MBM in year 1 participants only (n = 17; MBM group = 9; Control group = 8); (b) subjective measures of stress following an 8-week MBM in years 1 and 2 (n = 32; MBM = 16; C = 16); and (c) changes in coping style following an 8- week MBM in years 1 and 2 (n = 32; MBM = 16; C = 16). A mixed plot 2 (Group: TC or MBM) by 5 (Trial: Baseline, Stressor, Recovery 1, Recovery 2, and Recovery 3) repeated measures ANOVA was run for cortisol. Preliminary results indicated a strong trend towards a lowered cortisol response for the MBM group compared to the control group. A mixed plot 2 (Group: TC or MBM) by 2 (Time: Pretest, Post-test) repeated measures ANOVA was run for Spielberg's State Anxiety, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Problem Focused Style of Coping Scale for the Suppressive, Reflective, and the Reactive Coping Style. There were significant main effects for time, group, and an interaction of time and group for Spielberg's State Anxiety and the Perceived Stress Scale. Significant differences were also found for time and the interaction of time and group for the Problem Focused Style of Coping for the Reflective Coping Style (p < 0.05). In conclusion, results indicate positive effects of the MBM program on perceived measures of stress and coping style in women.

26667290	A Yoga Stress Reduction Intervention for University Faculty, Staff, and Graduate Students.	Yoga can be an effective intervention for physical and psychological symptoms and decreased ability to cope with physical, emotional, vocational, or academic stress. One group of individuals challenged regarding adequate self-care in the face of stress are personnel in university training programs for helping professions (e.g., psychology, nursing, nutrition). This feasibility study explored engagement in and effectiveness of a systematic 10-week yoga program aimed at university faculty, staff, and students. The intervention consisted of 10 weekly 90-minute sessions that were structured to include conceptual grounding, breathing, postures, and meditation. Weekly class outlines were made available to students for home practice. Participants signed informed consents, liability waivers, and health screenings. Self-reports of home practice, barriers to practice, perceived stress, and stress symptoms were used to evaluate whether the intervention was successful in engaging participants and reducing stress-related symptoms. Engagement was demonstrated by study adherence in the first 10-week series (88%; 44 of 50 enrolled), as well as re-enrollment for at least one additional 10-week series (64%; 28 of 44). Intervention success was demonstrated through repeated measure s ANOVAs of 44 participants' data, which showed significant improvement after a single 10-week series in perceived stress, as well as self-reported psychological, behavioral, and physical symptoms of stress. The study demonstrates feasibility of a yoga intervention in an academic setting and provides preliminary evidence for efficacy in stress reduction. It also supplies 10 detailed session protocols for intervention replication.	Brems, Christiane	2015
26667289	The Essential Properties of Yoga Questionnaire: Development and Methods.	Yoga interventions have considerable heterogeneity, are multi-dimensional, and may impact health in different ways. However, most research reports regarding the effects of yoga on health and wellbeing do not adequately describe the components of the yoga interventions being used. Thus, drawing comparisons across studies or understanding the relative effects of specific aspects of a yoga intervention are rarely possible. To address this problem, we created the Essential Properties of Yoga Questionnaire (EPYQ) Project, an NCCAM-funded set of studies to develop a translational tool for yoga researchers. Here we describe the methods and developmental processes used in the EPYQ Project in detail. The project consists of four main phases. Phase I was designed to gain a comprehensive understanding of the relevant aspects of yoga by conducting a comprehensive systematic literature review and conducting focus groups with stakeholders including a wide variety of yoga teachers and students. In Phase II, a pool of potential questionnaire items was developed for the prototypic questionnaire using information from Phase I. Cognitive interviews were conducted with the preliminary EPYQ items to assess the perceived clarity, meaning, and importance of each item. In Phase III, the prototypic questionnaire was administered to two large samples of yoga students and instructors. Military personnel and veterans who practiced or taught yoga (n = 329) were recruited to participate. Factor analysis and item response theory were used to identify factors and select the final questionnaire items. Phase IV is ongoing and will collect reliability and validity data on the final instrument. Results are expected to be available in 2016. The EPYQ will provide an objective tool for describing the amount of various components of yoga interventions, eventually allowing researchers to link specific yoga components to health benefits, and facilitating the design of yoga interventions for specific health conditions.

26667288	Incorporating Yoga Therapy into Primary Care: The Casey Health Institute.	Individuals seek complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for a variety of health conditions, and yoga is a popular CAM modality. Over the past few decades, yoga has become incorporated into hundreds of healthcare facilities, most commonly in large university medical centers. While research has shown yoga to be effective in reducing symptoms and improving outcomes in chronic health conditions, most patients seek yoga therapy on their own, as few primary care practitioners have incorporated yoga therapy into their practices. The purpose of this article is to describe the efforts of the Casey Health Institute to incorporate yoga therapy into their primary care integrative medicine center. At Casey Health, a full-time Clinical Yoga Specialist works alongside the physicians, nurses, and CAM providers in delivering care to a wide variety of patients. The majority of referrals to yoga therapy have been for pain-related musculoskeletal conditions, as well as hypertension, headaches, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances. Most patients attend weekly 60-minute individual sessions, and the Clinical Yoga Specialist stays in touch with the patient between appointments via telephone and email. T h e Clinical Yoga Specialist has become an integral part of Casey Health, participating in collaborative medical appointments in which two CAM practitioners provide simultaneous treatments to a patient. She also participates in the clinic's ongoing weight loss program. The Clinical Yoga Specialist spends one morning each week "floating" in the clinic, when she is on-call to the practitioners to assist in treatment and/or to introduce a yoga therapy experience to the patients. These brief interventions introduce the patients to the therapeutic benefits of yoga, while simultaneously demonstrating yoga's effectiveness to the healthcare providers. Casey Health has developed a unique teacher training program whose faculty includes senior Iyengar yoga teachers as well as physicians and CAM practitioners. Casey Health is incorporating clinical outcomes into their electronic medical record that can be used internally to assess comparable effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the different treatment modalities such as yoga therapy, providing evidence that eventually may lead to yoga therapy becoming an accepted treatment that is eligible for insurance reimbursement.

26667286	Yoga Research and Spirituality: A Case Study Discussion.	There is growing evidence that yoga can be beneficial as an aspect of self-care for people with arthritis. However, yoga may be less acceptable to those from different cultures, socioeconomic backgrounds, and racial/ethnic identities. While implementing a feasibility/acceptability pilot study of yoga as self-care in minority communities, the subject of spirituality surfaced. This commentary shares the experience of the researchers and yoga teachers collaborating on the study and the larger conversation that ensued following the withdrawal of one of the study participants. It is an attempt to start a relevant and needed dialogue around yoga research as an integrative health modality, and why the underlying body-mind-spirit approach to yoga may sometimes serve as a barrier to participation for diverse populations suffering from arthritis.

26667285	Why Ayurvedic Yoga Therapists and Why Now?	IAYT has paved the way for yoga therapy as a healing profession to grow and develop its mission to deliver optimal therapeutics via individual sessions and tailored group classes. For the past five years, the National Ayurvedic Medical Association (NAMA) has been working behind the scenes to consider the value and definition of an ayurvedic yoga therapist (AYT) professional designation within the yoga therapy discipline. The AYT designation would complement the current standards for yoga therapists that have been published by IAYT. The purpose of this paper is to discuss (1) why the AYT designation is important; (2) how it supports and expands on IAYT's mission; and (3) why now is the appropriate time to develop competencies, standards, and a scope of practice for ayurvedic yoga therapy.

26667284	Yoga Therapy: Building a Holding Environment for Somatic and Psyche Change.	Drawing on ideas from D.W. Winnicott and the work of Quaker theologian Parker Palmer, this article discusses the concept of a holding environment, its refined understanding in the literature over the years, and how it can be optimally used in yoga therapy. The evidence shows that effectively establishing a holding environment can facilitate both somatic and deep structural change in a client, facilitating healing from primal wounding as well as the potential reconnection to the true self.

26667283	Yoga Therapy Research: A Whole-Systems Perspective on Comparative Effectiveness and Patient-Centered Outcomes.	For the yoga research community to capitalize on its current momentum, it is critical to consider certain developments in research theory and innovative methodologies. The concept of model validity must be incorporated in yoga therapy research so that explanatory constructs employed and outcome measures chosen reflect the principles of traditional yogic science. Focusing on effectiveness research will ensure maximum generalizability of study results and reflect real-world therapy delivery settings, thereby increasing the relevance of outcomes. Whole systems of healing require research methodologies that address complex relationships between multi-target therapies with multiple potential treatment results. Complex, dynamic systems theory provides the theoretical and methodological innovations necessary to design studies, choose outcomes, and analyze data in a way that can account for charting complex, cyclical, therapeutic trajectories across time. Emphasizing patient-centered outcomes is aligned with the patent-oriented and tailored natured of yoga therapy delivery. Increasing the quality and quantity of comparative effectiveness research to analyze the harms and benefits of contrasting therapies can provide an infrastructure for designing studies that can have significant practical impact. The creation of practice-based research networks within the yoga research community will incentivize links between mainstream clinical researchers and yoga therapy delivery settings, ultimately developing collaborative networks. Yoga therapy centers can facilitate patient recruitment for studies and inform standards for yoga researchers. Collaborative efforts between the yoga and ayurvedic research communities will streamline efforts, solidify expertise, cross-pollinate theoretical and methodological innovation, and consolidate efforts to secure research funding and increase publication and dissemination of study findings.

26629905	Associated Factors and Consequences of Risk of Bias in Randomized Controlled Trials of Yoga: A Systematic Review.	BACKGROUND: Bias in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of complementary therapy interventions seems to be associated with specific factors and to potentially distort the studies' conclusions. This systematic review assessed associated factors of risk of bias and consequences for the studies' conclusions in RCTs of yoga as one of the most commonly used complementary therapies. METHODS: Medline/PubMed, Scopus, IndMED and the Cochrane Library were searched through February 2014 for yoga RCTs. Risk of selection bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool and regressed to a) publication year; b) country of origin; c) journal type; and d) impact factor using multiple logistic regression analysis. Likewise, the authors' conclusions were regressed to risk of bias. RESULTS: A total of 312 RCTs were included. Impact factor ranged from 0.0 to 39.2 (median = 1.3); 60 RCT (19.2%) had a low risk of selection bias, and 252 (80.8%) had a high or unclear risk of selection bias. Only publication year and impact factor significantly predicted low risk of bias; RCTs published after 2001 (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 12.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.7, 94.0; p<0.001) and those published in journals with impact factor (adjusted OR = 2.6; 95%CI = 1.4, 4.9; p = 0.004) were more likely to have low risk of bias. The authors' conclusions were not associated with risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: Risk of selection bias was generally high in RCTs of yoga; although the situation has improved since the publication of the revised CONSORT statement 2001. Pre-CONSORT RCTs and those published in journals without impact factor should be handled with increased care; although risk of bias is unlikely to distort the RCTs' conclusions.

26592214	Yoga therapy in an individual with spinal cord injury: A case report.	No known research addresses the effects of yoga in those with spinal cord injury (SCI), yet yoga has the potential to improve many impairments commonly associated with SCI. This case report documents the outcomes of a yoga program in an individual with an SCI. The participant was a 59-year-old male who sustained an incomplete C3-C6 SCI. He practiced Hatha yoga for 60-min sessions, twice per week for 12 weeks and despite neurological injury, was able to complete a yoga program with modifications. Improvements were noted in balance; endurance; flexibility; posture; muscle strength of the hip extensors, hip abductors and knee extensors; and in performance of functional goals. No changes were noted in gait velocity, satisfaction in performance of goals or in overall quality of life. The participant was able to practice yoga even though he used an assistive device to walk.

26587075	A Systematic Review of the Effects of Exercise Interventions on Body Composition in HIV+ Adults.	Over the years, physical activity and exercise have been used to positively impact the health and quality of life of persons infected with HIV and, more recently, has been associated with a spectrum of body composition changes. The aim of this review was to examine the effects of various exercise interventions on body composition in HIV positive adults, using a search strategy of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs). A systematic review was performed by five independent reviewers using a predetermined protocol adapted from previous research for assessing the articles for inclusion, the extracted data, and methodological quality. Eight RCTs involving 430 (26% female) HIV positive adults performing exercise a minimum of thrice weekly for at least six weeks were finally selected: Four were progressive resistance training (PRT) studies, three were aerobic training (AT) studies, and one involved yoga. In the PRT studies, there were significant increases in three anthropometric measures, namely, body mass, sum of skinfolds and sum of limb girths. In the AT studies, significant decreases were found in seven anthropometric measures, namely, body mass index, waist-hip ratio, body mass, triceps skinfold, waist circumference and sum of skinfolds. With yoga, the changes were non-significant. Exercise contributes to improved body composition and, when applied safely, appears to be beneficial for adults living with HIV/AIDS. However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the relatively few RCTs published to date. Future studies would benefit from increased attention to sample size, female participants, participant follow-up, complete statistical analysis and intention-to-treat analysis.

26565982	[Yoga in Germany - Results of a Nationally Representative Survey].	BACKGROUND: Yoga is increasingly used as a therapeutic and preventive method worldwide. The aim of this nationally representative survey was to assess prevalence and patterns of yoga practice in Germany. METHODS: Between August and September 2014, a nationally representative sample of 2,041 individuals of at least 14 years of age was interviewed regarding actual and prior yoga practice. Differences between socioeconomic subgroups were analyzed using chi-squared tests. RESULTS: Lifetime prevalence of yoga practice was 15.1%, point prevalence 3.3%. Higher prevalence was associated with female gender (p < 0.001), higher education (p < 0.001), employment (p = 0.047), and living in a major city (p < 0.001). Mean duration of yoga practice was 48.2 months; 61.7% practiced at least once weekly. The main reasons for yoga practice were improved physical (62.8%) and mental well-being (56.9%) as well as physical (54.4%) and mental capacity (50.0%). Positive changes due to yoga were reported by 89.7% of practitioners, mainly increased inner balance (58.8%). Another 16.1% of those who were not currently practicing could imagine practicing yoga in the next 12 months. CONCLUSION: An estimated 15.7 million Germans are currently practicing yoga or are at least interested in starting to practice, most commonly women, metropolitans, and those with a higher education as well as employed persons. Almost 90% practitioners report positive changes due to their yoga practice.	Cramer, Holger	2015
26543789	Exercise-based interventions for cancer survivors in India: a systematic review.	Existing literature suggests that cancer survivors present with high rates of morbidity due to various treatment and disease induced factors. Research globally has shown exercise to be beneficial in improving treatment outcomes and quality of life. India has a high prevalence of cancer and not much is known about exercise interventions for cancer survivors in India. This review was planned to review the state of exercise based interventions for cancer survivors in India. A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, PEDro, IndMed, and Shoda Ganga. The search results were screened and data extracted by two independent reviewers. All eligible studies were assessed for methodological quality rating using Downs and Black checklist. Data was extracted using a pilot tested pro forma to summarize information on site and stage of cancer, type of exercise intervention and outcome measures. The review identified 13 studies, published from 1991 to 2013, after screening 4060 articles. Exercise interventions fell into one of three categories: (1) yoga-based, (2) physiotherapy-based and (3) speech therapy based interventions; and exclusively involved either breast or head and neck cancers. Studies were generally of low to moderate quality. A broad range of outcomes were found including symptoms, speech and swallowing, and quality of life and largely supported the benefits of exercise-based interventions. At present, research involving exercise-based rehabilitation interventions in India is limited in volume, quality and scope. With the growing burden of cancer in the country, there is an immediate need for research on exercise based interventions for cancer survivors within the sociocultural context of India.

26535289	Long-term Outcomes After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction in Patients 60 Years and Older.	BACKGROUND: Studies evaluating the benefit of surgical reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in middle-aged patients have shown promising results, but study populations were limited primarily to patients who were 40 to 60 years old. Some authors have suggested that surgery may benefit these older patients. HYPOTHESIS: Patients aged >/=60 years with functional instability after ACL injury would benefit from ACL reconstruction. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Medical records from 1984 through 2010 were searched for patients aged >/=60 years who had undergone primary arthroscopic ACL reconstruction at a single institution. Fifteen patients (15 knees) were identified as meeting the above criteria. All patients were contacted for a telephone interview, and they completed Short Form-36 and modified Cincinnati Knee Score forms. One patient was deceased, and 1 had undergone revision to total knee arthroplasty. Among the remaining 13 patients, the mean age at surgery was 63.5 years (range, 60-73 years), and the mean patient age at the time of follow-up was 73 years (range, 65-85 years). Preoperative radiographs showed no obvious evidence of arthritis in 10 (77%) of the 13 patients; small osteophytes without loss of joint space were seen in 3 (23%) patients. The mean length of follow up was 115.7 months (range, 53-193 months). RESULTS: At their last clinic visits, all 13 patients had regained full range of motion and returned to sports or exercise, such as tennis, golf, gym exercise, and yoga. Twelve patients reported no joint laxity. CONCLUSION: Patients aged >/=60 years with symptomatic instability from ACL injury can have good to excellent subjective outcomes with surgical reconstruction. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Physicians who treat active patients older than 60 years should not exclude ACL reconstruction based on the patient's age alone.

26517583	MsFLASH participants' priorities for alleviating menopausal symptoms.	OBJECTIVE: To describe self-reported menopausal symptom priorities and their association with demographics and other symptoms among participants in an intervention trial for vasomotor symptoms (VMS). METHODS: Cross-sectional study embedded in the MsFLASH 02 trial, a three-by-two factorial design of yoga vs. exercise vs. usual activity and omega-3-fatty acid vs. placebo. At baseline, women (n = 354) completed hot flush diaries, a card sort task to prioritize symptoms they would most like to alleviate, and standardized questionnaires. RESULTS: The most common symptom priorities were: VMS (n = 322), sleep (n = 191), concentration (n = 140), and fatigue (n = 116). In multivariate models, women who chose VMS as their top priority symptom (n = 210) reported significantly greater VMS severity (p = 0.004) and never smoking (p = 0.012), and women who chose sleep as their top priority symptom (n = 100) were more educated (p </= 0.001) and had worse sleep quality (p < 0.001). ROC curves identified sleep scale scores that were highly predictive of ranking sleep as a top priority symptom. CONCLUSIONS: Among women entering an intervention trial for VMS and with relatively low prevalence of depression and anxiety, VMS was the priority symptom for treatment. A card sort may be a valid tool for quickly assessing symptom priorities in clinical practice and research.

26514476	Tobacco Use Increases Oxidative DNA Damage in Sperm - Possible Etiology of Childhood Cancer.	BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking and tobacco chewing are common modes of consuming tobacco all over the world. Parents need to be aware that germ cell integrity is vital for birth of healthy offspring as biological parenting begins much before birth of a child and even before conception. The present study was conducted to determine the etiology of non-familial sporadic heritable retinoblastoma (NFSHRb), by evaluating oxidative sperm DNA damage in fathers due to use of tobacco (smoking and chewing). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited 145 fathers of NFSHRb children and 53 fathers of healthy children (controls) in the study. Tobacco history was obtained by personal interview. Seminal reactive oxygen species (ROS) in semen, sperm DNA fragmentation index (DFI) and 8 hydroxy 2' deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels in sperm were evaluated. The RB1 gene was screened in genomic blood DNA of parents of children with NFSHRb and controls. Odds ratios (ORs) derived from conditional logistic regression models. RESULTS: There was significant difference in the levels of ROS (p<0.05), DFI (p<0.05) and 8-OHdG (p<0.05) between tobacco users and non-users. The OR of NFSHRb for smokers was 7.29 (95%CI 2.9-34.5, p<0.01), for tobacco chewers 4.75 (2.07-10.9, p<0.05) and for both 9.11 (3.79-39.2; p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This study emphasizes the adverse effect of tobacco on the paternal genome and how accumulation of oxidative damage in sperm DNA may contribute to the etiology of NFSHRb. In an ongoing parallel study in our laboratory, 11 of fathers who smoked underwent. Meditation and yoga interventions, showed significant decline in levels of highly mutagenic oxidised DNA adducts after 6 months. Thus our lifestyle and social habits impact sperm DNA integrity and simple interventions like yoga and meditation are therapeutic for oxidative damage to sperm DNA.

26509083	Ketamine, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, and Depression Specific Yoga and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy in Management of Treatment Resistant Depression: Review and Some Data on Efficacy.	Depression affects about 121 million people worldwide and prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) in US adults is 6.4%. Treatment resistant depression (TRD) accounts for approximately 12-20% of all depression patients and costs $29-$48 billion annually. Ketamine and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) have useful roles in TRD, but their utility in long term is unknown. As per the latest literature, the interventions using Yoga and meditation including the mindfulness based cognitive therapy (MBCT) have been useful in treatment of depression and relapse prevention. We present a review of rTMS, ketamine, and MBCT and also report efficacy of a depression specific, innovative, and translational model of Yoga and mindfulness based cognitive therapy (DepS Y-MBCT), developed by the first author. DepS Y-MBCT as an adjunctive treatment successfully ameliorated TRD symptoms in 27/32 patients in an open label pilot trial in TRD patients. Considering the limitations of existing treatment options, including those of ketamine and rTMS when used as the sole modality of treatment, we suggest a "tiered approach for TRD" by combining ketamine and rTMS (alone or along with antidepressants) for rapid remission of acute depression symptoms and to use DepS Y-MBCT for maintaining remission and preventing relapse.

26504475	The Effects of Bikram Yoga on Health: Critical Review and Clinical Trial Recommendations.	Bikram yoga is a style of hatha yoga involving a standarized series of asanas performed to an instructional dialogue in a heated environment (40.6 degrees C, 40% humidity). Several studies evaluating the effect of Bikram yoga on health-related outcomes have been published over the past decade. However, to date, there are no comprehensive reviews of this research and there remains a lack of large-scale, robustly-designed randomised controlled trials (RCT) of Bikram yoga training. The purpose of this review is to contextualise and summarise trials that have evaluated the effects of Bikram yoga on health and to provide recommendations for future research. According to published literature, Bikram yoga has been shown to improve lower body strength, lower and upper body range of motion, and balance in healthy adults. Non-RCTs report that Bikram yoga may, in some populations, improve glucose tolerance, bone mineral density, blood lipid profile, arterial stiffness, mindfulness, and perceived stress. There is vast potential for further, improved research into the effects of Bikram yoga, particularly in unhealthy populations, to better understand intervention-related adaptations and their influence on the progression of chronic disease. Future research should adhere to CONSORT guidelines for better design and reporting to improve research quality in this field.	Hewett, Zoe L;Cheema, Birinder S;Pumpa, Kate L;Smith, Caroline A	2015
26491461	Are There Benefits from Teaching Yoga at Schools? A Systematic Review of Randomized Control Trials of Yoga-Based Interventions.	Introduction. Yoga is a holistic system of varied mind-body practices that can be used to improve mental and physical health and it has been utilized in a variety of contexts and situations. Educators and schools are looking to include yoga as a cost-effective, evidence-based component of urgently needed wellness programs for their students. Objectives. The primary goal of this study was to systematically examine the available literature for yoga interventions exclusively in school settings, exploring the evidence of yoga-based interventions on academic, cognitive, and psychosocial benefits. Methods. An extensive search was conducted for studies published between 1980 and October 31, 2014 (PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase, ISI, and the Cochrane Library). Effect size analysis, through standardized mean difference and Hedges'g, allowed for the comparison between experimental conditions. Results and Conclusions. Nine randomized control trials met criteria for inclusion in this review. Effect size was found for mood indicators, tension and anxiety in the POMS scale, self-esteem, and memory when the yoga groups were compared to control. Future research requires greater standardization and suitability of yoga interventions for children.	Ferreira-Vorkapic, C;Feitoza, J M;Marchioro, M;Simoes, J;Kozasa, E;Telles, S	2015
26491457	Perceptions of Yoga Therapy Embedded in Two Inpatient Rehabilitation Hospitals: Agency Perspectives.	Inpatient medical rehabilitation has maintained a typical medical-model focus and structure for many years. However, as integrative therapies, such as yoga therapy, emerge as treatments which can enhance the physical and mental health of its participants, it is important to determine if they can be easily implemented into the traditional rehabilitation structure and milieu. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the perceptions of key agency personnel on the feasibility and utility of yoga therapy implemented in inpatient rehabilitation. This study reports the results of focus groups and an individual interview with key stakeholders (administrators and rehabilitation therapists) from two rehabilitation hospitals following the implementation of yoga therapy. Results focused on several key themes: feasibility from the therapist and administrator perspectives, challenges to implementation, and utility and benefit. Overall, the implementation and integration of yoga therapy were positive; however, some programmatic and policy and organizational considerations remain. Implications for practice and future research are provided.	Van Puymbroeck, Marieke;Miller, Kristine K;Dickes, Lori A;Schmid, Arlene A	2015
26485401	Treating Depressive Symptoms in Psychosis: A Network Meta-Analysis on the Effects of Non-Verbal Therapies.	AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine whether non-verbal therapies are effective in treating depressive symptoms in psychotic disorders. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Psychinfo, Picarta, Embase and ISI Web of Science, up to January 2015. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a non-verbal intervention to a control condition in patients with psychotic disorders, whilst measuring depressive symptoms as a primary or secondary outcome, were included. The quality of studies was assessed using the 'Clinical Trials Assessment Measure for psychological treatments' (CTAM) scale. Cohen's d was calculated as a measure of effect size. Using a Network Meta-analysis, both direct and indirect evidence was investigated. RESULTS: 10 RCTs were included, of which three were of high quality according to the CTAM. The direct evidence demonstrated a significant effect on the reduction in depressive symptoms relative to treatment as usual (TAU), in favor of overall non-verbal therapy (ES: -0.66, 95% C.I. = -0.88, -0.44) and music therapy (ES: -0.59, 95% C.I. = -0.85, -0.33). Combining both direct and indirect evidence, yoga therapy (ES: -0.79, 95% C.I. = -1.24, -0.35) had a significant effect on depressive symptoms, and occupational therapy (ES: 1.81, 95% C.I. = 0.81, 2.81) was less effective, relative to TAU. Exercise therapy did not show a significant effect on depressive symptoms in comparison to TAU (ES: -0.02 95% C.I. = -0.67, 0.62). Due to inconsistency of study evidence, the indirect effects should be interpreted cautiously. CONCLUSIONS: Non-verbal therapies appear to be effective in reducing depressive symptomatology in psychotic disorders, in particular music therapy and yoga therapy.

26484519	Efficacy of exercise intervention programs on cognition in people suffering from multiple sclerosis, stroke and Parkinson's disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of current evidence.	BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is a well-established sequela of people suffering from neurological pathologies. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of exercise intervention programs on cognitive performance in participants suffering from stroke, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. METHODS: Four online databases (CINAHL, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PEDro) were comprehensively searched from their inception through December 2014. The search query was phrased as follows: In people suffering from MS, stroke or Parkinson's disease, do exercise intervention programs improve cognitive performance? RESULTS: Twelve controlled clinical trials met our inclusion criteria. Studies were classified according to three clinical subgroups: Parkinson's disease (n = 3), stroke (n = 1) and multiple sclerosis (n = 8). Eight studies employed an aerobic intervention program; one used an active exercise program based on virtual reality systems, three reports examined the effect of yoga and one compared the intervention program with sport climbing. Significant improvements in cognition were found in nine out of the twelve studies. Nevertheless, the total effect size was non-significant (0.18 (95% CI, - 4.1, 3.8)) for changes in executive functions. CONCLUSION: Due to lack of commonality between measures of cognition, training sequences and intervention period, it remains unclear as to whether exercise training can be effective in improving the cognitive functions of neurological patients.

26478825	Yoga in public school improves adolescent mood and affect.	The purpose of the present study was to directly compare the acute effects of participating in a single yoga class versus a single standard physical education (PE) class on student mood. Forty-seven high school students completed self-report questionnaires assessing mood and affect immediately before and after participating in a single yoga class and a single PE class one week later. Data were analyzed using paired-samples t tests and Wilcoxon-signed ranks tests and by comparing effect sizes between the two conditions. Participants reported significantly greater decreases in anger, depression, and fatigue from before to after participating in yoga compared to PE. Significant reductions in negative affect occurred after yoga but not after PE; however, the changes were not significantly different between conditions. In addition, after participating in both yoga and PE, participants reported significant decreases in confusion and tension, with no significant difference between groups. Results suggest that school-based yoga may provide unique benefits for students above and beyond participation in PE. Future research should continue to elucidate the distinct psychological and physiological effects of participating in yoga compared to PE activities.

26401924	A Role for Complementary and Integrative Medicine in Alzheimer's Disease Prevention.	Complementary and Integrative Medicine has been maturing as a field to support treatment for a variety of medical conditions. The approaches, including yoga, meditation, acupuncture, and dietary supplements, may assist patients in a variety of ways, though clear explanations for their mechanisms of action or measurements of their possible benefit are in most cases elusive. In this issue of the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, Khalsa examines the use of meditation as a stress-reduction technique and provides an argument that with a specific technique such stress reduction can be provided efficiently, with relatively little interference in daily activities, and might decrease Alzheimer risk. This thorough review provides some evidence of physiological benefit of meditation to brain function. While any actual effect of meditation on Alzheimer pathophysiology is only conjectural, meditation has received considerable attention as a tool that may have positive psychological and medical benefits. Consequently, this review is welcome. What is less certain is whether the recommended meditation approach is of specific benefit for Alzheimer's disease or any other condition above and beyond what might be provided by many other types of exercises (like singing in a chorus or doing cross-word puzzles) or physical activities (like swimming or yoga).

26401400	Single session of integrated "silver yoga" program improves cardiovascular parameters in senior citizens.	AIM AND OBJECTIVE: This pilot study was carried out to determine cardiovascular effects of a single session of an integrated "silver yoga" program in senior citizens of Serene Pelican Township, Pondicherry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) measurements were recorded in 124 senior citizens (75 female, 49 male) with mean age of 67.19 +/- 10.61 year who attended an integrated "Silver Yoga" program at Centre for Yoga Therapy, Education and Research from August to October 2014. Participants practiced the protocol that was specially designed for senior citizens, keeping in mind their health status and physical limitations. This included simple warm-ups (jathis), breath body movement coordination practices (kriyas), static stretching postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayamas), relaxation and simple chanting. Non-invasive BP apparatus was used to record the HR, systolic (SP) and diastolic pressure (DP) before and after the 60 min sessions. Pulse pressure (PP), mean pressure (MP), rate-pressure product (RPP) and double product (DoP) indices were derived from the recorded parameters. Student's paired t-test was used to compare data that passed normality testing by Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test and Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test for those that did not. P < 0.05 were accepted as indicating significant differences for pre-post comparisons. RESULTS: All parameters witnessed a reduction following the single session. This was statistically more significant (P < 0. 0001) in HR, RPP and DoP while it was also significant (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05) in SP and PP, respectively. The decrease in MP just missed significance (P = 0.054) while it was not significant in DP. CONCLUSION: There is a healthy reduction in HR, BP and derived cardiovascular indices following a single yoga session in geriatric subjects. These changes may be attributed to enhanced harmony of cardiac autonomic function as a result of coordinated breath-body work and mind-body relaxation due to an integrated "Silver Yoga" program.

26395825	Effect of a six-month yoga exercise intervention on fitness outcomes for breast cancer survivors.	Yoga-based exercise has proven to be beneficial for practitioners, including cancer survivors. This study reports on the improvements in physical fitness for 20 breast cancer survivors who participated in a six-month yoga-based exercise program (YE). Results are compared to a comprehensive exercise (CE) program group and a comparison (C) exercise group who chose their own exercises. "Pre" and "post" fitness assessments included measures of anthropometrics, cardiorespiratory capacity, strength and flexibility. Descriptive statistics, effect size (d), dependent sample 't' tests for all outcome measures were calculated for the YE group. Significant improvements included: decreased % body fat (-3.00%, d = -0.44, p < 0.001); increased sit to stand leg strength repetitions (2.05, d = 0.48, p = 0.003); forward reach (3.59 cm, d = 0.61, p = 0.01); and right arm sagittal range of motion (6.50 degrees , d = 0.92, p = 0.05). To compare YE outcomes with the other two groups, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used. YE participants significantly outperformed C participants on "forward reach" (3.59 cm gained versus -2.44 cm lost), (p = 0.009) and outperformed CE participants (3.59 cm gained versus 1.35 cm gained), but not statistically significant. Our results support yoga-based exercise modified for breast cancer survivors as safe and effective.

UNLABELLED: People with knee osteoarthritis may benefit from exercise prescriptions that minimize knee loads in the frontal plane. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether a novel 12-week strengthening program designed to minimize exposure to the knee adduction moment (KAM) could improve symptoms and knee strength in women with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis. A secondary objective was to determine whether the program could improve mobility and fitness, and decrease peak KAM during gait. The tertiary objective was to evaluate the biomechanical characteristics of this yoga program. In particular, we compared the peak KAM during gait with that during yoga postures at baseline. We also compared lower limb normalized mean electromyography (EMG) amplitudes during yoga postures between baseline and follow-up. Primary measures included self-reported pain and physical function (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) and knee strength (extensor and flexor torques). Secondary measures included mobility (six-minute walk, 30-second chair stand, stair climbing), fitness (submaximal cycle ergometer test), and clinical gait analysis using motion capture synchronized with electromyography and force measurement. Also, KAM and normalized mean EMG amplitudes were collected during yoga postures. Forty-five women over age 50 with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis, consistent with the American College of Rheumatology criteria, enrolled in our 12-week (3 sessions per week) program. Data from 38 were analyzed (six drop-outs; one lost to co-intervention). Participants experienced reduced pain (mean improvement 10.1-20.1 normalized to 100; p<0.001), increased knee extensor strength (mean improvement 0.01 Nm/kg; p = 0.004), and increased flexor strength (mean improvement 0.01 Nm/kg; p = 0.001) at follow-up compared to baseline. Participants improved mobility on the six-minute walk (mean improvement 37.7 m; p<0.001) and 30-second chair stand (mean improvement 1.3; p = 0.006) at follow-up compared to baseline. Fitness and peak KAM during gait were unchanged between baseline and follow-up. Average KAM during the yoga postures were lower than that of normal gait. Normalized mean EMG amplitudes during yoga postures were up to 31.0% of maximum but did not change between baseline and follow-up. In this cohort study, the yoga-based strengthening postures that elicit low KAMs improved knee symptoms and strength in women with knee OA following a 12 week program (3 sessions per week). The program also improved mobility, but did not improve fitness or reduce peak KAM during gait. The KAM during the yoga postures were lower than that of normal gait. Overall, the proposed program may be useful in improving pain, strength, and mobility in women with knee osteoarthritis. Clinical efficacy needs to be assessed using a randomized controlled trial design. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02146105.

26366179	A Yoga Intervention for Posttraumatic Stress: A Preliminary Randomized Control Trial.	Yoga may be effective in the reduction of PTSD symptomology. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a Kundalini Yoga (KY) treatment on PTSD symptoms and overall wellbeing. To supplement the current field of inquiry, a pilot randomized control trial (RCT) was conducted comparing an 8-session KY intervention with a waitlist control group. 80 individuals with current PTSD symptoms participated. Both groups demonstrated changes in PTSD symptomology but yoga participants showed greater changes in measures of sleep, positive affect, perceived stress, anxiety, stress, and resilience. Between-groups effect sizes were small to moderate (0.09-0.25). KY may be an adjunctive or alternative intervention for PTSD. Findings indicate the need for further yoga research to better understand the mechanism of yoga in relation to mental and physical health, gender and ethnic comparisons, and short- and long-term yoga practice for psychiatric conditions.

26356561	Yoga and Emotion Regulation in High School Students: A Randomized Controlled Trial.	Middle adolescents (15-17 years old) are prone to increased risk taking and emotional instability. Emotion dysregulation contributes to a variety of psychosocial difficulties in this population. A discipline such as yoga offered during school may increase emotion regulation, but research in this area is lacking. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of a yoga intervention on the emotion regulation of high school students as compared to physical education (PE). In addition, the potential mediating effects of mindful attention, self-compassion, and body awareness on the relationship between yoga and emotion regulation were examined. High school students were randomized to participate in a 16-week yoga intervention (n = 19) or regular PE (n = 18). Pre-post data analyses revealed that emotion regulation increased significantly in the yoga group as compared to the PE group (F (1,32) = 7.50, p = .01, and eta(2) = .19). No significant relationship was discovered between the changes in emotion regulation and the proposed mediating variables. Preliminary results suggest that yoga increases emotion regulation capacities of middle adolescents and provides benefits beyond that of PE alone.

26347787	Yoga May Mitigate Decreases in High School Grades.	This study involves an exploratory examination of the effects of a 12-week school-based yoga intervention on changes in grade point average (GPA) in 9th and 10th grade students. Participants included 95 high school students who had registered for physical education (PE) in spring 2010. PE class sections were group randomized to receive either a yoga intervention or a PE-as-usual control condition. The yoga intervention took place during the entire third quarter and half of the fourth quarter of the school year, and quarterly GPA was collected via school records at the end of the school year. Results revealed a significant interaction between group and quarter suggesting that GPA differed between the yoga and control groups over time. Post hoc tests revealed that while both groups exhibited a general decline in GPA over the school year, the control group exhibited a significantly greater decline in GPA from quarter 1 to quarter 3 than the yoga group. Both groups showed equivalent declines in GPA in quarter 4 after the yoga intervention had ended. The results suggest that yoga may have a protective effect on academic performance by preventing declines in GPA; however these preventive effects may not persist once yoga practice is discontinued.

26311026	[Spirituality and ethics in psychosomatic medicine].	A patient has to cope with an illness on a physical, mental and spiritual level. There exists a difference between religiousness and spirituality even though the approach has a common foundation. Nonreligious spirituality relates to an inner experience, transcendent states of consciousness, meaningfulness, responsibility, sympathy, ethics, humanisation, faith. We encounter the spiritual point of view in humanistic psychotherapy, pastoral medicine, work of hospital chaplains, New Age, psychotherapies with religious and alternative aspects, transpersonal psychotherapy, psycho-spiritual crises, unusual states of consciousness, in meditation, Yoga, relaxation, kinesiology, ethicotherapy, reincarnation therapy, positive motivation, holotropic breathing, etc. There is description of different degrees of spiritual development, rational and irrational feeling of spirituality, Quantum Physics, spiritual intelligence, neuro-theology, physiological change, effects on improving adaptation during stress, drugs addiction, etc. Spirituality in relation with ethics is discussed in terms of socio-biology, evolution, emotions, aggressivity, genetics and social influence. The work analyses the effect of stressful situations on the deterioration of moral attitudes: during lack of time, obedience to authority and order. It is described how temperament and personality disorders can affect perception of spirituality, guilt feeling and conscience. Stressful situations, lack of time, relying only on the auxiliary objective methods leads to alienation of physician with a patient. Spirituality can partially improve the doctor-patient relationship, communication and sense of responsibility.	Irmis, Felix	2015
26294928	Preliminary Evidence That Yoga Practice Progressively Improves Mood and Decreases Stress in a Sample of UK Prisoners.	Objectives. In the first randomized controlled trial of yoga on UK prisoners, we previously showed that yoga practice was associated with improved mental wellbeing and cognition. Here, we aimed to assess how class attendance, self-practice, and demographic factors were related to outcome amongst prisoners enrolled in the 10-week yoga intervention. Methods. The data of 55 participants (52 male, 3 female) who completed a 10-week yoga course were analysed. Changes in pre- and postyoga measures of affect, perceived stress, and psychological symptoms were entered into linear regression analyses with bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap confidence intervals. Class attendance, self-practice, demographic variables, and baseline psychometric variables were included as regressors. Results. Participants who attended more yoga classes and those who engaged in frequent (5 times or more) self-practice reported significantly greater decreases in perceived stress. Decreases in negative affect were also significantly related to high frequency self-practice and greater class attendance at a near-significant level. Age was positively correlated with yoga class attendance, and higher levels of education were associated with greater decreases in negative affect. Conclusions. Our results suggest that there may be progressive beneficial effects of yoga within prison populations and point to subpopulations who may benefit the most from this practice.

26278074	The Effect of a Complex Multi-modality Ayurvedic Treatment in a Case of Unknown Female Infertility.	BACKGROUND: Treatment of female infertility has been growing globally in recent years. In spite of improvements in medical strategies and the improved outcomes for infertile couples, treatment attempts remain largely unsuccessful. A growing number of patients pursue complementary and alternative medicine treatment options like Ayurveda that offers a variety of inpatient and outpatient treatments for infertility. CASE REPORT: A case of a 38 year-old woman with infertility of unknown origin is presented. She received 18 conventional fertility treatments in 5 different fertility centers and 3 different countries. After several complications, the patient quitted conventional treatment and admitted to an Ayurvedic outpatient clinic where she received a complex Ayurvedic treatment, which included botanicals, dietary and lifestyle advice, manual therapy, yoga, and spiritual elements. The patient then became pregnant and gave birth to a healthy boy in 2012. CONCLUSIONS: Ayurveda may be a useful complementary option in the case of futile conventional treatment attempts in female infertility. Nevertheless, the evidence base for Ayurvedic interventions remains weak and requires well-designed clinical trials. This case raises some questions, such as whether the exposure to a large number of assisted reproduction procedures can lead to more health problems than health benefits. The Ayurvedic approach to fertility strives first to improve the health of the patient leading to a higher likelihood of pregnancy. As this is a case report, we are not able to exclude temporal factors stimulating the pregnancy. However, the chronology suggests that this approach might have been an important factor in the eventual pregnancy.

26246841	A Systematic Overview of Reviews for Complementary and Alternative Therapies in the Treatment of the Fibromyalgia Syndrome.	Objectives. This systematic overview of reviews aimed to summarize evidence and methodological quality from systematic reviews of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for the fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). Methods. The PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases were screened from their inception to Sept 2013 to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses of CAM interventions for FMS. Methodological quality of reviews was rated using the AMSTAR instrument. Results. Altogether 25 systematic reviews were found; they investigated the evidence of CAM in general, exercised-based CAM therapies, manipulative therapies, Mind/Body therapies, acupuncture, hydrotherapy, phytotherapy, and homeopathy. Methodological quality of reviews ranged from lowest to highest possible quality. Consistently positive results were found for tai chi, yoga, meditation and mindfulness-based interventions, hypnosis or guided imagery, electromyogram (EMG) biofeedback, and balneotherapy/hydrotherapy. Inconsistent results concerned qigong, acupuncture, chiropractic interventions, electroencephalogram (EEG) biofeedback, and nutritional supplements. Inconclusive results were found for homeopathy and phytotherapy. Major methodological flaws included missing details on data extraction process, included or excluded studies, study details, and adaption of conclusions based on quality assessment. Conclusions. Despite a growing body of scientific evidence of CAM therapies for the management of FMS systematic reviews still show methodological flaws limiting definite conclusions about their efficacy and safety.

26236107	Psychological Benefits of Nonpharmacological Methods Aimed for Improving Balance in Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a serious condition with a major negative impact on patient's physical and mental health. Postural instability is one of the cardinal difficulties reported by patients to deal with. Neuroanatomical, animal, and clinical studies on nonparkinsonian and parkinsonian subjects suggest an important correlation between the presence of balance dysfunction and multiple mood disorders, such as anxiety, depression, and apathy. Considering that balance dysfunction is a very common symptom in PD, we can presume that by its management we could positively influence patient's state of mind too. This review is an analysis of nonpharmacological methods shown to be effective and successful for improving balance in patients suffering from PD. Strategies such as general exercise, robotic assisted training, Tai Chi, Qi Gong, Yoga, dance (such as tango or ballet), box, virtual reality-based, or neurofeedback-based techniques and so forth can significantly improve the stability in these patients. Beside this physical outcome, many methods have also shown effect on quality of life, depression level, enjoyment, and motivation to continue in practicing the method independently. The purpose of this review is to provide information about practical and creative methods designed to improve balance in PD and highlight their positive impact on patient's psychology.

28620516	The impact of lifestyle modifications, diet, and vitamin supplementation on natural fertility.	BACKGROUND: Infertility is a relatively common condition. When patients are confronted with this diagnosis, there are medical, psychological, and financial sequelae. Patients often wonder if there is anything they can do to optimize their natural fertility or increase the effectiveness of infertility treatments. FINDINGS: If there is a clear impact on fertility, such as with smoking and alcohol, cessation should be advised. Similarly, weight loss should be recommended if the BMI is in the overweight and obese category, and weight gain should be recommended for an underweight BMI. The evidence surrounding other lifestyle modifications is less clear. There are conflicting data regarding an optimal fertility diet and consumption of vitamins and supplements. Antioxidants seem to improve semen parameters in men, but the effect on female fertility is less clear. If conflicting evidence exists, such as with caffeine consumption or exercise, moderation should be emphasized. Finally, the diagnosis of infertility and subsequent fertility treatments are stressful for both partners. The psychological aspects should not be ignored and methods such as yoga and cognitive behavioral therapy may be beneficial. CONCLUSION: Continued research will determine the optimal lifestyle modifications to achieve pregnancy.	Collins, Gretchen Garbe;Rossi, Brooke V	2015
26195914	Management of spastic cerebral palsy through multiple Ayurveda treatment modalities.	BACKGROUND: Cerebral palsy (CP) is a leading cause of childhood disability affecting function and development. The global incidence of CP is 2:1000. It has been reported that children with CP and their caretaker have impaired health-related quality of life (QOL). Of the many types and subtypes of CP, none has any known cure. For a detailed description of the disease CP, though, there is no one to one correlation in Ayurvedic classics; it can be taken as Vata Vyadhi as far as its etiology and symptomatology are concerned. AIM: To assess the effect of certain Panchakarma procedures in the management of CP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total 8 patients were registered and treated with 5 days of Udvartana, 5 days of Abhyanga followed by Sarvanga Swedana and then 8 days of Yoga Basti. The same course of treatment has been repeated for 3 times with an interval of 14 days. Ashtanga Ghrita was given during whole procedures as internal medication. Results of treatment were assessed with anthropometrical measurement, developmental milestone, Modified Ashworth Scale, spasm scale, reflex scale, and muscle power grading. RESULT: This Ayurvedic management shows good result in CP patients, especially by improving growth (height, weight, chest circumference) and development (head holding and sitting), reducing spasticity of left upper limb and muscle spasm. CONCLUSION: Multisystem approach is needed to improve the condition of the patient. Panchakarma along with internal medication should be given to improve all the facets of spastic CP. Yoga Basti acts by their own mode of action and can be used freely for such disease conditions.	Bhinde, Sagar M;Patel, Kalpana S;Kori, Virendra Kumar;Rajagopala, S	2014 Oct-Dec
26190986	Mindful movement and skilled attention.	Bodily movement has long been employed as a foundation for cultivating mental skills such as attention, self-control or mindfulness, with recent studies documenting the positive impacts of mindful movement training, such as yoga and tai chi. A parallel "mind-body connection" has also been observed in many developmental disorders. We elaborate a spectrum of mindfulness by considering ADHD, in which deficient motor control correlates with impaired (disinhibited) behavioral control contributing to defining features of excessive distractibility and impulsivity. These data provide evidence for an important axis of variation for wellbeing, in which skillful cognitive control covaries with a capacity for skillful movement. We review empirical and theoretical literature on attention, cognitive control, mind wandering, mindfulness and skill learning, endorsing a model of skilled attention in which motor plans, attention, and executive goals are seen as mutually co-defining aspects of skilled behavior that are linked by reciprocal inhibitory and excitatory connections. Thus, any movement training should engage "higher-order" inhibition and selection and develop a repertoire of rehearsed procedures that coordinate goals, attention and motor plans. However, we propose that mindful movement practice may improve the functional quality of rehearsed procedures, cultivating a transferrable skill of attention. We adopt Langer's spectrum of mindful learning that spans from "mindlessness" to engagement with the details of the present task and contrast this with the mental attitudes cultivated in standard mindfulness meditation. We particularly follow Feldenkrais' suggestion that mindful learning of skills for organizing the body in movement might transfer to other forms of mental activity. The results of mindful movement training should be observed in multiple complementary measures, and may have tremendous potential benefit for individuals with ADHD and other populations.

26182070	Balance Training with Wii Fit Plus for Community-Dwelling Persons 60 Years and Older.	OBJECTIVE: This study sought to determine the effect of 6 weeks of training, using activities from the Nintendo((R)) (Kyoto, Japan) "Wii Fit Plus" disc, on balance in community-dwelling Jamaicans 60 years and older. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single group pretest/posttest design was used. Thirty-three subjects enrolled and 28 completed the study. Participants completed 30-minute training sessions on the Nintendo "Wii Fit" twice per week for 6 weeks. Activities used included "Obstacle Course," "Penguin Slide," "Soccer Heading," "River Bubble," "Snow Board," "Tilt Table," "Skate Board," and "Yoga Single Tree Pose." Balance was assessed with the Berg Balance Scale, the Multi Directional Reach Test, the Star Excursion Balance Test and the Modified Clinical Test for Sensory Integration in Balance. RESULTS: There was significant improvement in the mean Berg Balance Scale score (P=0.004), Star Excursion Balance Test score (SEBT) (P<0.001 both legs), and Multi Directional Reach Test score (P=0.002). There was no significant change on the Modified Clinical Test for Sensory Integration in Balance. CONCLUSIONS: Balance games on the Nintendo "Wii Fit Plus" disc can be used as a tool for balance training in community-dwelling persons 60 years of age and older.

26170884	Yoga for Health-Related Quality of Life in Adult Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Feasibility Study.	An increase in patient-led uptake of complementary therapies in adult cancer has led to a need for more rigorous study of such interventions and their outcomes. This study therefore aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a yoga intervention in men and women receiving conventional treatment for a cancer diagnosis. Prospective, mixed methods feasibility trial allocated participants to receive one of three yoga interventions over a four-week study period. Data collection was completed through online survey of QOL-CA/CS and customized surveys. Fifteen participants were included (11 female) undergoing treatment for breast, prostate, colorectal, brain, and blood and lung cancer. Two participants dropped out and complete qualitative and quantitative data sets were collected from 12 participants and four yoga instructors. Other outcome measures included implementation costs patient-reported preferences for yoga intervention and changes in QOL-CA/CS. Three types of yoga intervention were safely administered in adult cancer. Mixed methods, cost-efficiency, QOL-CA/CS, and evidence-based design of yoga intervention have been used to establish feasibility and patient-preferences for yoga delivery in adult caner. Results suggest that, with some methodological improvements, a large-scale randomized controlled trial is warranted to test the efficacy of yoga for male and female cancer patients. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02309112.	McCall, Marcy;McDonald, Melanie;Thorne, Sally;Ward, Alison;Heneghan, Carl	2015
26167196	Effects of a 12-Week Hatha Yoga Intervention on Cardiorespiratory Endurance, Muscular Strength and Endurance, and Flexibility in Hong Kong Chinese Adults: A Controlled Clinical Trial.	Objective. To examine the effects of a 12-week Hatha yoga intervention on cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular strength and endurance, and flexibility in Chinese adults. Methods. 173 adults (aged 52.0 +/- 7.5 years) were assigned to either the yoga intervention group (n = 87) or the waitlist control group (n = 86). 19 dropped out from the study. Primary outcomes were changes in cardiorespiratory endurance (resting heart rate (HR) and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max)), muscular strength and endurance (curl-up and push-up tests), and lower back and hamstring flexibility (the modified back-saver sit-and-reach (MBS) test). Results. Compared to controls, the yoga group achieved significant improvements in VO2max (P < 0.01), curl-up (P < 0.05) and push-up (P < 0.001) tests, and the MBS left and right leg tests (both P < 0.001) in both genders. Significant change was also found for resting HR between groups in women (P < 0.05) but not in men. Further analysis comparing participants between younger and older subgroups yielded similar findings, except that the older participants in the yoga group failed to improve resting HR or the curl-up test versus control. Adherence (89%) and attendance (94%) were high. No serious adverse events occurred. Conclusion. A 12-week Hatha yoga intervention has favorable effects on cardiorespiratory endurance, muscular strength and endurance, and flexibility in Chinese adults.	Lau, Caren;Yu, Ruby;Woo, Jean	2015
26157387	Role of physical and mental training in brain network configuration.	It is hypothesized that the topology of brain networks is constructed by connecting nodes which may be continuously remodeled by appropriate training. Efficiency of physical and/or mental training on the brain relies on the flexibility of networks' architecture molded by local remodeling of proteins and synapses of excitatory neurons producing transformations in network topology. Continuous remodeling of proteins of excitatory neurons is fine-tuning the scaling and strength of excitatory synapses up or down via regulation of intra-cellular metabolic and regulatory networks of the genome-transcriptome-proteome interface. Alzheimer's disease is a model of "energy cost-driven small-world network disorder" with dysfunction of high-energy cost wiring as the network global efficiency is impaired by the deposition of an informed agent, the amyloid-beta, selectively targeting high-degree nodes. In schizophrenia, the interconnectivity and density of rich-club networks are significantly reduced. Training-induced homeostatic synaptogenesis-enhancement, presumably via reconfiguration of brain networks into greater small-worldness, appears essential in learning, memory, and executive functions. A macroscopic cartography of creation-removal of synaptic connections in a macro-network, and at the intra-cellular scale, micro-networks regulate the physiological mechanisms for the preferential attachment of synapses. The strongest molecular relationship of exercise and functional connectivity was identified for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The allele variant, rs7294919, also shows a powerful relationship with the hippocampal volume. How the brain achieves this unique quest of reconfiguration remains a puzzle. What are the underlying mechanisms of synaptogenesis promoting communications brain <--> muscle and brain <--> brain in such trainings? What is the respective role of independent mental, physical, or combined-mental-physical trainings? Physical practice seems to be playing an instrumental role in the cognitive enhancement (brain <--> muscle com.). However, mental training, meditation or virtual reality (films, games) require only minimal motor activity and cardio-respiratory stimulation. Therefore, other potential paths (brain <--> brain com.) molding brain networks are nonetheless essential. Patients with motor neuron disease/injury (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatism) also achieve successful cognitive enhancement albeit they may only elicit mental practice.

26155717	The Effects of Yoga Participation on Women's Quality of Life and Symptom Management During the Menopausal Transition: A Pilot Study.	Typically lasting 5-10 years, the menopausal transition is associated with symptoms including hot flashes, night sweats, and labile mood. As these symptoms often hinder a woman's successful functioning in everyday life, hormone therapy is commonly prescribed as a means to diminish symptoms. Many women, however, are seeking complementary and alternative treatments due to side effects and/or detrimental health-risks associated with conventional therapies. We completed a mixed methods study to determine changes in physiological symptoms associated with menopause and changes in women's quality of life, as a result of participation in a 10-week yoga intervention.

26151021	Mainstreaming of Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy with the health care delivery system in India.	India has a population of 1.21 billion people and there is a high degree of socio-cultural, linguistic, and demographic heterogeneity. There is a limited number of health care professionals, especially doctors, per head of population. The National Rural Health Mission has decided to mainstream the Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy (AYUSH) system of indigenous medicine to help meet the challenge of this shortage of health care professionals and to strengthen the delivery system of the health care service. Multiple interventions have been implemented to ensure a systematic merger; however, the anticipated results have not been achieved as a result of multiple challenges and barriers. To ensure the accessibility and availability of health care services to all, policy-makers need to implement strategies to facilitate the mainstreaming of the AYUSH system and to support this system with stringent monitoring mechanisms.

26151012	Can naturopathy provide answers to the escalating health care costs in India?	There are substantial areas of overlap between naturopathy and public health, which include a focus on health rather than disease, a preventive approach, and an emphasis on health promotion and health education. Public health can look to naturopathy for answers to the emergence of chronic disease through natural therapies, many of which can take the role of primordial and primary prevention of several diseases. Some selected naturopathic therapies include nutrition, hydrotherapy, fasting therapy, yoga, behavioral therapy, and health promotion. We must reorient our focus on prevention and wellness to make a true impact on escalating health care costs. With the National Health Policy in India emphasizing the need for integrating the Indian Systems of Medicines with modern medicine, now is the right time for naturopathy and public health to come together to provide a holistic health care system.

26146618	The Meditative Mind: A Comprehensive Meta-Analysis of MRI Studies.	Over the past decade mind and body practices, such as yoga and meditation, have raised interest in different scientific fields; in particular, the physiological mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects observed in meditators have been investigated. Neuroimaging studies have studied the effects of meditation on brain structure and function and findings have helped clarify the biological underpinnings of the positive effects of meditation practice and the possible integration of this technique in standard therapy. The large amount of data collected thus far allows drawing some conclusions about the neural effects of meditation practice. In the present study we used activation likelihood estimation (ALE) analysis to make a coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging data on the effects of meditation on brain structure and function. Results indicate that meditation leads to activation in brain areas involved in processing self-relevant information, self-regulation, focused problem-solving, adaptive behavior, and interoception. Results also show that meditation practice induces functional and structural brain modifications in expert meditators, especially in areas involved in self-referential processes such as self-awareness and self-regulation. These results demonstrate that a biological substrate underlies the positive pervasive effect of meditation practice and suggest that meditation techniques could be adopted in clinical populations and to prevent disease.

26118705	[Effects of prenatal yoga: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials].	OBJECTIVES: While several studies on the preventive and therapeutic effects of prenatal yoga (maternity yoga) have been reported in recent years, there has been no systematic review on the effects of prenatal yoga based on randomized controlled trials (RCT). The purpose of this study, therefore, was to systematically review the literature to clarify the effects of prenatal yoga in RCT focusing on the contents of the intervention, the intervention means, and the frequency of practice. METHODS: The literature search was performed using the electronic database, PubMed. The inclusion criteria were RCT, pregnant women, and yoga intervention. RESULTS: In total, 54 citations were found; of these, eight studies (10 reports) were included in the final analysis. In four studies on healthy pregnant women, significant improvement in pain and pleasure at delivery, duration of delivery, perceived stress levels during pregnancy, anxiety levels, depression, pregnancy-related experiences, quality of life, and interpersonal relationships were compared to those in the control group. In two studies on depressed pregnant women, one reported that depression, anxiety levels, anger levels, leg pain, and back pain significantly improved with yoga, while the other found no differences from the control group. In one study of high-risk pregnant women with morbidity factors such as obesity or advanced age, yoga resulted in significantly fewer cases of pregnancy-induced hypertension, gestational diabetes, and intrauterine growth restriction, as well as a decrease in perceived stress levels. In one study on pregnant women with pelvic pain, the median pain score was lower in the yoga group. Regarding the contents of the intervention, while the two studies for depressed pregnant women only included physical postures, the remaining six studies also included breathing technique and meditation. Interventions were performed using lectures by instructors alone or together with self-teaching. The frequency of the intervention varied within each study. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that prenatal yoga may help reduce pelvic pain. It may also improve mental condition (stress, depression, anxiety, etc.), physical condition (pain and pleasure at the delivery, etc.), and perinatal outcomes (obstetrical complications, delivery time, etc.). However, further studies are needed. The contents of the intervention, the intervention means, and the frequency varied with each study. Thus, it is necessary to further examine the content of effective interventions, intervention means, and frequency that suit participant's characteristics and each outcome. Further research in this field, particularly randomized controlled trials, is merited.

26118514	Sirsasana (headstand) technique alters head/neck loading: Considerations for safety.	BACKGROUND: This study examined the weight-bearing responsibility of the head and neck at moments of peak force during three headstand techniques. METHODS: Three matched groups of 15 each (18-60 years old) were formed based upon lower limb entry/exit technique: symmetrical extended, symmetrical flexed, and asymmetrical flexed. All 45 practitioners performed 3 headstands. Kinematics and kinetics were analyzed to locate peak forces acting on the head, loading rate, center of pressure (COP) and cervical alignment. FINDINGS: During entry, symmetrical extended leg position trended towards the lowest loads as compared to asymmetrical or symmetrical flexed legs (Cohen's d = 0.53 and 0.39 respectively). Also, symmetrical extended condition produced slower loading rates and more neutral cervical conditions during loading. INTERPRETATION: Subjects loaded the head with maximums of 40-48% of total body weight. The data support the conclusion that entering the posture with straight legs together may reduce the load and the rate of change of that load.	Hector, Rachel;Jensen, Jody L	2015 Jul
26111165	Effects of a 12-Week Hatha Yoga Intervention on Metabolic Risk and Quality of Life in Hong Kong Chinese Adults with and without Metabolic Syndrome.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of a 12-week Hatha yoga intervention to improve metabolic risk profiles and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in Chinese adults with and without metabolic syndrome (MetS). METHODS: We conducted a controlled trial within an university-affiliated hospital. 173 Chinese men and women aged 18 or above were assigned to either the yoga intervention group (n = 87) or the control group (n = 86). Primary outcomes included 12-week change in metabolic risk factors and MetS z score. Secondary outcome was HRQoL (Medical Outcomes Short Form Survey at 12 weeks). RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 52.0 (SD 7.4, range 31-71) years. Analysis involving the entire study population revealed that the yoga group achieved greater decline in waist circumference (p<0.001), fasting glucose (p<0.01), triglycerides (p<0.05), and MetS z score (p<0.01). Yoga training also improved general health perceptions (p<0.01), physical component score (p<0.01), and social functioning (p<0.01) domains score of HRQoL. However, no significant differences between groups were observed in the mean change of systolic/diastolic blood pressures or high-density lipid protein cholesterol (all p>0.05). There were no significant differences in the intervention effects on waist circumference and MetS z score between the MetS subgroups (both p>0.05). CONCLUSION: A 12-week Hatha yoga intervention improves metabolic risk profiles and HRQoL in Chinese adults with and without MetS.

26107256	Ashtanga-Based Yoga Therapy Increases the Sensory Contribution to Postural Stability in Visually-Impaired Persons at Risk for Falls as Measured by the Wii Balance Board: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.	OBJECTIVE: Persons with visual impairment (VI) are at greater risk for falls due to irreparable damage to visual sensory input contributing to balance. Targeted training may significantly improve postural stability by strengthening the remaining sensory systems. Here, we evaluate the Ashtanga-based Yoga Therapy (AYT) program as a multi-sensory behavioral intervention to develop postural stability in VI. DESIGN: A randomized, waitlist-controlled, single-blind clinical trial. METHODS: The trial was conducted between October 2012 and December 2013. Twenty-one legally blind participants were randomized to an 8-week AYT program (n = 11, mean (SD) age = 55(17)) or waitlist control (n=10, mean (SD) age = 55(10)). AYT subjects convened for one group session at a local yoga studio with an instructor and two individual home-based practice sessions per week for a total of 8 weeks. Subjects completed outcome measures at baseline and post-8 weeks of AYT. The primary outcome, absolute Center of Pressure (COP), was derived from the Wii Balance Board (WBB), a standalone posturography device, in 4 sensory conditions: firm surface, eyes open (EO); firm surface, eyes closed (EC); foam surface, EO; and foam surface, EC. Stabilization Indices (SI) were computed from COP measures to determine the relative visual (SIfirm, SIfoam), somatosensory (SIEO, SIEC) and vestibular (SIV, i.e., FoamEC vs. FirmEO) contributions to balance. This study was not powered to detect between group differences, so significance of pre-post changes was assessed by paired samples t-tests within each group. RESULTS: Groups were equivalent at baseline (all p > 0.05). In the AYT group, absolute COP significantly increased in the FoamEO (t(8) = -3.66, p = 0.01) and FoamEC (t(8) = -3.90, p = 0.01) conditions. Relative somatosensory SIEO (t(8) = -2.42, p = 0.04) and SIEC (t(8) = -3.96, p = 0.01), and vestibular SIV (t(8) = -2.47, p = 0.04) contributions to balance increased significantly. As expected, no significant changes from EO to EC conditions were found indicating an absence of visual dependency in VI. No significant pre-post changes were observed in the control group (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results establish the potential for AYT training to develop the remaining somatosensory and vestibular responses used to optimize postural stability in a VI population.

26106345	Interoception, contemplative practice, and health.	Interoception can be broadly defined as the sense of signals originating within the body. As such, interoception is critical for our sense of embodiment, motivation, and well-being. And yet, despite its importance, interoception remains poorly understood within modern science. This paper reviews interdisciplinary perspectives on interoception, with the goal of presenting a unified perspective from diverse fields such as neuroscience, clinical practice, and contemplative studies. It is hoped that this integrative effort will advance our understanding of how interoception determines well-being, and identify the central challenges to such understanding. To this end, we introduce an expanded taxonomy of interoceptive processes, arguing that many of these processes can be understood through an emerging predictive coding model for mind-body integration. The model, which describes the tension between expected and felt body sensation, parallels contemplative theories, and implicates interoception in a variety of affective and psychosomatic disorders. We conclude that maladaptive construal of bodily sensations may lie at the heart of many contemporary maladies, and that contemplative practices may attenuate these interpretative biases, restoring a person's sense of presence and agency in the world.

26086029	The impact of mind-body awareness training on the early learning of a brain-computer interface.	Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems allow users to interact with their environment by bypassing muscular control to tap directly into the users' thoughts. In the present study, we investigate the role of prior experience with yoga and meditation, examples of formalized mind-body awareness training (MBAT), in learning to use a one-dimensional sensorimotor rhythm based BCI. Thirty-six human subjects volunteered to participate in two different cohorts based on past experience with MBAT - experienced MBAT practitioners and controls. All subjects participated in three BCI experiments to achieve competency in controlling the BCI system. The MBAT cohort achieved BCI competency significantly faster than the control cohort. In addition, the MBAT cohort demonstrated enhanced ability to control the system on various measures of BCI performance and improved significantly more over time when compared to control. Our work provides insight into valuable strategies for reducing barriers to BCI fluency that limit the more widespread use of these systems.	Cassady, Kaitlin;You, Albert;Doud, Alex;He, Bin	2014 Sep
26083564	Limited Health Knowledge as a Reason for Non-Use of Four Common Complementary Health Practices.	BACKGROUND: Complementary health practices are an important element of health/healthcare seeking behavior among adults in the United States. Reasons for use include medical need, prevention and wellness promotion, and cultural relevance. Survey studies published over the past several decades have provided important information on the use of complementary health practices, such as acupuncture and yoga. A review of the literature, however, reveals an absence of studies looking specifically at who does not use these approaches, and why not. METHODS: To explore this issue two samples were created using data from the 2007 National Health Interview Survey Complementary and Alternative Medicine supplement. Of particular interest was the relationship between lack of health knowledge, as a reason for non-use, and key independent variables. The first sample was comprised of individuals who had never used any of four common complementary health practices -- acupuncture, chiropractic, natural products, and yoga. The second was a subset of those same non-users who had also reported low back pain, the most frequently cited health concern related to use of complementary therapies. RESULTS: A hypothesized association between lack of health knowledge, lower educational attainment, and other key socioeconomic indicators was supported in the findings. Although it was hypothesized that low back pain would be associated with greater information seeking, regardless of level of education, that hypothesis was not supported. CONCLUSION: Lack of knowledge was found to affect utilization of common complementary health practices, regardless of the potentially motivating presence of back pain. Disparities in the utilization of complementary medicine, related to educational attainment and other socioeconomic factors, may negatively affect quality of care for many Americans. Creative approaches are needed to help reduce inequities in understanding and improve access to care for underserved populations.	Burke, Adam;Nahin, Richard L;Stussman, Barbara J	2015
26064164	Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Yoga as Remedial Therapy.	Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a group of symptoms manifesting as a functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder in which patients experience abdominal pain, discomfort, and bloating that is often relieved with defecation. IBS is often associated with a host of secondary comorbidities such as anxiety, depression, headaches, and fatigue. In this review, we examined the basic principles of Pancha Kosha (five sheaths of human existence) concept from an Indian scripture Taittiriya Upanishad and the pathophysiology of a disease from the Yoga approach, Yoga Vasistha's Adhi (originated from mind) and Vyadhi (ailment/disease) concept. An analogy between the age old, the most profound concept of Adhi-Vyadhi, and modern scientific stress-induced dysregulation of brain-gut axis, as it relates to IBS that could pave way for impacting IBS, is emphasized. Based on these perspectives, a plausible Yoga module as a remedial therapy is provided to better manage the primary and secondary symptoms of IBS.

26053053	Meditative Movement Therapies and Health-Related Quality-of-Life in Adults: A Systematic Review of Meta-Analyses.	Poor health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) is a significant public health issue while the use of meditative movement therapies has been increasing. The purpose of this investigation was to carry out a systematic review of previous meta-analyses that examined the effects of meditative movement therapies (yoga, tai chi and qigong) on HRQOL in adults. Previous meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials published up through February, 2014 were included by searching nine electronic databases and cross-referencing. Dual-selection and data abstraction occurred. The Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews Instrument (AMSTAR) was used to assess methodological quality. Standardized mean differences that were pooled using random-effects models were included. In addition, 95% prediction intervals were calculated as well as the number needed-to-treat and percentile improvements. Of the 510 citations screened, 10 meta-analyses representing a median of 3 standardized mean differences in 82 to 528 participants (median = 270) with breast cancer, schizophrenia, low back pain, heart failure and diabetes, were included. Median methodological quality was 70%. Median length, frequency and duration of the meditative movement therapies were 12 weeks, 3 times per week, for 71 minutes per session. The majority of results (78.9%) favored statistically significant improvements (non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals) in HRQOL, with standardized mean differences ranging from 0.18 to 2.28. More than half of the results yielded statistically significant heterogeneity (Q </= 0.10) and large or very large inconsistency (I2 >/= 50%). All 95% prediction intervals included zero. The number-needed-to-treat ranged from 2 to 10 while percentile improvements ranged from 9.9 to 48.9. The results of this study suggest that meditative movement therapies may improve HRQOL in adults with selected conditions. However, a need exists for a large, more inclusive meta-analysis (PROSPERO Registration #CRD42014014576).	Kelley, George A;Kelley, Kristi S	2015
26034728	The effect of group mindfulness - based stress reduction program and conscious yoga on the fatigue severity and global and specific life quality in women with breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: Cancer is not merely an event with a certain end, but it is a permanent and vague situation that is determined by delayed effects due to the disease, its treatment and its related psychological issues. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of the mindfulness-based stress reduction program and conscious yoga on the mental fatigue severity and life quality of women with breast cancer. METHODS: This was a quasi-experimental study with a pre-test, post-test and control group. In this study, 24 patients with the diagnosis of breast cancer were selected among the patients who referred to the Division of Oncology and Radiotherapy of Imam Hossein hospital in Tehran using available sampling method, and were randomly assigned into the experimental and control groups. All the participants completed the Fatigue Severity Scale, Global Life Quality of Cancer Patient and Specific Life Quality of Cancer Patient questionnaires. Data were analyzed by multivariate repeated measurement variance analysis model. RESULTS: Findings revealed that the mindfulness-based stress reduction treatment significantly improved the overall quality of life, role, cognitive, emotion, social functions and pain and fatigue symptoms in global life quality in the experimental group. It also significantly improved the body image, future functions and therapy side effects in specific life quality of the experimental group compared to the control group. In addition, fatigue severity caused by cancer was reduced significantly. CONCLUSION: The results showed that the mindfulness - based stress reduction treatment can be effective in improving global and specific life quality and fatigue severity in women with breast cancer.

26029093	Neuroprotective effects of yoga practice: age-, experience-, and frequency-dependent plasticity.	Yoga combines postures, breathing, and meditation. Despite reported health benefits, yoga's effects on the brain have received little study. We used magnetic resonance imaging to compare age-related gray matter (GM) decline in yogis and controls. We also examined the effect of increasing yoga experience and weekly practice on GM volume and assessed which aspects of weekly practice contributed most to brain size. Controls displayed the well documented age-related global brain GM decline while yogis did not, suggesting that yoga contributes to protect the brain against age-related decline. Years of yoga experience correlated mostly with GM volume differences in the left hemisphere (insula, frontal operculum, and orbitofrontal cortex) suggesting that yoga tunes the brain toward a parasympatically driven mode and positive states. The number of hours of weekly practice correlated with GM volume in the primary somatosensory cortex/superior parietal lobule (S1/SPL), precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), hippocampus, and primary visual cortex (V1). Commonality analyses indicated that the combination of postures and meditation contributed the most to the size of the hippocampus, precuneus/PCC, and S1/SPL while the combination of meditation and breathing exercises contributed the most to V1 volume. Yoga's potential neuroprotective effects may provide a neural basis for some of its beneficial effects.	Villemure, Chantal;Ceko, Marta;Cotton, Valerie A;Bushnell, M Catherine	2015
26016365	Effect of acclimation training on physiological changes in a randomized controlled trial in hot-humid environment.	OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to explore the physiological changes and the effect of heat acclimation training via a randomized control trial study. METHODS: Forty healthy male volunteers were chosen and divided into experimental group and control group randomly. Those in experimental group received heat acclimation training including but not limited to meditation, unarmed run, yoga, and stepping in hot lab environment. And then, subjective feeling, rectal temperature, average skin temperature, and sweat electrolytes concentration were detected in order to describe their physiological changes. Before and after the training, both groups received some tests and their 3 000 m run-race time, nervous reaction time and subjective perception scores were recorded to evaluate the effect of acclimation training. RESULTS: (1) There was no difference in 3 000 m between the 2 groups in the same environment. Subjects' 3 000 m race time in experimental group was obviously shortened than that in control group in room temperature environment (t = 2.326, P < 0.05). And subjects' 3 000 m race time in experimental group was obviously shortened than that in control group in hot-humid environment (t = 4.518, P < 0.01). (2) Subjects' reaction time (RT) in experimental group was shortened than that in control group in room temperature environment (Z = 11.258, P < 0.05). And Subjects' RT in experimental group was sharply shortened than that in control group in hot-humid environment (Z = 6.519, P < 0.01). (3) No difference between the experimental and control groups was observed in subjective perception score (SPS) in room temperature environment. But subjects' SPS in experimental group was obviously lowered than that in control group and in hot-humid environment (t = 17.958, P < 0.01).(4) Anal temperature (AT) was lowered during training, while the change of mean skin temperature (MST) was not significant. Sweat sodium concentration (SSC) was lowered during training. SPS continued to decrease and entered plateau on the 13th day after training.(5) After acclimation training, the working capacity of the experimental group in hot-humid environment was over 85% of that in room temperature environment. While subjects' working capacity in control group in hot-humid environment was about 80% of that in room temperature environment. CONCLUSION: Hot-humid environment acclimation training improved the working capacity. After training, subjects' working capacity in hot-humid environment remained over 85% of that in room temperature environment, which was higher than that of those subjects who did not take part in training.

26010373	Prevalence and Predictors of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) Use Among Ivy League College Students: Implications for Student Health Services.	OBJECTIVE: Determine prevalence and types of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies used and test the significance of demographics and social cognitive constructs as predictors of CAM use in a college sample. Secondary purpose was to guide the integration of CAM therapies into college health services. PARTICIPANTS: Random, stratified sample of 2,553 undergraduates and graduate students enrolled at Columbia University. METHODS: Web-based survey e-mailed to a random sample of 6,482 students. Regression analyses used to determine predictors of CAM use. RESULTS: Nearly 82% of respondents reported using at least 1 form of CAM in the last 12 months, the most common being nonvitamin, nonmineral (NVNM) products, yoga, deep breathing exercises, massage therapy, and meditation. Sex, student home origin, outcome expectancies, observational learning, and attitude toward CAM were found as significant predictors of CAM use. CONCLUSIONS: Ongoing assessment of CAM use can assist administrators and providers to enhance college health services and programs.

26005409	Neurophysiological and neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the effects of yoga-based practices: towards a comprehensive theoretical framework.	During recent decades numerous yoga-based practices (YBP) have emerged in the West, with their aims ranging from fitness gains to therapeutic benefits and spiritual development. Yoga is also beginning to spark growing interest within the scientific community, and yoga-based interventions have been associated with measureable changes in physiological parameters, perceived emotional states, and cognitive functioning. YBP typically involve a combination of postures or movement sequences, conscious regulation of the breath, and various techniques to improve attentional focus. However, so far little if any research has attempted to deconstruct the role of these different component parts in order to better understand their respective contribution to the effects of YBP. A clear operational definition of yoga-based therapeutic interventions for scientific purposes, as well as a comprehensive theoretical framework from which testable hypotheses can be formulated, is therefore needed. Here we propose such a framework, and outline the bottom-up neurophysiological and top-down neurocognitive mechanisms hypothesized to be at play in YBP.

26000038	Effects of 1-year yoga on cardiovascular risk factors in middle-aged and older adults with metabolic syndrome: a randomized trial.	BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a clustering of cardiovascular risk factors, which is associated with diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Lifestyle interventions applied to people with MetS has considerable beneficial effects on disease preventive outcomes. This study aimed to examine the effects of 1-year of yoga exercise on the cardiovascular risk factors including central obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia in middle-aged and older Hong Kong Chinese adults with MetS. METHODS: Adults diagnosed with MetS using National Cholesterol Education Program criteria (n = 182; mean +/- SD age = 56 +/- 9.1) were randomly assigned to a 1-year yoga intervention group or control group. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were examined at baseline, midway, and on completion of the study. Physical activity level and caloric intake were assessed and included in the covariate analyses. RESULTS: A reduction of the number of diagnostic components for MetS was found to be associated with the yoga intervention. Waist circumference was significantly improved after the 1-year yoga intervention. A trend towards a decrease in systolic blood pressure was observed following yoga intervention. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that yoga exercise improves the cardiovascular risk factors including central obesity and blood pressure in middle-aged and older adults with MetS. These findings support the complementary beneficial role of yoga in managing MetS.	Siu, Parco M;Yu, Angus P;Benzie, Iris F;Woo, Jean	2015
25983675	Yoga as a method of symptom management in multiple sclerosis.	Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated process in which the body's immune system damages myelin in the central nervous system (CNS). The onset of this disorder typically occurs in young adults, and it is more common among women. Currently, there is no cure and the long-term disease progression makes symptomatic management critical for maintaining quality of life. Several pharmacotherapeutic agents are approved for treatment, but many patients seek complementary and alternative interventions. Reviews have been conducted regarding broad topics such as mindfulness-based interventions for people diagnosed with MS and the impact of yoga on a range of neurological disorders. The objective of the present review is to examine the potential benefits of yoga for individuals with MS and address its use in managing symptoms including pain, mental health, fatigue, spasticity, balance, bladder control, and sexual function.

25973923	Slow breathing and hypoxic challenge: cardiorespiratory consequences and their central neural substrates.	Controlled slow breathing (at 6/min, a rate frequently adopted during yoga practice) can benefit cardiovascular function, including responses to hypoxia. We tested the neural substrates of cardiorespiratory control in humans during volitional controlled breathing and hypoxic challenge using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty healthy volunteers were scanned during paced (slow and normal rate) breathing and during spontaneous breathing of normoxic and hypoxic (13% inspired O2) air. Cardiovascular and respiratory measures were acquired concurrently, including beat-to-beat blood pressure from a subset of participants (N = 7). Slow breathing was associated with increased tidal ventilatory volume. Induced hypoxia raised heart rate and suppressed heart rate variability. Within the brain, slow breathing activated dorsal pons, periaqueductal grey matter, cerebellum, hypothalamus, thalamus and lateral and anterior insular cortices. Blocks of hypoxia activated mid pons, bilateral amygdalae, anterior insular and occipitotemporal cortices. Interaction between slow breathing and hypoxia was expressed in ventral striatal and frontal polar activity. Across conditions, within brainstem, dorsal medullary and pontine activity correlated with tidal volume and inversely with heart rate. Activity in rostroventral medulla correlated with beat-to-beat blood pressure and heart rate variability. Widespread insula and striatal activity tracked decreases in heart rate, while subregions of insular cortex correlated with momentary increases in tidal volume. Our findings define slow breathing effects on central and cardiovascular responses to hypoxic challenge. They highlight the recruitment of discrete brainstem nuclei to cardiorespiratory control, and the engagement of corticostriatal circuitry in support of physiological responses that accompany breathing regulation during hypoxic challenge.

25952547	The Effects of a Hatha Yoga Intervention on Facets of Distress Tolerance.	Individuals with low distress tolerance (DT) experience negative emotion as particularly threatening and are highly motivated to reduce or avoid such affective experiences. Consequently, these individuals have difficulty regulating emotions and tend to engage in maladaptive strategies, such as overeating, as a means to reduce or avoid distress. Hatha yoga encourages one to implement present-centered awareness and non-reaction in the face of physical and psychological discomfort and, thus, emerges as a potential strategy for increasing DT. To test whether a hatha yoga intervention can enhance DT, a transdiagnostic risk and maintenance factor, this study randomly assigned females high in emotional eating in response to stress (N = 52) either to an 8-week, twice-weekly hatha (Bikram) yoga intervention or to a waitlist control condition. Self-reported DT and emotional eating were measured at baseline, weekly during treatment, and 1-week post-treatment. Consistent with prediction, participants in the yoga condition reported greater increases in DT over the course of the intervention relative to waitlist participants (Cohen's d = .82). Also consistent with prediction, the reduction in emotional eating was greater for the yoga condition than the waitlist condition (Cohen's d = .92). Importantly, reductions distress absorption, a specific sub-facet of DT, accounted for 15% of the variance in emotional eating, a hallmark behavior of eating pathology and risk factor for obesity.

25906618	Effect of yogic training on physiological variables in working women.	Depression and anxiety in women sharply rising. Working women have high level of stress than non working women. Increasing amount of work stress at home and work place and its impact on family and home environment can be seen, which affect their emotional, psychological and physical health. The concept of yoga is helpful for reducing anxiety and improving cardiorespiratory parameters has created a great interest in the medical research field. The present study was conducted to assessing the effect of yogic exercises and meditation in working women. Yogic session was carried out for 16 weeks. Cardiorespiratory parameters (pulse rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure and breath holding time) were measured before and after yoga training. Stress was measured by anxiety score as an indicator of stress, also Visual reaction time as an indicator of cognitive function and finger dexterity score as an indicator of motor skills were measured before and after yoga training. Statistical analysis was done by paired 't' test. It was found that statistically significant improvement in cardiorespiratory parameters, anxiety score, visual reaction time and finger dexterity score (P < 0.05) after yogic training. Thus, a combined practice of asana, breathing exercises, and meditation & relaxation technique in a sequence is the best available resource to meet the.present day needs of society.

25906606	Efficacy of naturopathy and yoga in bronchial asthma.	The aim of the study was to test the efficacy of a one month in-patient naturopathy and yoga programme for patients with asthma. Retrospective data of 159 bronchial asthma patients, undergoing the naturopathy and yoga programme, was analyzed for Forced Vital Capacity, Forced Expiratory Volume at the end of 1 second, Maximum Voluntary Ventilation and Peak Expiratory Flow Rate on admission, 11th day, on discharge and once in three months for three years. The paired sample t test results showed significant increase in the Forced Vital Capacity and Forced Expiratory Volume from the date of admission up to 6th month (P < 0.0035) post Bonferroni correction. Maximum Voluntary Ventilation significantly increased from admission till the date of discharge (P < 0.0035) and Peak Expiratory Flow Rate significantly increased from admission till the 36th month of follow-up (P < 0.0035), post Bonferroni correction. This validated the beneficial effect of combining naturopathy and yoga for the management of bronchial asthma.

25906603	Effect of controlled breathing exercises on the psychological status and the cardiac autonomic tone: Sudarshan Kriya and Prana-Yoga.	OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to observe the effect of controlled breathing exercises including Sudarshan Kriya (SK) and Prana-Yoga (PY) on the psycho-physiological status. METHODS: The study group included 60 healthy volunteers (M:30, F:30) in the age group of 18 to 30 years (21.3 +/- 3.2 yrs), randomly divided in to three groups of 20 subjects each--(1) The SK group (2) the PY group and the (3) Control group. The psycho-physiological data was collected at the following four time interventions: Baseline, 6th, 60th and the 150th day. Psychological assessment was done using questionnaires and for the autonomic tone quantification Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis was done using the standard lead II electrocardiogram recordings. In a post-hoc analysis each group was further sub divided in to the following two patterns, based on the baseline values of normalized Low Frequency (LF) power (cutoff 64 ms2): (i) Pattern A-Subjects with low level LF power, and (ii) Pattern B- subjects with high level LF power. RESULTS: The stress management skills have shown significant increase in SK group but not in PY and Control group. Subjects of SK, PY, and control group showed significant increase in LF value and LF:HF ratio for pattern A and significant decrease for pattern B. Plotted LF value for pattern A & B in SK and PY practitioners showed convergence, coming to a mean value over the period of 150 days. The LF:HF ratio curve plotted over time for pattern A & B showed convergence in SK group only. No such convergence in LF value & LF/HF ratio for pattern A & B was seen in control group. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, Sudarshan Kriya positively modifies stress coping behavior and initiates appropriate balance in cardiac autonomic tone.

25878456	Health sector reforms for 21(st) century healthcare.	The form of the public health system in India is a three tiered pyramid-like structure consisting primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare services. The content of India's health system is mono-cultural and based on western bio-medicine. Authors discuss need for health sector reforms in the wake of the fact that despite huge investment, the public health system is not delivering. Today, 70% of the population pays out of pocket for even primary healthcare. Innovation is the need of the hour. The Indian government has recognized eight systems of healthcare viz., Allopathy, Ayurveda, Siddha, Swa-rigpa, Unani, Naturopathy, Homeopathy, and Yoga. Allopathy receives 97% of the national health budget, and 3% is divided amongst the remaining seven systems. At present, skewed funding and poor integration denies the public of advantage of synergy and innovations arising out of the richness of India's Medical Heritage. Health seeking behavior studies reveal that 40-70% of the population exercise pluralistic choices and seek health services for different needs, from different systems. For emergency and surgery, Allopathy is the first choice but for chronic and common ailments and for prevention and wellness help from the other seven systems is sought. Integrative healthcare appears to be the future framework for healthcare in the 21(st) century. A long-term strategy involving radical changes in medical education, research, clinical practice, public health and the legal and regulatory framework is needed, to innovate India's public health system and make it both integrative and participatory. India can be a world leader in the new emerging field of "integrative healthcare" because we have over the last century or so assimilated and achieved a reasonable degree of competence in bio-medical and life sciences and we possess an incredibly rich and varied medical heritage of our own.

25873979	Alterations in Salivary Proteome following Single Twenty-Minute Session of Yogic Breathing.	Yogic breathing (YB) has been suggested to reduce stress and blood pressure and increase cognitive processes. However, alterations after YB at the molecular level are not well established. Twenty healthy volunteers were randomized into two groups (N = 10 per group): YB or attention controls (AC). The YB group performed two YB exercises, each for ten minutes, for a total of twenty minutes in a single session. AC group read a text of their choice for 20 minutes. Saliva was collected at baseline and at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes. Using Mass Spectrometry (MS), we initially found that 22 proteins were differentially expressed and then validated deleted in malignant brain tumor-1 (DMBT1) and Ig lambda-2 chain C region (IGLC2) using Western Blotting. DMBT1 was elevated in 7 of YB group by 10-fold and 11-fold at 10 and 15 minutes, respectively, whereas it was undetectable in the time-matched AC group (P < 0.05). There was a significant interaction between groups and time assessed by two-way ANOVA (P < 0.001). IGLC2 also showed a significant increase in YB group as measured by Western Blotting. These data are the first to demonstrate the feasibility of stimulating and detecting salivary protein biomarkers in response to an acute Yoga exercise. This trial is registered with ClincalTrials.gov NCT02108769.	Balasubramanian, Sundaravadivel;Janech, Michael G;Warren, Graham W	2015
25858659	Yoga as the "next wave" of therapeutic modalities for treatment of insomnia.	Insomnia rates continue to rise, especially among specific populations. Current nonpharmacological treatments rely primarily upon cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which was introduced in the 1970s. Newer treatments have incorporated CBT "third wave" techniques, including mindfulness and acceptance techniques. Yoga practice is well suited to complement existing therapies and to address sleep problems in a more holistic way. Current theoretical and empirical approaches to treating insomnia are discussed, with an emphasis on the role of yoga in addressing precipitating and perpetuating factors in insomnia that have previously been largely overlooked.An estimated one-third of U.S. adults suffer from insomnia (Chen, Gelaye, & Williams, 2013; Mellinger, Balter, & Uhlenhuth, 1985; Ohayon, 2002), and the problem appears to be growing. While treatment for insomnia has helped to alleviate the problem for some (Irwin, Cole, & Nicassio, 2006; Morin et al., 2009), prevalence of insomnia is on the rise, especially among certain groups, including elderly and military populations (Morin, 2009; Mysliwiec et al., 2013). Rising rates of insomnia have been attributed to changes in lifestyle and environmental factors, including increased reliance on technology and decreased synchrony with natural wake-sleep rhythms (Brahinsky, 2013; Wallace-Guy et al., 2002; Yun, Bazar, Gerber, Lee, & Daniel, 2005).

25858658	Interest in yoga among fibromyalgia patients: an international internet survey.	Studies in circumscribed clinical settings have reported the adoption of yoga by many fibromyalgia (FM) patients. However, it is unclear from existing studies which types of yoga practices FM patients are typically engaging in and the extent to which they experience yoga as helpful or not. The purpose of this study was to survey FM patients in many different regions to inquire about their engagement in various yoga practices, the perceived benefits, and the obstacles to further practice. A 13-question Internet survey of persons self-identified as FM patients was conducted among subscribers to 2 electronic newsletters on the topic of FM. Respondents (N = 2543) replied from all 50 U.S. states and also from Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, and from more than two dozen other countries. On average, respondents were 57 years of age and 96% were female, with an average time since diagnosis of 13 years. Of these respondents, 79.8% had considered trying yoga and 57.8% had attended 1 yoga class. The respondents' classes typically focused almost exclusively on yoga poses, with minimal training in meditation, breathing techniques, or other practices. The most commonly cited benefits were reduced stiffness, relaxation, and better balance. The most frequently cited obstacles were concerns about the poses being too physically demanding and fear that the poses would cause too much pain. These findings confirm strong interest in yoga across a geographically diverse range of FM patients. However, concerns about yoga-induced pain and yoga poses being too difficult are common reasons that FM patients do not engage in yoga exercises. This study supports the need for yoga programs tailored for FM patients to include modification of poses to minimize aggravating movements and substantive training in meditation and other yoga-based coping methods to minimize pain-related fear.

25858656	A process evaluation of the art of yoga project mentor program for incarcerated teenage girls.	Returning to the community upon release from custody is a difficult process to navigate, and there are scant resources available to juvenile female offenders, in particular. Comprehensive wraparound aftercare and mentor services are a central component of successful community reentry, and the well-established unique characteristics of juvenile girls make it necessary to create programs catered specifically to them. The present study employed a case study design to describe and evaluate the Art of Yoga Project's Mentor Program. Eight girls and their mentors were followed for a period of 12 months after the girls' release from custody. Preliminary results from qualitative content analysis suggest that the program was valuable for the girls who participated.	Harris, Danielle Arlanda;Malone, Stephanie	2014
25858655	Implementing yoga therapy adapted for older veterans who are cancer survivors.	OBJECTIVES: This goal of this paper is to describe the reach, application, and effectiveness of an 8-week yoga therapy protocol with older cancer survivors within a Veterans Health Administration setting. METHODS: To document the reach of this intervention, recruitment efforts, attendance, and practice rates were tracked. To explore the application of the protocol to this population, physical therapy preassessment and observations by the yoga therapist were recorded to ascertain necessary pose modifications. Effectiveness was measured through pre- and post-course structured interviews, tracking self-reported symptoms of combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, and pain. RESULTS: Regarding reach, 15% of eligible veterans (n = 14) enrolled, participated in 3-16 classes (M+/-SD = 11.64+/-3.39), and practiced at home for 0-56 days (M+/-SD = 26.36+/-17.87). Participants were primarily Caucasian (n = 13), male (n = 13), ranged in age from 55 to 78 years (M+/-SD = 65.64+/-5.15), and had multiple medical problems. During application, substantial individualized modifications to the yoga therapy protocol were necessary. Effectiveness of the intervention was mixed. During post-course interviews, participants reported a variety of qualitative benefits. Notably, the majority of participants reported that breathing and relaxation techniques were the most useful to learn. Group comparisons of mean pre- and post-course scores on standardized measures showed no significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: A minority of older veterans express an interest in yoga, but those who do have high rates of class attendance and home practice. Careful physical pre-assessment and attentive therapists are required to undertake the adaptations required by participants with multiple comorbidities. The effectiveness of yoga in this setting requires additional study.

25858654	Self-reported morningness-eveningness related to positive affect-change associated with a single session of hatha yoga.	OBJECTIVES: To examine positive affect (PA) responses to a single hatha yoga session compared to a lecture control class and to investigate a potential association between selfreported morningness-eveningness and yoga - related PA change. METHOD: Participants (Mean age = 28.50 years) in the yoga group (n = 45) and control group (n = 25) completed the revised Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (rMEQ) before yoga and lecture (pre) and the Visual Analogue Mood Scale (VAMS) as a measure of PA before and after yoga and lecture (post). RESULTS: Pre-to-post PA change was greater in the yoga group compared to the control (p < 0.001). Analysis of the yoga group VAMS scores revealed a significant rMEQ type (morning, neither, evening) by time (pre to post) interaction (p = 0.03), with greater PA change in evening types compared to morning types (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The results show that a single hatha yoga session improves self-reported PA more than a lecture control and suggest a relationship between self-reported morningness-eveningness and PA responses to hatha yoga. The findings may help yoga practitioners, instructors, and researchers better understand the psychological benefits of yoga. Researchers should consider conducting long-term studies on the association between self-reported morningness- eveningness and affective responses to yoga practice.	Reed, Justy	2014
25858653	Flexibility of the elderly after one-year practice of yoga and calisthenics.	Flexibility training responses to distinct stretching techniques are not well defined, especially in the elderly. This study compared the flexibility of elderly individuals before and after having practiced hatha yoga and calisthenics for 1 year (52 weeks), at least 3 times/week. Sixty-six subjects (12 men) measured and assigned to 3 groups: control (n = 24, age = 67.7+/-6.9 years), hatha yoga (n = 22, age = 61.2+/-4.8 years), and calisthenics (n = 20, age = 69.0+/-5.8 years). The maximal range of passive motion of 13 movements in 7 joints was assessed by the Flexitest, comparing the range obtained with standard charts representing each arc of movement on a discontinuous and non-dimensional scale from 0 to 4. Results of individual movements were summed to define 4 indexes (ankle+knee, hip+trunk, wrist+elbow, and shoulder) and total flexibility (Flexindex). Results showed significant increases of total flexibility in the hatha yoga group (by 22.5 points) and the calisthenics group (by 5.8 points) (p < 0.01 for each) and a decrease in the control group (by 2.1 points) (p < 0.01) after one year of intervention. Between-group comparison showed that increases in the hatha yoga group were greater than in the calisthenics group for most flexibility indexes, particularly the overall flexibility (p <0.05). In conclusion, the practice of hatha yoga (i.e., slow/passive movements) was more effective in improving flexibility compared to calisthenics (i.e., fast/dynamic movements), but calisthenics was able to prevent flexibility losses observed in sedentary elderly subjects.

25858652	Acute and Cumulative Effects of Vinyasa Yoga on Affect and Stress among College Students Participating in an Eight-week Yoga Program: A Pilot Study.	BACKGROUND: College students are vulnerable to a critical period in developmental maturation, facing rigorous academic work and learning how to function independently. Western aerobic exercise (WAE), such as running and bicycling, has been shown to improve mood and relieve stress. However, college students often have low levels of physical activity. Yoga is an ancient physical and mental practice that may affect mood and stress. However, rigorous studies examining the psychological effects of yoga are rare in peerreviewed Western journals. The aim of this research was to establish preliminary evidence for the acute effects of Vinyasa yoga on affect and stress in young-adult college students. METHODS: Twenty healthy college students age 18 years and older were recruited to participate in this pilot study. Participants attended a Vinyasa yoga class at a local studio twice weekly for 8 weeks. Affect and stress were assessed before and after each yoga session. Measures included the Positive and Negative Affective Schedule (PANAS) and the Cohen Perceived Stress scale. RESULTS: Positive affect scores increased significantly (p < 0.05) for 14 of the 16 yoga sessions (mean increase = 23.2%). Negative affect decreased significantly from pre- to postyoga (p < 0.05) for 15 of the 16 sessions (mean decrease = 22%). Repeated measures ANOVAs examining pre-post composite scores across all 8 weeks showed significant changes in PANAS, but not stress scores. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that yoga practice is associated with acute improvements in affect in a young-adult college population. Future research is needed to examine the extent to which different types of yoga address the needs of different college sub-populations (e.g., eating disordered, overweight/obese, sedentary, and smokers).

25858651	Delivering Integrative Restoration-Yoga Nidra Meditation (iRest(R)) to Women with Sexual Trauma at a Veteran's Medical Center: A Pilot Study.	OBJECTIVE: This pilot study examines iRest, a form of guided mindfulness meditation, and its ability to reduce symptoms associated with sexual trauma, including military sexual trauma (MST), in a sample of women seeking psychotherapy services at a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center. METHODS: 90-minute sessions were held 19 times, twice a week for 10 weeks, except for the week with a holiday. Participants completed self-report measures Brief Symptom Inventory-18 (BSI), Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI), and the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Check List (PCL) pre- and post-treatment. Sixteen women were recruited: 15 enrolled, 5 dropped due to transportation issues, and 10 completed the protocol. RESULTS: Completers reported significant decreases in symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PCL, t (9) = 3.17, p < 0.01, d = 0.66), negative thoughts of self-blame (PTCI t (9) = 2.96, p < 0.05, d = 0.52), and depression (BSI, t (9) = 2.33, p < 0.05, d = 0.64). Participants also offered verbal reports of decreased body tension, improved quality of sleep, improved ability to handle intrusive thoughts, improved ability to manage stress, and an increased feeling of joy. Participants also enthusiastically endorsed the class and stated they would take it again and recommend it to others. CONCLUSIONS: This small pilot study showed promising results for delivering iRest to women with sexual trauma in a VA medical center. Further research is warranted.

25858650	A preliminary investigation of lumbar tactile acuity in yoga practitioners.	BACKGROUND: Tactile acuity in the back relates to voluntary lumbo-pelvic control and is lower in chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients. Two-point discrimination (TPD) thresholds are higher, indicating decreased tactile acuity in patients with CLBP. Yoga has been shown to help relieve CLBP. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the hypothesis that regular practitioners of yoga have increased tactile acuity (i.e., lower TPD thresholds) when compared to matched controls who regularly perform gym-based (resistance training or aerobic-type) exercise. METHOD: Tactile acuity in the low back was assessed using TPD in 16 long-term practitioners of yoga (5 Ashtanga, 5 Bikram, and 6 Iyengar practitioners) and 16 age- and gender-matched healthy controls who exercise (with weights and aerobic exercise). RESULTS: The yoga practitioners' TPD was lower than that of the exercisers, indicating greater tactile acuity in the low back. While there was no difference between the TPD of the practitioners of different yoga styles, the TPD of the Ashtanga yoga participants were significantly lower than those of the exercisers. The yogis whose main reasons to practice yoga were for "meditation or increased mindfulness" and for "well-being" showed a nonsignificant trend of higher tactile acuity than those who did yoga for "physical exercise." There was no association between TPD threshold and cumulative amount of yoga practice in terms of hours per week and years of experience. However, increased hours of exercise per week correlated with higher TPD. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that there may be a relationship between yoga practice and enhanced tactile acuity in the low back.	Flaherty, Mary;Connolly, Martin	2014
25858649	Measuring the effect of an eight-week adaptive yoga program on the physical and psychological status of individuals with Parkinson's disease. A pilot study.	Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects muscle tone, strength, flexibility, motor control, psychological outlook, cognition, and function. Exercise has been found to improve physical ability and psychological outlook, but the effect of yoga on individuals with PD has not been well researched. The purposes of this study were to identify outcome measures that were responsive to change in individuals with PD after an 8-week adaptive yoga program and to determine appropriate sample sizes for future studies. In a repeated measures design, 10 participants with a Hoehn and Yahr stage of 2 or 3 were tested prior to and after an 8-week control phase and again after they underwent an 8-week adaptive yoga program. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests revealed differences in time of measure that approached significance for the depression subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (p = 0.008) and the 30-Second Chair Stand (TSCS) (p = 0.013). The interaction between time of measure and gender approached significance for the Sit-and-Reach Test (SRT) (p = 0.08 and 0.03, right and left respectively), with male participants improving in sit-and-reach flexibility compared with female participants after intervention. The interaction between time of measure and age approached significance for the Single-Leg Balance test (SLB) (p = 0.007), with younger participants improving in SLB time after intervention. Power calculations found that a sample size ranging from 33 to 153 would be required to achieve significance at the 0.01 level in the various outcome measures in a future study of this design. The depression subscale of the HADS, the TSCS, the SLB, and the right and left SRT were the measures that changed following the yoga intervention and are recommended as outcome measures in future studies investigating the effectiveness of yoga for individuals with PD. This preliminary study supports further investigation of adaptive yoga using a randomized design and a larger sample size of individuals with PD.	Boulgarides, L K;Barakatt, E;Coleman-Salgado, B	2014

25857500	Sudarshan Kriya yoga improves quality of life in healthy people living with HIV (PLHIV): results from an open label randomized clinical trial.	BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Improving quality of life (QOL) of healthy people living with HIV (PLHIV) is critical needing home-based, long-term strategy. Sudarshan Kriya yoga (SKY) intervention is acknowledged for its positive impact on health. It is hypothesised that SKY would improve PLHIV's QOL, justifying an evaluation. METHODS: In this open label randomized controlled pilot trial, 61 adult PLHIV with CD4 count more than 400 cells/microl and Karnofsky scale score above 70 were enrolled. Those with cardiac disease, jaundice, tuberculosis, or on antiretroviral therapy/yoga intervention were excluded. All were given standard care, randomized to SKY intervention (31: I-SKY) and only standard of care in control (30: O-SOC) arms. The I-SKY participants were trained for six days to prepare for daily practice of SKY at home for 30 min. A validated 31-item WHOQOL-HIVBREF questionnaire was used to document effect in both arms from baseline to three visits at 4 wk interval. RESULTS: Baseline QOL scores, hypertension and CD4 count were similar in both arms. An overall 6 per cent improvement of QOL scores was observed in I-SKY group as compared to O-SOC group, after controlling for baseline variables like age, gender, education and occupation ( p =0.016); 12 per cent for physical ( p =0.004), 11 per cent psychological (p =0.023) and 9 per cent level of independence (p =0.001) domains. Improvement in I-SKY observed at post-training and in the SKY adherence group showed increase in these two domains. CONCLUSIONS: A significant improvement in QOL scores was observed for the three health related QOL domains in SKY intervention arm. This low cost strategy improved physical and psychological state of PLHIV calling for upscaling with effective monitoring for sustainability of quality of life.

25853030	Effects of six months of Yoga on inflammatory serum markers prognostic of recurrence risk in breast cancer survivors.	Yoga-based exercise has proven to be beneficial for practitioners, including cancer survivors. This study reports on the effect on inflammatory biological markers for 20 breast cancer survivors who participated in a six-month yoga-based (YE) exercise program. Results are compared to a comprehensive exercise (CE) program group and a comparison (C) exercise group who chose their own exercises. "Pre" and "post" assessments included measures of anthropometrics, cardiorespiratory capacity, and inflammatory markers interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Descriptive statistics, effect size (d), and dependent sample 't' tests for all outcome measures were calculated for the YE group. Significant improvements were seen in decreased % body fat, (-3.00%, d = -0.44, p = <.001) but not in cardiorespiratory capacity or in inflammatory serum markers. To compare YE outcomes with the other two groups, a one-way analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) was used, controlling for age, BMI, cardiorespiratory capacity and serum marker baseline values. We found no differences between groups. Moreover, we did not see significant changes in any inflammatory marker for any group. Our results support the effectiveness of yoga-based exercise modified for breast cancer survivors for improving body composition. Larger studies are needed to determine if there are significant changes in inflammatory serum markers as a result of specific exercise modalities.

25852521	Greater widespread functional connectivity of the caudate in older adults who practice kripalu yoga and vipassana meditation than in controls.	There has been a growing interest in understanding how contemplative practices affect brain functional organization. However, most studies have restricted their exploration to predefined networks. Furthermore, scientific comparisons of different contemplative traditions are largely lacking. Here we explored differences in whole brain resting state functional connectivity between experienced yoga practitioners, experienced meditators, and matched controls. Analyses were repeated in an independent sample of experienced meditators and matched controls. Analyses utilizing Network-Based Statistics (Zalesky et al., 2010) revealed difference components for yoga practitioners > controls and meditators > controls in which the right caudate was a central node. Follow up analyses revealed that yoga practitioners and meditators had significantly greater degree centrality in the caudate than controls. This greater degree centrality was not driven by single connections but by greater connectivity between the caudate and numerous brain regions. Findings of greater caudate connectivity in meditators than in controls was replicated in an independent dataset. These findings suggest that yoga and meditation practitioners have stronger functional connectivity within basal ganglia cortico-thalamic feedback loops than non-practitioners. Although we could not provide evidence for its mechanistic role, this greater connectivity might be related to the often reported effects of meditation and yoga on behavioral flexibility, mental health, and well-being.

25844090	A large-scale survey of adverse events experienced in yoga classes.	BACKGROUND: Yoga is a representative mind-body therapy of complementary and alternative medicine. In Japan, yoga is practiced widely to promote health, but yoga-associated adverse events have also been reported. To date, the frequencies and characteristics of yoga-related adverse events have not been elucidated. This study was conducted to elucidate the frequencies and characteristics of adverse events of yoga performed in classes and the risk factors of such events. METHODS: The subjects were 2508 people taking yoga classes and 271 yoga therapists conducting the classes. A survey for yoga class attendees was performed on adverse events that occurred during a yoga class on the survey day. A survey for yoga therapists was performed on adverse events that the therapists had observed in their students to date. Adverse events were defined as "undesirable symptoms or responses that occurred during a yoga class". RESULTS: Among 2508 yoga class attendees, 1343 (53.5%) had chronic diseases and 1063 (42.3%) were receiving medication at hospitals. There were 687 class attendees (27.8%) who reported some type of undesirable symptoms after taking a yoga class. Musculoskeletal symptoms such as myalgia were the most common symptoms, involving 297 cases, followed by neurological symptoms and respiratory symptoms. Most adverse events (63.8%) were mild and did not interfere with class participation. The risk factors for adverse events were examined, and the odds ratios for adverse events were significantly higher in attendees with chronic disease, poor physical condition on the survey day, or a feeling that the class was physically and mentally stressful. In particular, the occurrence of severe adverse events that interfered with subsequent yoga practice was high among elderly participants (70 years or older) and those with chronic musculoskeletal diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this large-scale survey demonstrated that approximately 30% of yoga class attendees had experienced some type of adverse event. Although the majority had mild symptoms, the survey results indicated that attendees with chronic diseases were more likely to experience adverse events associated with their disease. Therefore, special attention is necessary when yoga is introduced to patients with stress-related, chronic diseases.	Matsushita, Tomoko;Oka, Takakazu	2015
25838730	Support system for mental health professionals.	This paper talks of support systems for mental health professionals wherein the Bombay Psychiatric Society (BPS) should devote some meetings exclusively to problems pertaining to the profession, e.g., long and odd working hours leading to potentially hazardous practice schedules, unhealthy competitive attitudes and culture. A crash course in self-defence against potentially psychotic patients and drug addicts is advocated as also awareness of the potential hazards in dealing with the litigious paranoid patients, erotomaniacs and some of the difficult hysterical patients. Potential medicolegal problems arise in treating an uncooperative patient without his knowledge and consent on an outpatient department basis, admitting such an uncooperative patient to a nursing home or a hospital, administering electroconvulsive therapies, maintaining detailed clinical records of patients, and legal issues involving smaller psychiatric private nursing homes. This paper stresses on the use of Yoga as a recognised psycho-physiological therapy. Furthermore, it suggests on the need for BPS, as a professional body, to have a cell to guide and help aspiring young professionals in setting up private practice. It points out the need to evolve some concrete programmes that in the long run should help alleviate stresses and strains and promote positive comprehensive health amongst mental health professionals.

25810995	Correlates of overweight and obesity among urban adolescents in bihar, India.	BACKGROUND: For better perception of adolescent overweight and obesity as a global public health problem, systematic collection of baseline data is urgently needed in India. OBJECTIVE: A community-based study was undertaken for better perception of the prevalence and correlates of obesity in an adolescent urban community in Katihar, Bihar. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among urban adolescents in the eastern part of India to find out prevalence of overweight and obesity and sociodemographic correlates by interview technique followed by clinical examination with ethical consideration. RESULTS: Out of 400 adolescent study participants, 21% were overweight or obese. The study showed that there was a significant association between less consumption of vegetable foods, fruits, meals cooked outside the home, alcohol consumption, yoga practice, socioeconomic status, and the occurrence of overweight/obesity in the adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: We attempted to find out the prevalence and risk correlates of overweight and obesity among adolescents and found it quite alarming compared to developed countries. The urban underserved population in India has difficulty to access quality healthcare and not conscious enough to seek healthcare until critically ill. Community-based studies are required to highlight the problem of obesity among urban adolescents by a comprehensive approach.	Ghosh, Ayan;Sarkar, Deblina;Pal, Ranabir;Mukherjee, Bijoy	2015 Jan-Mar
25810653	Survey on utility of yoga as an alternative therapy for occupational hazards among dental practioners.	BACKGROUND: The therapeutic potential of yoga are often considered complementary to various forms of medical practice. Very few studies have evaluated the effects of yoga in the treatment of occupational hazards among dentists. Hence, this cross-sectional study was designed to evaluate the adoption of yoga techinques as an alternative therapy in treatment of physical and psychological occupational hazards among dental general practitioners in Chennai, India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A validated closed-ended questionnaire was circulated to 500 dental general practitioners in Chennai, India and we received 394 completed questionnaires. The questionnaire documented demographic data, occupational hazards and the type of treatment taken for the hazards. RESULTS: Musculoskeletal pain with stress (47%) was the most common occupational hazard reported, followed by only stress (27.4%), and only musculoskeletal pain (25.6%). Only 9.6% of practitioners adopted yoga as an alternative treatment for these occupational hazards. Interestingly, majority (46.4%) of them did exercise, gym, massage, walking and heard music. Surprisingly, 43.9% did not take any measures to treat these occupational hazards. However 53.3% of the dentists who did not consider yoga as an alternative therapy, stated lack of time as a reason for not practicing yoga while 17.6% of them don't believe yoga as a therapy. CONCLUSION: Despite musculoskeletal pain and stress being the most common occupational hazard prevalent among dentists, over 50% of the subjects surveyed didn't seek any measure to treat these occupational hazards and only 10% of them practiced yoga as the alternative therapy.

25796668	[Advances in research of complementary and integrative medicine: a review of recent publications in some of the leading medical journals].	This article assesses the evidence for effectiveness, adverse effects and cost-effectiveness of complementary therapies, as reflected in publications in high impact factor medical journals during the years 2012-2014. The search detected 13 randomized controlled studies (RCTs) and 14 meta-analyses, which collectively assessed results of 191 RCTs involving the participation of several thousand patients. Pain was the major focus of acupuncture research in both clinical and fMRI studies, which demonstrated that the effect of acupuncture is beyond the placebo effect. In addition, RCTs supported the use of acupuncture as an adjunctive therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and in moderate to severe depression. A promising trend was reported for the ameliorating effect of acupuncture in gout. Spinal manipulations may be helpful in cervical pain and yoga may be a useful treatment option for chronic neck pain, chronic low back pain and for pain-related disability. Beneficial effects of adding hypnosis and massage therapy to the treatment of fibromyalgia patients were also documented. Tai-chi may reduce balance impairment in mild-to-moderate Parkinson's disease and improve symptoms in patients with osteoarthritis. Products containing cranberry are associated with protective effects in some subgroups of patients with recurrent urinary tract infections. Chinese herbs may assist in glycemic control of diabetes patients and improve survival rate of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Some of the complementary therapies were found to be cost-effective. Physicians should be aware of the possible adverse effects of these treatments and of possible drug-herb interactions. Further larger scale trials are justified.	Gamus, Dorit	2015 Jan
25773322	Being present at school: implementing mindfulness in schools.	Developmentally sensitive efforts to help students learn, practice, and regularly use mindfulness tactics easily and readily in and beyond the classroom are important to help them manage future stresses. Mindfulness emphasizes consciously focusing the mind in the present moment, purposefully, without judgment or attachment. Meditation extends this to setting aside time and places to practice mindfulness, and additionally, yoga includes physical postures and breathing techniques that enhance mindfulness and meditation. Several mindfulness programs and techniques have been applied in schools, with positive benefits reported.

25759746	Cognitive behavior evaluation based on physiological parameters among young healthy subjects with yoga as intervention.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of yoga practice on cognitive skills, autonomic nervous system, and heart rate variability by analyzing physiological parameters. METHODS: The study was conducted on 30 normal young healthy engineering students. They were randomly selected into two groups: yoga group and control group. The yoga group practiced yoga one and half hour per day for six days in a week, for a period of five months. RESULTS: The yoga practising group showed increased alpha, beta, and delta EEG band powers and significant reduction in theta and gamma band powers. The increased alpha and beta power can represent enhanced cognitive functions such as memory and concentration, and that of delta signifies synchronization of brain activity. The heart rate index theta/alpha decreased, neural activity beta/theta increased, attention resource index beta/(alpha + theta) increased, executive load index (delta + theta)/alpha decreased, and the ratio (delta + theta)/(alpha + beta) decreased. The yoga practice group showed improvement in heart rate variability, increased SDNN/RMSSD, and reduction in LF/HF ratio. CONCLUSION: Yoga practising group showed significant improvement in various cognitive functions, such as performance enhancement, neural activity, attention, and executive function. It also resulted in increase in the heart rate variability, parasympathetic nervous system activity, and balanced autonomic nervous system reactivity.	Nagendra, H;Kumar, Vinod;Mukherjee, S	2015
25752248	[The relationship between Yoga Immersion, psychological well-being and psychiatric symptoms].	BACKGROUND: In recent years positive effects of Yoga (as a kind of spiritual exercise) in regards to subjective well-being and physical health can be found as well documented in the literature. METHOD: Based on a construct-psychological approach a newly developed scale for the assessment of Yoga involvement (immersion) was validated on a sample of 233 non-clinical subjects (210 females) by means of socio-demographic and well established psychometric parameters of psychological well-being and psychiatric symptoms. Furthermore, the group of yoga practitioners was compared with a control group consisting of 93 gymnastics practitioners (83 women) with respect to these parameters. RESULTS: The amount of Yoga Immersion (YI) can be reliably assessed by means of the one-dimensional YI-scale (10 items) and shows to be strongly correlated with Mindfulness (r = .56; p < .01), Inner Correspondence (r = .61; p < .01) and Religious/Spiritual Well-being (r = .68; p < .01). Furthermore highly yoga-immersive practitioners exhibited a significant higher amount of psychological well-being (p < .01) compared to marginally/moderately yoga-immersive and gymnastics practitioners. The Yoga-group also showed a lower amount of psychiatric symptoms (e.g. depression; p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: The globally postulated positive relationship between Yoga-practicing and mental health could be confirmed; thereby the impact of YI can be assumed as central. Further randomized controlled trial research focusing on the health/disease-related aspects of YI might be conducted especially in clinical groups.

25751910	[Relaxation to defuse acting out for dangerous schizophrenics].	Relaxation is often considered as a contraindication in the management of schizophrenics. An experiment carried out with dangerous schizophrenics at the unit for dangerous patients at Cadillac general hospital revealed that, on the contrary, such an opinion is not necessarily valid in all cases. Indeed, for many of these patients, relaxation can have positive effects on their clinical state. As with its other indications, relaxation must be practised by clinicians who have an in-depth knowledge of techniques to use and of mental disorders treated in that way.

25749602	Clinical practice guidelines on the use of integrative therapies as supportive care in patients treated for breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: The majority of breast cancer patients use complementary and/or integrative therapies during and beyond cancer treatment to manage symptoms, prevent toxicities, and improve quality of life. Practice guidelines are needed to inform clinicians and patients about safe and effective therapies. METHODS: Following the Institute of Medicine's guideline development process, a systematic review identified randomized controlled trials testing the use of integrative therapies for supportive care in patients receiving breast cancer treatment. Trials were included if the majority of participants had breast cancer and/or breast cancer patient results were reported separately, and outcomes were clinically relevant. Recommendations were organized by outcome and graded based upon a modified version of the US Preventive Services Task Force grading system. RESULTS: The search (January 1, 1990-December 31, 2013) identified 4900 articles, of which 203 were eligible for analysis. Meditation, yoga, and relaxation with imagery are recommended for routine use for common conditions, including anxiety and mood disorders (Grade A). Stress management, yoga, massage, music therapy, energy conservation, and meditation are recommended for stress reduction, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and quality of life (Grade B). Many interventions (n = 32) had weaker evidence of benefit (Grade C). Some interventions (n = 7) were deemed unlikely to provide any benefit (Grade D). Notably, only one intervention, acetyl-l-carnitine for the prevention of taxane-induced neuropathy, was identified as likely harmful (Grade H) as it was found to increase neuropathy. The majority of intervention/modality combinations (n = 138) did not have sufficient evidence to form specific recommendations (Grade I). CONCLUSIONS: Specific integrative therapies can be recommended as evidence-based supportive care options during breast cancer treatment. Most integrative therapies require further investigation via well-designed controlled trials with meaningful outcomes.

25749599	Associations between healthy lifestyle behaviors and complementary and alternative medicine use: integrated wellness.	BACKGROUND: Conventional medicine, lifestyle modification, and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) are potential strategies to decrease the risk of late effects in pediatric cancer survivors. This study aimed to compare the characteristics and usage patterns of CAM and lifestyle therapies among survivors of childhood cancer. METHODS: We report the results of a cross sectional survey comparing usage patterns of CAM and lifestyle therapies among childhood cancer survivors. CAM therapies were defined by NCCAM classifications and lifestyle therapies were defined as dietary changes, conventional supplements with dietary reference intake values, and exercise. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-five (95%) patients approached in person and 45 (34%) patients approached by mail consented to participate. Sixty-eight used at least one lifestyle therapy and 58% used at least one CAM therapy. CAM users had 4.7 times the odds of using lifestyle therapies than non-CAM users (P < .0001); the odds of using dietary change and conventional supplements was greater in CAM users than non-CAM users (odds ratio [OR] = 3.55, P < .0001 and OR = 4.80, P < .0001 respectively). Use of the top three CAM therapies was associated with overall lifestyle therapy use (OR = 12.52 and P < .0001, OR = 7.071 and P = .0004, and OR = 2.925 and P = .0089 for juicing, yoga/movement, and touch therapies, respectively). Lifestyle therapies and CAM had similar perceived efficacy (92%-90%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This data reports a strong association between CAM and lifestyle therapies and may identify a population with commitment to general wellness. Use of one therapy may promote use of other therapies and this potential synergistic relationship can be targeted in future interventions.

25713658	Do 12-week yoga program influence respiratory function of elderly women?	Aging produces several respiratory limitations and reduces tolerance to physical efforts, sometimes leading to pulmonary diseases in the elderly. The literature draws attention to the possible benefits of Yoga practice among the elderly, presenting evidence for significant improvements in quality of life. It was hypothesized that yoga practice can improve respiratory function in the elderly. The effects of a yoga program on pulmonary volumes and respiratory muscle strength were verified in 36 elderly women divided into a yoga group [YG] (63.1 +/- 13.3 years of age) and a control group (61.0 +/- 6.9 years of age). Maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure (MIP and MEP) were assessed by a manovacuometer and tidal volume (VT), vital capacity (VC) and minute ventilation (VE) were measured by a ventilometer. The program comprised 65 min sessions, 3 times/week during 12 weeks. The heart rate and respiratory rate decreased significantly in the YG (76-39 +/- 8-03 vs. 74-61+/-10.26 bpm and 18.61 +/- 3.15 vs. 16.72 +/- 3.12 resp/min, respectively). In the YG, VT and VE increased significantly (0.55 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.64 +/- 0.2 ml and 9.19 +/- 2.39 vs. 10.05 +/- 2.11 ml, respectively), as well as VC (1.48 +/- 0.45 vs. 2.03 +/- 0.72 ml). Improvements were also found in MIP and MEP in the YG (62.17 +/- 14.77 vs. 73.06 +/- 20.16 cmH2O and 80.56 +/- 23.94 vs. 86.39 +/- 20.16 cmH2O, respectively). It was concluded that a 12-week yoga program significantly improves pulmonary function of aged women.

25709511	Influences of a yoga intervention on the postural skills of the Italian short track speed skating team.	INTRODUCTION: In preparation for a short track speed skating season, eight men and seven women were given yoga sessions during an 8-week high volume training cycle. The sessions were planned according to the postural aspects specific to short track speed skating technical requirements. Three specific goals were selected for the intervention: 1) to observe whether the practice of yoga as postural training could improve the efficiency and the athlete's repertoire along the muscular synergies solicited in the short track speed skating specific technique; 2) to enhance and diversify the motor time-on-task of athletes without changing the prescription of other training stimulus; and 3) to lower the risk of injury during periods with high volumes of training. METHODS: A total of 36 sessions of yoga were given. Three postural tests were administered before and after the intervention with 14 angles analyzed. Non-parametric Wilcoxon test was used to compare angles' variations. RESULTS: The 36 yoga sessions totalized 986 minutes of motor time-on-task, registering a proportion of 30% of the global motor time-on-task of the training cycle. Improvements were found in eleven of the 14 angles measured when comparing pre- and post-postural tests (P-value from 0.01 to 0.005). During the 8 weeks, excepting traumatic injuries due to short track speed skating accidents, no skaters suffered injuries linked to the high volume of training. Following the intervention, coaches noticed, following their on-ice feedbacks, an adjustment in the efficiency of the skating technique, in particular regarding hip dissociation. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that yoga could be inserted into out-of-season training cycles, even in a high volume training cycle. Planned with the decision training tools, it allows athletes to diversify their motor time-on-task by integrating a new functional range of generic movements with the solicitation of neuromuscular synergies related to the specificity of their sport.

25697379	The effects of yoga on the quality of life and depression in elderly breast cancer patients.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of yoga on the quality of life in patients with cancer. DESIGN: Twenty patients (10 were in yoga program, 10 were in exercise group) between 65 and 70 years of age under going treatment for cancer were included in the study. Physical characteristics of the patients were recorded and general physiotherapy assessments performed. Eight sessions of a classical yoga program including warming and breathing exercises, asanas, relaxation in supine position, and meditation and 8 sessions of classical exercise program were applied to participants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Before and after yoga and exercise program, quality of life assessments for the patients were conducted using the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). Patients' depression levels were assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory. Their level of pain, fatigue and sleep quality was evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS). RESULTS: It was found that all patients' quality of life scores after the yoga and exercise program were better than scores obtained before the yoga and exercise program (p < 0.05). When the post treatment data of the groups were compared in terms of NHP and subcategories, ER, SI, S, PA and the total scores of NHP were found significantly different in favor of Group I (p < 0.05). However EL and P scores of the NHP were not different between the groups (p > 0.05). When the groups were compared in terms of depression, pain, fatigue, and sleep quality, statistically significant differences were found in all parameters between pre and post treatment values for both groups (p < 0.05). When the post-treatment values of the groups were compared, fatigue and sleep quality were found statistically different between the groups in favor of Group I (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that yoga is valuable in helping to diminish depression, pain, fatigue and helps cancer patients to perform daily and routine activities, and increases the quality of life in elderly patients with breast cancer.

25694999	Comparison of regular aerobic and yoga on the quality of life in patients with multiple sclerosis.	BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by fatigue, motor weakness, and spasticity, to name a few. MS symptoms may lead to physical inactivity associated with the development of secondary diseases. This study was to investigate the effect of regular aerobic and yoga on the quality of life of patients with MS. METHODS: The present quasi-experimental study was conducted on 90 patients with chronic MS chosen randomly and divided into two test and one control groups. Data were analyzed using SPSS software (version 11.5) through paired t-test, ANOVA, and Tukey's post hoc. RESULTS: There were no significant differences among the scores of quality of life in the three groups prior to investigation. Although they were significant after intervention. The mean score of yoga group was higher than that of aerobic group, and aerobic group showed a higher mean score compared with the control. CONCLUSION: Yoga and aerobic exercises may improve quality of life in patients with MS. It is highly recommended that the governor along with MS societies and other organizations servicing and supporting patients start to develop sport-regulated programs to help improve quality of life for these patients.

25694850	Preference and Expectation for Treatment Assignment in a Randomized Controlled Trial of Once- vs Twice-weekly Yoga for Chronic Low Back Pain.	BACKGROUND: In studies involving nonpharmacological complementary and alternative medicine interventions, participant blinding is very difficult. Participant expectations may affect perceived benefit of therapy. In studies of yoga as treatment for chronic low back pain, little is known about the relationship between patient expectations and preferences on outcomes. This study was designed to identify baseline predictors of preference and to determine if expectations and preferences for different doses of yoga affect back-related function and low back pain intensity. METHODS: This was a secondary data analysis of a 12-week randomized controlled trial comparing once-weekly vs twice-weekly yoga for treatment of chronic low back pain in 93 adults from a predominantly low-income minority population. At baseline, participants were asked about back function, back pain, treatment expectations, and treatment preferences. We created a variable "concordance" to describe the matching of participant preference to randomized treatment. Our outcome variables were change in back function and pain intensity after 12 weeks of yoga instruction. We performed logistic regression to identify predictors of preference for once- or twice-weekly yoga instruction. We created linear regression models to identify independent associations between expectations, preference, concordance, and outcomes. RESULTS: Worse back function at baseline was associated with 20% higher odds of preferring twice-weekly yoga (OR 1.2, CI 1.1, 1.3). Individuals with higher expectation scores for twice-weekly yoga had 90% higher odds of preferring twice-weekly vs once-weekly yoga (OR 1.9, CI 1.3, 2.7). Individuals with higher expectation scores for once-weekly yoga had 40% less odds of preferring twice-weekly yoga (OR 0.6, CI 0.5, 0.9). After controlling for baseline characteristics, we found no statistically significant relationship between treatment outcomes, preference, expectation scores, or concordance. CONCLUSION: In a population of predominantly low-income minority participants with chronic low back pain, worse back function was associated with preference for more frequent yoga classes. Those who preferred more yoga classes had higher expectations for those classes. Twelve-week change in back pain intensity and back function were not affected by dosing preference, expectation score, or concordance. More research is needed to better measure and quantify preference, expectations, and their relationship to outcomes in yoga research.

25694849	Implementation of an integrative coping and resiliency program for nurses.	PURPOSE: To improve resiliency and reduce burnout in nurses through implementation of the Healing Pathways program (University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore). Aims of this study include assessment of feasibility and acceptability and to explore changes in stress, coping, burnout, and mindfulness. DESIGN: A single-group, pre-, posttest design of an 8-week program in which participants attended weekly sessions that included Reiki, yoga, and meditation. Sample included 8 nurses with 1 advanced practice nurse, all female, ages ranging from 22 to 49 years, experience levels ranging from <1 year to 26 years. METHODS: Participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale, Coping Self-Efficacy Scale, Maslach Burnout Inventory, and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale before intervention, at last session, and 1 month after last session. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and qualitative narrative inquiry. FINDINGS: Improvements were noted in perceived stress, coping, burnout exhaustion subscale, and mindfulness. CONCLUSION: Healing Pathways was effective at reducing stress and improving coping and mindfulness in nurses. IMPLICATIONS: Nurses who invest time in self-care techniques including Reiki, yoga, and meditation improve their overall wellbeing and may provide higher-quality patient care. Implementation of an 8-week program in integrative self-care is feasible and important for the health of nurses.	Deible, Stephanie;Fioravanti, Marie;Tarantino, Bonnie;Cohen, Susan	2015 Jan
25688304	Effects of yoga on utero-fetal-placental circulation in high-risk pregnancy: a randomized controlled trial.	Introduction. Impaired placentation and inadequate trophoblast invasion have been associated with the etiology of many pregnancy complications and have been correlated with the first trimester uterine artery resistance. Previous studies have shown the benefits of yoga in improving pregnancy outcomes and those of yogic visualization in revitalizing the human tissues. Methods. 59 high-risk pregnant women were randomized into yoga (n = 27) and control (n = 32) groups. The yoga group received standard care plus yoga sessions (1 hour/day, 3 times/week), from 12th to 28th week of gestation. The control group received standard care plus conventional antenatal exercises (walking). Measurements were assessed at 12th, 20th, and 28th weeks of gestation. Results. RM-ANOVA showed significantly higher values in the yoga group (28th week) for biparietal diameter (P = 0.001), head circumference (P = 0.002), femur length (P = 0.005), and estimated fetal weight (P = 0.019). The resistance index in the right uterine artery (P = 0.01), umbilical artery (P = 0.011), and fetal middle cerebral artery (P = 0.048) showed significantly lower impedance in the yoga group. Conclusion. The results of this first randomized study of yoga in high-risk pregnancy suggest that guided yogic practices and visualization can improve the intrauterine fetal growth and the utero-fetal-placental circulation.

25660663	Nasal cycle dominance and hallucinations in an adult schizophrenic female.	Nasal dominance, at the onset of hallucinations, was studied as a marker of both the lateralized ultradian rhythm of the autonomic nervous system and the tightly coupled ultradian rhythm of alternating cerebral hemispheric dominance in a single case study of a schizophrenic female. Over 1086 days, 145 hallucination episodes occurred with left nostril dominance significantly greater than the right nostril dominant phase of the nasal cycle. A right nostril breathing exercise, that primarily stimulates the left hemisphere, reduces symptoms more quickly for hallucinations.	Shannahoff-Khalsa, David;Golshan, Shahrokh	2015 Mar 30
25658772	Acute effects of walking, cycling, and yoga exercise on cognition in persons with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis without impaired cognitive processing speed.	INTRODUCTION: Cognitive impairment is a highly prevalent, disabling, and poorly managed consequence of multiple sclerosis (MS). Exercise training represents a promising approach for managing cognitive impairment in this population. However, there is limited evidence supporting an optimal exercise stimulus for improving cognition in MS. The current study compared the acute effects of moderate-intensity treadmill walking, moderate-intensity cycle ergometry, and guided yoga with those of quiet rest on executive control in 24 persons with relapsing-remitting MS without impaired cognitive processing speed using a within-subjects, repeated measures design. METHOD: Participants completed four experimental conditions that consisted of 20 minutes of moderate-intensity treadmill walking exercise, moderate-intensity cycle ergometer exercise, guided yoga, and quiet rest in a randomized, counterbalanced order. Participants underwent a modified-flanker task as a measure of executive control immediately prior to and following each condition. RESULTS: Repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) indicated general pre-to-post improvements in reaction time, but not accuracy, on the modified-flanker task for all three exercise modalities compared with quiet rest. However, there were additional, selective pre-to-post reductions in the cost of interfering stimuli on reaction time on the modified-flanker task for treadmill walking, F(1, 23) = 4.67, p = .04, eta(p)2 = .17, but not cycle ergometry, F(1, 23) = 0.12, p = .73, eta(p)2 < .01, or guided yoga, F(1, 23) = 0.73, p = .40, eta(p)2 = .03, compared with quiet rest. CONCLUSIONS: The present results support treadmill walking as the modality of exercise that might exert the largest beneficial effects on executive control in persons with relapsing-remitting MS without impaired cognitive processing speed. This represents an exciting starting point for delineating the appropriate exercise stimulus (i.e., modality and intensity) for inclusion in a subsequent longitudinal exercise training intervention for improving cognitive performance in this population.

25657461	Efficacy of short-term Yoga therapy program on quality of life in patients with psychosomatic ailments.	OBJECTIVE: The aim was to study the effect of short-term Yoga therapy program on quality of life in patients suffering from psychosomatic ailments. METHODS: Sample size and Study period: All the subjects coming to SVYASA AROGYADHAMA in month of July 2011 for Yoga therapy for various psychosomatic ailments and were free of any primary psychiatric illness and volunteering to participate were enrolled in the study after taking informed consent. Their physical condition was healthy enough to practice Yoga as judged clinically. All subjects (n = 94) who were enrolled in the study underwent Integrated Approach to Yoga Therapy, which included Asanas, Pranayamas, meditation, Kriyas and lectures on practice of Yoga and derived special techniques in their respective sections. The quality of life was assessed by SF-12 questionnaire and thereby calculating Physical and Mental Composite Scores (PCS and MCS) before and after 1 week of Yoga therapy. Data thus obtained was analyzed using paired t-test. RESULTS: A significant improvement (P < 0.001) was seen in the study group in both PCS (from mean +/- SD of 37.50 +/- 9.58 to 43.7 +/- 8.73) and MCS (from 45.87 +/- 9.57 to 53.35 +/- 7.9.) with minor variations in patients of various departments. CONCLUSION: A short-term Yoga therapy program leads to a remarkable improvement in the quality of life of the subjects and can contribute favorably in the management of psychosomatic disorders.

25653936	Effect of pranayama and suryanamaskar on pulmonary functions in medical students.	BACKGROUND: Pranayama improved lung functions in numerous studies. Yoga involve isometric contraction and improves skeletal muscle strength. Yoga training improves the strength of expiratory as well as inspiratory muscles. AIM: The present study is planned to find the effect of pranayama on pulmonary functions in medical students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is conducted on 50 students doing lst year M.B.B.S. Consent form has been taken from them. They have been given yoga training 30 min daily for 2 mnth under the guidance of a trained yoga instructor. Vital capacity (VC), Tidal volume (TV), Expiratory Reserve volume (ERV), Breath holding time (BHT), 40 mm endurance, Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) are measured before & after yoga training. RESULTS: VC has increased from 2972 +/- 213.151 to 3372 +/- 528.7722. TV has increased from 496 +/- 84.06347 to 588 +/- 150.8863. ERV also shows increase in values from 888 +/- 183.303 to 1096 +/- 386.7385. BHT also shows increase in values from 33 +/- 5.773503 to 58.6 +/- 12.78019. 40 mm endurance also shows increase in values from 30.8 +/- 5.139715 to 53.52 +/- 15.68736. PEFR also shows increase in value from 388.8 +/- 15.36229 to 425.2 +/- 38.74274. CONCLUSION: There is a statistically significant increase in all the above mentioned pulmonary functions following yoga training. Yoga practice can be advocated to improve pulmonary functions in healthy individuals and hence to prevent respiratory diseases in future.

25642684	Anthropometric and physiologic profiles of female professional yoga practitioners and energy expenditure during asanas execution.	AIM: The present study aimed to: 1) define the anthropometric and physiological profiles of female professional yoga practitioner compared to that of other athletes; 2) evaluate the energy expenditure (EE) during a yoga session. METHODS: The percentage fat mass (FM%) and fat free mass (FFM%), the maximal aerobic power (VO2max), the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of knee extensor muscles and the maximal anaerobic alactacid power (Wmax) were assessed in a group of yoga practitioners (Yo), long distance runners (LDR), sprinters (Spr), karate practitioners (Ka) and sedentary control subjects (Con). EE was evaluated in Yo during a yoga session (execution of a sequence of six yoga postures, called asanas). RESULTS: FM% was significantly higher in Con (24.2+/-2.6%) than in other groups (18+/-1.9%, pooled data, P<0.05). FFM% did not differ among groups. VO2max was higher in LDR (55.6+/-1.8 mL min-1 kg-1) compared to other groups (41.7+/-3 mL min-1 kg-1, pooled data, P<0.05). MVC and Wmax were higher in Yo, Spr and Ka than in LDR and Con (P<0.05). In Yo, EE increased in comparison to baseline, during Sirasana execution only (+59%, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that chronic yoga practice is associated with 1) values of FM%, FFM%, MVC and Wmax similar to those induced by sports requiring high degree of force and power of lower limb muscles, with maximal aerobic performance similar to control subjects; 2) low EE during most asanas execution.

25642038	Effect of yoga training on one leg standing and functional reach tests in obese individuals with poor postural control.	[Purpose] The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of yoga training on static and dynamic standing balance in obese individuals with poor standing balance. [Subjects and Methods] Sixteen obese volunteers were randomly assigned into yoga and control groups. The yoga training program was performed for 45 minutes per day, 3 times per week, for 4 weeks. Static and dynamic balance were assessed in volunteers with one leg standing and functional reach tests. Outcome measures were tested before training and after a single week of training. Two-way repeated measure analysis of variance with Tukey's honestly significant difference post hoc statistics was used to analyze the data. [Results] Obese individuals showed significantly increased static standing balance in the yoga training group, but there was no significant improvement of static or dynamic standing balance in the control group after 4 weeks. In the yoga group, significant increases in static standing balance was found after the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th weeks. Compared with the control group, static standing balance in the yoga group was significantly different after the 2nd week, and dynamic standing balance was significantly different after the 4th week. [Conclusion] Yoga training would be beneficial for improving standing balance in obese individuals with poor standing balance.

25638842	High-density lipoprotein cholesterol increases following a short-term yoga-based lifestyle intervention: a non-pharmacological modulation.	OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to assess the effect of a brief but comprehensive yoga-based lifestyle intervention on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c). METHODS: This prospective interventional study was performed at the Integral Health Clinic (IHC), an outpatient facility at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, a tertiary health care centre, conducting yoga-based lifestyle intervention programmes for prevention and management of chronic diseases. The study included apparently healthy normal weight, overweight and obese subjects who underwent a pretested 10-day yoga-based programme including asanas (postures), pranayama (breathing exercises), meditation, group discussions, lectures and individualized advice on stress management and healthy diet. The primary outcome measure was change in serum HDL-c at day 10 versus day 0. RESULTS: 238 participants (147 women, 91 men, 38.81+/-11.40 years) were included in the study. There was a significant increase in HDL-c levels from baseline to day 10 (42.93+/-5.00 vs 43.52+/-5.07 mg/dL, P = 0.043). Notably, HDL-c was significantly improved in those for whom the baseline HDL-c levels were lower than the recommended values. Also, there was a reduction in blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, and improvement in other lipid profile variables. CONCLUSION: This yoga-based lifestyle intervention significantly increased HDL-c levels in a short duration of 10 days. This has additional clinical relevance as HDL-c is suggested to be one of the strongest statistically independent predictors of major cardiovascular events.

25637153	"I'm 100% for it! I'm a convert!": women's experiences of a yoga programme during treatment for gynaecological cancer; an interpretative phenomenological analysis.	OBJECTIVES: To explore patients' experiences of taking part in a yoga intervention while undergoing treatment for gynaecological cancer. DESIGN: Sixteen women (age range 31-79 years; mean age 60) participated in focus groups based on a semi-structured question schedule. Resulting discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). SETTING: Royal Derby Hospital, UK. INTERVENTIONS: Patients took part in a 10-week course of Hatha yoga, where they participated in a one hour long class per week. RESULTS: Three themes emerged from the data: applying breathing techniques, engaging in the physicality of yoga and finding a community. The first theme was particularly important to the patients as they noted the breadth and applicability of the techniques in their day-to-day lives. The latter two themes reflect physical and social perspectives, which are established topics in the cancer and yoga literature and are contextualised here within the women's experiences of cancer treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The women's perceptions of the programme were generally positive, providing a previously unseen view of the patient experience of participating in a yoga intervention. The difference between the women's prior expectations and lived experiences is discussed.	Archer, S;Phillips, E;Montague, J;Bali, A;Sowter, H	2015 Feb
25632177	Management of obstructed defecation.	The management of obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS) is mainly conservative and mainly consists of fiber diet, bulking laxatives, rectal irrigation or hydrocolontherapy, biofeedback, transanal electrostimulation, yoga and psychotherapy. According to our experience, nearly 20% of the patients need surgical treatment. If we consider ODS an "iceberg syndrome", with "emerging rocks", rectocele and rectal internal mucosal prolapse, that may benefit from surgery, at least two out of ten patients also has "underwater rocks" or occult disorders, such as anismus, rectal hyposensation and anxiety/depression, which mostly require conservative treatment. Rectal prolapse excision or obliterative suture, rectocele and/or enterocele repair, retrograde Malone's enema and partial myotomy of the puborectalis muscle are effective in selected cases. Laparoscopic ventral sacral colporectopexy may be an effective surgical option. Stapled transanal rectal resection may lead to severe complications. The Transtar procedure seems to be safer, when dealing with recto-rectal intussusception. A multidisciplinary approach to ODS provides the best results.

25627668	Who practices yoga? A systematic review of demographic, health-related, and psychosocial factors associated with yoga practice.	Yoga has become increasingly popular in the US and around the world, yet because most yoga research is conducted as clinical trials or experiments, little is known about the characteristics and correlates of people who independently choose to practice yoga. We conducted a systematic review of this issue, identifying 55 studies and categorizing correlates of yoga practice into sociodemographics, psychosocial characteristics, and mental and physical well-being. Yoga use is greatest among women and those with higher socioeconomic status and appears favorably related to psychosocial factors such as coping and mindfulness. Yoga practice often relates to better subjective health and health behaviors but also with more distress and physical impairment. However, evidence is sparse and methodological limitations preclude drawing causal inferences. Nationally representative studies have minimally assessed yoga while studies with strong assessment of yoga practice (e.g., type, dose) are generally conducted with convenience samples. Almost all studies reviewed are cross-sectional and few control for potential confounding variables. We provide recommendations for future research to better understand the correlates of yoga practice.	Park, Crystal L;Braun, Tosca;Siegel, Tamar	2015 Jun
25624697	Safety and usefulness of Laghu shankha prakshalana in patients with essential hypertension: A self controlled clinical study.	BACKGROUND: Yoga and Ayurveda texts emphasize the role of cleansing the bowel as an important component of management of hypertension (HTN). Observations during our clinical experience and pilot studies on Laghu shankha prakshalana kriya (LSP), a yogic bowel cleansing technique, appeared to be safe and complimentary. OBJECTIVE: To test the safety and effectiveness of LSP in patients with essential hypertension. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This self control study recruited 32 patients with mild to moderate essential HTN admitted for a week long residential integrated yoga therapy program at the integrative health home in Bengaluru. Patients had a daily routine of 6 hours of integrated approach of yoga therapy (IAYT) module for HTN that included physical postures, relaxation sessions, pranayama and meditations. LSP, an additional practice, that involved drinking of luke-warm water (with or without a herbal combination, triphala) followed by a set of specific yoga postures that activates defecation reflex, was administered on 2(nd) (LSP without triphala) and 5(th) day (LSP with triphala). Assessments (sitting blood pressure and pulse rate) were done just before and after both the sessions of LSP. Secondary outcome measures such as body mass index (BMI), symptom scores, medication scores, fatigue, state and trait anxiety, general health and quality of life were assessed on 1(st) and 6(th) day of IAYT intervention. RESULTS: There was significant (P < 0.001, paired t test) reduction in blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and pulse rate immediately after both the sessions (LSP with and without triphala). There were no adverse effects reported during or after LSP. There was no significant difference between the two techniques (P < 0.505, independent samples t test), although the percentage change appeared to be higher after triphala LSP session. The number of visits to clear the bowel during the procedure was significantly (P < 0.001, independent samples t test) higher after LSP with triphala than LSP without triphala. After weeklong IAYT, there were significant reductions in blood pressure (P < 0.001), BMI (P < 0.004), medication score (P < 0.001), symptoms score (P < 0.001), fatigue (P < 0.001), state and trait anxiety (STAI, P < 0.001), scores of general ill health (GHQ, P < 0.001), and increase in comfort level (P < 0.001) and quality of sleep (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: LSP (a part of IAYT) is a safe and useful procedure for patients with essential hypertension. LSP with triphala is more useful.

25624693	Development and initial standardization of Ayurveda child personality inventory.	BACKGROUND: Ayurveda inventories for prakriti (constitution) have been developed and validated for adults. Children, however, require different categories of quarter and questions, for example, to assess the intelligence, the questions can be related to their scholastic performances. OBJECTIVE: To develop and standardize an inventory to assess the prakriti of the children, and to compare with Child Personality Questionnaire (CPQ). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 135-item Ayurveda child personality inventory (ACPI) scale was developed on the basis of translation of Sanskrit verses describing vataja (A), pittaja (B), and kaphaja prakriti (C) characteristics and by taking the opinions of experts (ten Ayurveda experts and three psychologists). Study was carried out in Maxwell public school, Bangalore. The scale was administered on parents of children of the age group 6-12 years. CPQ was administered on children of the age group 8-12 years. RESULTS: The ACPI was associated with excellent internal consistency. The Cronbach's alpha for A, B, and C scales were 0.77, 0.55, and 0.84, respectively, and the Split-half reliability scores were 0.66.0.39 and 0.84, respectively. Factor validity coefficient scores on each items was above 0.5. Scores on vataja, pittaja and kaphaja scales were inversely correlated. Items of V, P, and K scales showed significant correlation (values ranging from 0.39 to 0.84) with subscales of CPQ, which indicates that Eastern and Western psychology concept have good correspondence. CONCLUSIONS: The prakrti of the children can be measured consistently by this instrument. Scores on V and P scale showed good correlation with the anxiety primary scale of CPQ.

25621777	[Cancer-related fatigue].	Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a very common and distressing symptom experienced by most cancer patients, during and after treatments and also at the end of life. There is no accepted definition of CRF, because it is a multifaceted symptom that involves multiple biopsychosocial aspects. Several scales for assessing CRF have been used, unidimensional or multidimensional, but there is no agreement regarding the best instrument to measure CRF. Concerning the CRF treatment, pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions have been used. Pharmacologic therapies have been evaluated in few randomized clinical trials: corticosteroids demonstrated a superior efficacy to the placebo in terminal cancer patients; psychostimulants (methylfenidate, dexamphetamine, modafinil), antidepressant (paroxetine), acetilcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil), l-carnitine and coenzyme Q(10) generally have reported negative results. Non-pharmacologic interventions (physical exercise, psychosocial interventions and other integrative interventions, such as yoga, ginseng, acupuncture) have been evaluated in several randomized and non-randomized studies, but with many methodological limitations. Therefore, the most effective non-pharmacological intervention remains unclear and the effect sizes are small. Further research is needed to delineate the optimal definition, measurement and treatment of CRF.	Fatigoni, Sonia;Fumi, Guglielmo;Roila, Fausto	2015 Jan

25617154	A pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of individualized yoga for inpatient children receiving intensive chemotherapy.	BACKGROUND: Fatigue is an important problem in paediatric cancer patients and yoga may be an effective intervention. The primary objective was to determine the feasibility of individualized yoga for hospitalized children receiving intensive chemotherapy. METHODS: We included English-speaking children and adolescents aged 7-18 years receiving intensive chemotherapy or haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Yoga was conducted three times weekly for three weeks. The primary outcome was feasibility, defined as ability to deliver at least 60% of planned sessions. Secondary outcomes were parent-reported Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) Multidimensional Fatigue Scale, Fatigue Scale-Parent, PedsQL Generic Core Scales and PedsQL Acute Cancer Module. RESULTS: Between January and October 2013, 11 patients were enrolled. Median age was 14.0 (range 7.7-16.4) years and 6 (55%) were boys. Yoga was feasible with 10/11 participants meeting the threshold for feasibility. The median number of yoga sessions was 9 (range 3-13). No adverse events were attributed to yoga. Mean+/-standard deviation for the day 21 proxy-reported PedsQL general fatigue scores was 55.6+/-15.5. Qualitative comments suggested design changes for future yoga studies. CONCLUSIONS: Individualized yoga is feasible for inpatient children receiving intensive chemotherapy. Future work will include development and conduct of a randomized trial for fatigue amelioration.

25607119	Rhythmic breathing: immunological, biochemical, and physiological effects on health.	Yoga and breathing techniques have become increasingly popular in recent decades. Sudarshan Kriya (SK) is a type of rhythmic and controlled breathing that involves cyclic breathing in which long breaths are followed by medium and short breaths. Scientific research has been conducted to study the effects of SK on different physiological parameters. Various studies have shown that the technique is simple and cost effective and can be used as a complementary therapy, together with ongoing conventional treatments, to help people suffering from extreme levels of stress, anxiety, and other physical problems. Studies have demonstrated that SK can play an important role in promoting a healthy lifestyle by improving immunity, antioxidant status, hormonal status, and brain functioning. Through available scientific evidence and research, the current article aims to review the complementary role of rhythmic breathing (ie, SK) as a practical and effective tool to alleviate stress, improve health, and increase wellness.

25603746	Yoga therapy and ambulatory multiple sclerosis Assessment of gait analysis parameters, fatigue and balance.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Gait impairment, falls due to balance problems and fatigue are among the most important complaints in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and cause significant functional limitation. Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to help symptom management and to improve quality of life is growing among MS patients. Yoga is widely used as one of these CAM interventions, however, the number of studies that show the efficacy of yoga training in MS is inadequate. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of a short term yoga program on fatigue, balance and gait in patients with MS. METHOD: Eight volunteer ambulatory MS patients with clinically definite relapsing remitting MS whose Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) is less than or equal to 6.0, and eight healthy subjects were included in the study. Patients participated in 12 weeks of a bi-weekly yoga program under supervision. At their baseline and after yoga therapy, the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and Berg Balance Scale (BBS) are used to assess fatigue and balance. Three dimensional gait analysis is done using the Vicon 612 system with six cameras and two Bertec force plates, before and after therapy. RESULTS: After short term yoga therapy, statistically significant achievements were obtained in fatigue, balance, step length and walking speed. Although sagittal plane pelvis and hip angles, ankle plantar flexor moment, powers generated at the hip and ankle joints at the pre-swing were improved, the improvements were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Yoga therapy is a safe and beneficial intervention for improving fatigue, balance and spatiotemporal gait parameters in patients with MS. Further studies with a larger sample size and longer follow-up will be needed to evaluate the long term effects of yoga therapy.	Guner, Senem;Inanici, Fatma	2015 Jan
25603649	Hot yoga establishments in local communities serving pregnant women: a pilot study on the health implications of its practice and environmental conditions.	Hot yoga establishments have been increasing in popularity in local communities. Studios may support participation among pregnant women though no clinical studies currently exist that examine prenatal hot yoga effects. The pilot study described in this article aimed to assess the spread of prenatal hot yoga and to provide information on the environmental conditions and practices of those who engage in hot yoga within a local community. A thermal environment meter was used to measure ambient air conditions during three 90-minute hot yoga classes. Mothers who practiced prenatal hot yoga were more likely than non-hot yoga practitioners to have someone aside from an obstetrician/gynecologist discuss prenatal exercise safety with them. Prenatal public health education campaigns need to be refined. Public health officials and obstetricians/gynecologists need to be aware that those who engage in a hot yoga practice are more likely to trust someone other than their health care provider or public health professional regarding safety of this practice.

25593785	Feasibility and Acceptability of an Internet-Based, African Dance-Modified Yoga Program for African-American Women with or at Risk for Metabolic Syndrome.	African-American (AA) women are the segment of the population that experiences the highest mortality from metabolic syndrome (MetS). Yoga decreases risk of MetS, yet there have been no yoga studies of AA women with or at risk for MetS. The purpose of this 4-week study was to test the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally tailored, Internet-based intervention, yogic dance (YD), using digital videos in a sample of AA women (ages 35-64) at risk for or with MetS. The investigators examined the rates of accrual, attrition, and reasons for attrition; the feasibility of using the Internet to deliver the intervention; the acceptability of the intervention as structured; and any other benefits and/or limitations of YD. The study used a single-group, mixed-methods design underpinned by social constructivist theory and Pender's Health Promotion Model. Twenty-four women provided consent to enroll in the study. After completing in-person semi-structured interviews and Internet-based measures, including the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire, and the modified International Physical Activity Questionnaire, consented participants engaged in 4-weeks of the yogic dance intervention via daily video-based instructions located on the study Web site. After the intervention, four women participated in focus groups to voice their perceptions of barriers to and benefits from YD and the acceptability of using the YD intervention. The investigators analyzed focus group data using content/thematic analysis and validated themes with baseline semi-structured interviews. The majority of the women (79%) found YD acceptable. Themes that emerged from the descriptive data include: (1) Culture is an important aspect of yogic dance; and (2) Increased social support would enhance yogic dance participation. The integrated results from this feasibility study will inform research exploring the complex correlates that influence health behaviors in AA women.

25593403	Yoga: As an adjunct therapy to trim down the Ayurvedic drug requirement in non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.	INTRODUCTION: In spite of a large number of drugs showing anti-hyperglycemic activities, none of them have been successful in complete management of diabetes mellitus (DM). Yoga and Ayurveda are the two schools of thought in India, which have a history of curing diseases since thousands of years. Yogic techniques and Ayurvedic herbs have proven their anti-diabetic potential without inducing untoward effects. The present study combines Ayurvedic medication with Yoga techniques as a new approach toward healing DM. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of Yoga therapy in the management of non insulin-dependent DM (NIDDM) and to decrease the oral drug dose requirement of guduci ghana Tablet. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty known NIDDM patients of both genders, who were on guduci ghana (solidified aqueous extract of Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers.) tablets from past 2 months as Ayurvedic remedy for DM were selected. Along with guduci ghana administration, the subjects were instructed to follow Yogic procedures including Asanas, pranayama, and suddhi kriyas. The study was conducted for 8 weeks, wherein fasting blood sugar (FBS) and postprandial blood sugar (PPBS) levels along with relief in sign and symptoms were assessed at every 2 weeks intervals, and according to relief in sign and symptoms, tapering of drug dosage was carried out. The obtained data were analyzed statistically by applying paired t-test. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The results obtained were promising as the relief in diabetic symptomatology was highly significant in terms of P value. 80.83% reduction in dose of guduci ghana tablets and 7.85% and 8.78% fall in FBS and PPBS levels, respectively, after the complete course of treatment. The obtained P value showed highly significant results.	Sharma, Rohit;Amin, Hetal;Prajapati, P K	2014 Apr-Jun

25583571	Impact of long-term meditation practice on cardiovascular reactivity during perception and reappraisal of affective images.	Meditation has been found to be an efficient strategy for coping with stress in healthy individuals and in patients with psychosomatic disorders. The main objective of the present study was to investigate the psychophysiological mechanisms of beneficial effects of meditation on cardiovascular reactivity. We examined effects of long-term Sahaja Yoga meditation on cardiovascular reactivity during affective image processing under "unregulated" and "emotion regulation" conditions. Twenty two experienced meditators and 20 control subjects participated in the study. Under "unregulated" conditions participants were shown neutral and affective images and were asked to attend to them. Under "emotion regulation" conditions they down-regulated negative affect through reappraisal of negative images or up-regulated positive affect through reappraisal of positive images. Under "unregulated" conditions while anticipating upcoming images meditators vs. controls did not show larger pre-stimulus total peripheral resistance and greater cardiac output for negative images in comparison with neutral and positive ones. Control subjects showed TPR decrease for negative images only when they consciously intended to reappraise them (i.e. in the "emotion regulation" condition). Both meditators and controls showed comparable cardiovascular reactivity during perception of positive stimuli, whereas up-regulating of positive affect was associated with more pronounced cardiac activation in meditators. The findings provide some insight into understanding the beneficial influence of meditation on top-down control of emotion and cardiovascular reactivity.

25577932		Hot flashes, or hot flashes, are sudden and transient periods of feeling hot and sweating, with possible co-occurrence of palpitations and anxiety. Hot flashes occur in about 80% to 90% of post-menopausal women and in 51% to 81% of women with breast cancer. The physiological mechanisms of hot flashes are still not clear but seem to involve neurochemical and thermoregulatory interruptions. Generally, therapeutic options for hot flashes include pharmaceutical/hormone replacement therapies (e.g., estrogen and progesterone, antidepressants such as venlafaxine, anticonvulsants such as pregabalin, antiadrenergics such as clonidine, anticholinergics such as bellergal), nutraceutical therapies (e.g., herbals, vitamins, phytoestrogens), and complementary/behavioral therapies (e.g., acupuncture, yoga). Stellate ganglion block (SGB), a procedure aiming to selectively block the sympathetic outflow from a stellate ganglion by injecting an anesthetic such as bupivacaine with fluoroscopic guidance around the ganglion, has been used as a treatment of migraines, atypical facial pain, upper extremity pain, and complex regional pain syndrome. SGB recently emerged as a surgical therapy for hot flashes based on the belief that interruptions of the connections between a stellate ganglion and areas of the central nervous system may induce the reset of the body temperature mechanisms. This Rapid Response report aims to review the clinical, cost effectiveness and guidelines of the use of SGB in the treatment of hot flashes in women.		2014 Apr 14
25574576	Effects of relaxation interventions on depression and anxiety among older adults: a systematic review.	OBJECTIVES: This systematic review examined empirical evidence of the effects of relaxation interventions on anxiety and depression among older adults. METHOD: A comprehensive literature search identified studies that satisfied the pre-set inclusion and exclusion criteria. We focused on 15 published and non-published studies - 12 randomised controlled trials and three non-randomised controlled trials - undertaken in the past 20 years (1994-2014). Three reviewers selected studies, extracted data, and appraised the methodological quality. We then computed Hedges' effect sizes and used these to represent the effects of intervention. RESULTS: Our findings suggested that older adults who received relaxation interventions experienced greater reductions in depression and anxiety than controls in most studies. Progressive muscle relaxation training, music intervention, and yoga had the strongest intervention effects on depression. Music intervention, yoga, and combined relaxation training most effectively reduced anxiety symptoms among older adults. Furthermore, the impact of some relaxation interventions remained in effect for between 14 and 24 weeks after the interventions. CONCLUSION: This systematic review supported the positive effects of relaxation interventions on depression and anxiety among older adults. Health care providers may integrate relaxation interventions into standard care for older adults in community and hospital settings, taking into consideration the participant's preference and health care policy.

25568820	Serial case reporting yoga for idiopathic and degenerative scoliosis.	BACKGROUND: Non-surgical techniques for treating scoliosis frequently focus on realigning the spine, typically by muscular relaxation or muscular or ligamentous stretching. However, such treatments, which include physical therapeutic, chiropractic, and bracing techniques, are inconsistently supported by current evidence. In this study, we assess the possible benefits of asymmetrical strengthening of truncal muscles on the convex side of the scoliotic curve through a single yoga pose, the side plank pose, in idiopathic and degenerative scoliosis. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with idiopathic or degenerative scoliosis and primary curves measuring 6 to 120 degrees by the Cobb method had spinal radiographs and were then taught the side plank pose. After 1 week performing the pose with convexity downward for 10 to 20 seconds, they were instructed to maintain the posture once daily for as long as possible on that one side only. A second series of spinal radiographs was taken 3 to 22 months later. Pre- and post-yoga Cobb measurements were compared. RESULTS: The mean self-reported practice of the yoga pose was 1.5 minutes per day, 6.1 days per week, for a mean follow-up period of 6.8 months. Among all patients, a significant improvement in the Cobb angle of the primary scoliotic curve of 32.0% was found. Among 19 compliant patients, the mean improvement rose to 40.9%. Improvements did not differ significantly among adolescent idiopathic and degenerative subtypes (49.6% and 38.4%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Asymmetrically strengthening the convex side of the primary curve with daily practice of the side plank pose held for as long as possible for an average of 6.8 months significantly reduced the angle of primary scoliotic curves. These results warrant further testing.	Fishman, Loren M;Groessl, Erik J;Sherman, Karen J	2014 Sep
25567329	Do yoga and aerobic exercise training have impact on functional capacity, fatigue, peripheral muscle strength, and quality of life in breast cancer survivors?	AIM: The aim of the study was to compare the effects of aerobic exercise training and yoga on the functional capacity, peripheral muscle strength, quality of life (QOL), and fatigue in breast cancer survivors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 52 patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer were included in the study. The patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups: aerobic exercise (n = 28) and yoga added to aerobic exercise (n = 24). Both groups participated in submaximal exercise 30 minutes/d, 3 d/wk for 6 weeks. The second group participated in a 1-hour yoga program in addition to aerobic exercise training. Functional capacity was assessed by the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT). Peripheral muscle strength was evaluated with a hand-held dynamometer. The fatigue severity level was assessed with the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS). The QOL was determined by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire. RESULTS: There were statistically significant increases in peripheral muscle strength, the 6MWT distance, and the perception of QOL in both groups (P < .05). Additionally, the group with aerobic exercise and yoga showed marked improvement compared with the aerobic exercise group in fatigue perception (P < .05). CONCLUSION: According to the data from this study, aerobic exercise training and yoga improved the functional capacity and QOL of breast cancer patients.

25566158	Meditation reduces pain-related neural activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, insula, secondary somatosensory cortex, and thalamus.	Recent studies have shown that meditation inhibits or relieves pain perception. To clarify the underlying mechanisms for this phenomenon, neuroimaging methods, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging, and neurophysiological methods, such as magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography, have been used. However, it has been difficult to interpret the results, because there is some paradoxical evidence. For example, some studies reported increased neural responses to pain stimulation during meditation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula, whereas others showed a decrease in these regions. There have been inconsistent findings to date. Moreover, in general, since the activities of the ACC and insula are correlated with pain perception, the increase in neural activities during meditation would be related to the enhancement of pain perception rather than its reduction. These contradictions might directly contribute to the 'mystery of meditation.' In this review, we presented previous findings for brain regions during meditation and the anatomical changes that occurred in the brain with long-term meditation training. We then discussed the findings of previous studies that examined pain-related neural activity during meditation. We also described the brain mechanisms responsible for pain relief during meditation, and possible reasons for paradoxical evidence among previous studies. By thoroughly overviewing previous findings, we hypothesized that meditation reduces pain-related neural activity in the ACC, insula, secondary somatosensory cortex, and thalamus. We suggest that the characteristics of the modulation of this activity may depend on the kind of meditation and/or number of years of experience of meditation, which were associated with paradoxical findings among previous studies that investigated pain-related neural activities during meditation.

25560636	Could yoga practice improve treatment-related side effects and quality of life for women with breast cancer? A systematic review and meta-analysis.	AIM: To determine if yoga as a complementary and alternative therapy was associated with enhanced health and treatment-related side effects in patients with breast cancer. This systematic review examines whether yoga practice provides any measurable benefit, both physically and psychologically, for women with breast cancer. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) throughout June 2013. We evaluated the quality of the included studies by the Cochrane Handbook 5.2 standards and analyzed the data using the Stata software, version 10.0. Meta-regression and subgroup analysis were also performed to identify additional predictors of outcome and to assess heterogeneity. RESULTS: Sixteen RCTs with a total of 930 participants were included. Comparing yoga groups to control groups, there was a statistically significant difference in overall health-related quality of life, depression, anxiety and gastrointestinal symptoms. Meta-regression analyses revealed that the duration of yoga practice and type of control group partly explained the heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses revealed that yoga had a positive effect on anxiety only when it had been practiced for longer than 3 months. Only the wait-list control group showed an effect of yoga on physical well-being. CONCLUSION: The current evidence demonstrates that yoga practice could be effective in enhancing health and managing some treatment-related side effects for patients recovering from breast cancer. In future clinical studies, clinicians should consider the patient's wishes along with the current best evidence of the effects of yoga practice in their clinical decision-making.

25560126	Use of complementary and alternative medicines during the third trimester.	OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence, indications, and associated factors for complementary and alternative medicine use during the last trimester of pregnancy. METHODS: A questionnaire survey was conducted of women with a live birth (N=700) admitted to the postnatal unit at the Royal Aberdeen Maternity Hospital, northeast Scotland. Outcome measures included: complementary and alternative medicine used; vitamins and minerals used; reasons for complementary and alternative medicine use; independent associated factors for use; views; and experiences. Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS: The response rate was 79.6% of eligible women. Two thirds of respondents (61.4%) reported using complementary and alternative medicine, excluding vitamins and minerals, during the third trimester. Respondents reported using a total of 30 different complementary and alternative medicine modalities, of which oral herbal products were the most common (38% of respondents, 40 different products). The independent associated factors for complementary and alternative medicine use identified were: complementary and alternative medicine use before pregnancy (odds ratio [OR] 4.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.39-7.95, P<.001); a university education (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.46-4.0, P=.001), and complementary and alternative medicine use by family or friends (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.61-3.47, P<.001). There was no association with health care professional recommendations. Users were significantly more likely than nonusers to agree that complementary and alternative medicines were safer than prescribed medicines (P=.006), less likely to be associated with side effects (P</=.001), and could interfere with conventional medicines (P</=.001). CONCLUSION: Despite the majority of respondents, and notably users, being uncertain about their safety and effectiveness, complementary and alternative medicine modalities and complementary and alternative medicine products are widely used during the third trimester of pregnancy in this study population. Although prior use was the most significant independent associated factor, the role of family and friends, rather than health professionals, in the decision to use complementary and alternative medicine may be of concern.

25559560	How does yoga reduce stress? A systematic review of mechanisms of change and guide to future inquiry.	Yoga is increasingly used in clinical settings for a variety of mental and physical health issues, particularly stress-related illnesses and concerns, and has demonstrated promising efficacy. Yet the ways in which yoga reduces stress remain poorly understood. To examine the empirical evidence regarding the mechanisms through which yoga reduces stress, we conducted a systematic review of the literature, including any yoga intervention that measured stress as a primary dependent variable and tested a mechanism of the relationship with mediation. Our electronic database search yielded 926 abstracts, of which 71 were chosen for further inspection and 5 were selected for the final systematic review. These five studies examined three psychological mechanisms (positive affect, mindfulness and self-compassion) and four biological mechanisms (posterior hypothalamus, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein and cortisol). Positive affect, self-compassion, inhibition of the posterior hypothalamus and salivary cortisol were all shown to mediate the relationship between yoga and stress. It is striking that the literature describing potential mechanisms is growing rapidly, yet only seven mechanisms have been empirically examined; more research is necessary. Also, future research ought to include more rigorous methodology, including sufficient power, study randomisation and appropriate control groups.	Riley, Kristen E;Park, Crystal L	2015

25558138	A randomized controlled pilot study of the therapeutic effects of yoga in people with Parkinson's disease.	BACKGROUND: Exercise can be beneficial for cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal or neurological systems, and other factors including mood, and may be beneficial in reducing fall risks, dementia and variables associated with quality of life (QOL). Parkinson's disease (PD) produces progressive motor and cognitive deterioration that may leave those inflicted unable to participate in standard exercise programs. Alternative forms of exercise such as yoga may be successful in improving physical function, QOL and physiological variables for overall well-being. AIM: This randomized controlled pilot study investigated the effectiveness of yoga intervention on physiological and health-related QOL measures in people with PD. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirteen people with stage 1-2 PD were randomized to either a yoga (n = 8) or a control group (n = 5). The yoga group participated in twice-weekly yoga sessions for 12 weeks. Participants were tested at baseline, and at 6 and 12 weeks using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), clinical measures of health-related QOL and physiological measures. RESULTS: Significant improvement in UPDRS scores (P = .006), diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.036) and average forced vital capacity (P = 0.03) was noted in the yoga group over time. Changes between groups were also noted in two SF-36 subscales. Positive trends of improvement were noted in depression scores (P = 0.056), body weight (P = 0.056) and forced expiratory volume (P = 0.059). Yoga participants reported more positive symptom changes including immediate tremor reduction. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that yoga may improve aspects of QOL and physiological functions in stages 1-2 PD. Future larger studies are needed to confirm and extend our findings of the effects of yoga in PD.	Sharma, Neena K;Robbins, Kristin;Wagner, Kathleen;Colgrove, Yvonne M	2015 Jan
25558137	Immediate effect of mind sound resonance technique on state anxiety and cognitive functions in patients suffering from generalized anxiety disorder: A self-controlled pilot study.	OBJECTIVES: To compare the immediate effect of mind sound resonance technique (MSRT) with supine rest (SR) on state anxiety and psychomotor performance in 15 (eight male and seven female) right-handed generalized anxiety disorder patients (GAD) with an age range of 34.8 +/- 12.8 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Self as control design was followed. Diagnosis of GAD was made by a psychiatrist using sections of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Participants practiced MSRT or SR (as control intervention) for 30 min at the same time for two consecutive days. The sequence of intervention was assigned randomly to the participants. State anxiety was assessed using state trait anxiety inventory (STAI; Form X1). Digit letter substitution task (DLST) was used to assess psychomotor performance, which involves visual scanning, mental flexibility, sustained attention, psychomotor speed and speed of information processing. Intervention was given in a quiet dark room on an empty stomach. Subjects received a training of MSRT and SR for 1 week before the data were taken. A pre-recorded audiotape was used to administer the technique of MSRT. Difference in scores after baseline and intervention was used to check normality, and was found to be normally distributed by the Kolmogrov-Smirnov test. The changes in STAI, DLST and difference in scores before and after two interventions (MSRT and SR) were compared using the paired samples t test. RESULTS: As compared with baseline, STAI scores reduced and DLST scores increased significantly (STAI; P < 0.01; DLST; P < 0.01) after MSRT. After SR, there was a significant reduction in STAI scores from baseline (STAI; P < 0.05), but there was no significant change in the DLST scores (P = 0.26). Comparison of the difference in scores for DLST and STAI before and after the two interventions (MSRT and SR) showed a significantly higher score for DLST (P < 0.05) and a significantly lower score for STAI (P < 0.01) for MSRT as compared with SR. CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that MSRT may have a potential role in reducing state anxiety and enhancing psychomotor performance in patients suffering from GAD immediately after the practice. These findings need confirmation from studies with a larger sample size and randomized controlled design, which are implicated in the future.	Dhansoia, Vipin;Bhargav, Hemant;Metri, Kashinath	2015 Jan
25558136	Effect of yoga regimen on lung functions including diffusion capacity in coronary artery disease patients.		Yadav, Raj Kumar	2015 Jan
25558135	Effect of yoga regimen on lung functions including diffusion capacity in coronary artery disease patients: A randomized controlled study.	BACKGROUND: Lung functions are found to be impaired in coronary artery disease (CAD), congestive heart failure, left ventricular dysfunction, and after cardiac surgery. Diffusion capacity progressively worsens as the severity of CAD increases due to reduction in lung tissue participating in gas exchange. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Pranayama breathing exercises and yogic postures may play an impressive role in improving cardio-respiratory efficiency and facilitating gas diffusion at the alveolo-capillary membrane. This study was done to see the effect of yoga regimen on lung functions particularly diffusion capacity in CAD patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 80 stable CAD patients below 65 years of age of both sexes were selected and randomized into two groups of 40 each. Group I CAD patients were given yoga regimen for 3 months which consisted of yogic postures, pranayama breathing exercises, dietary modification, and holistic teaching along with their conventional medicine while Group II CAD patients were put only on conventional medicine. Lung functions including diffusion capacity were recorded thrice in both the groups: 0 day as baseline, 22(nd) day and on 90(th) day by using computerized MS medisoft Cardio-respiratory Instrument, HYP'AIR Compact model of cardio-respiratory testing machine was manufactured by P K Morgan, India. The recorded parameters were statistically analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA followed by Tukey's test in both the groups. Cardiovascular parameters were also compared before and after intervention in both the groups. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements were seen in slow vital capacity, forced vital capacity, peak expiratory flow rate, maximum voluntary ventilation, and diffusion factor/ transfer factor of lung for carbon monoxide after 3 months of yoga regimen in Group I. Forced expiratory volume in 1(st) sec (FEV1), and FEV1 % also showed a trend toward improvement although not statistically significant. HR, SBP and DBP also showed significant improvement in Group-I patients who followed yoga regimen. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga regimen was found to improve lung functions and diffusion capacity in CAD patients besides improving cardiovascular functions. Thus, it can be used as a complimentary or adjunct therapy along with the conventional medicine for their treatment and rehabilitation.	Yadav, Asha;Singh, Savita;Singh, Kp;Pai, Preeti	2015 Jan
25558134	Yoga for correction of lymphedema's impairment of gait as an adjunct to lymphatic drainage: A pilot observational study.	INTRODUCTION: Yoga used as a major component of integrative treatment protocol in 14 Indian village camps improved quality-of-life in 425 lymphatic filariasis patients. They experienced better mobility and reduced disability. This paper documents the gait abnormalities observed in lower limb lymphedema patients and the locomotor changes following integrative treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Yoga postures were performed as explained by traditional yoga practice in two sessions: Before ayurvedic oil massage without compression bandages and after the massage with compression bandages. Each yoga posture lasted for 5 min and the whole session ended in 45 min. Throughout each session, we advised patients to do long, diaphragmatic breathing, concentrating on each breath. The flexion of joints was coordinated with exhalation and extension with inhalation. We educated the patients to do longer expiration than inspiration. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A total of 98 patients (133 limbs) attending the 6(th) month follow-up were evaluated. The most common gait abnormality was antalgic gait. Structural and functional abnormalities were observed in hip, knee and ankle joints. We found that yoga as an adjunct to other components in integrative treatment improved the gait problems. Long standing lymphedema caused altered gait and joint deformities. This was mostly due to inactivity causing muscle weakness and edema within and around the muscles. Both large and small limbs have shown significant volume reduction (P < 0.01) during follow-up after 6 months. CONCLUSION: There can be a mixed etiology for gait related problems in lymphedema patients. Further studies are recommended to understand the causes of deformities in lymphedema patients and an exact role of yoga.	Aggithaya, Madhur Guruprasad;Narahari, Saravu R;Ryan, Terence J	2015 Jan
25558133	Effectiveness of pranayama on cancer-related fatigue in breast cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy: A randomized controlled trial.	CONTEXT: Incidence of breast cancer is very high among women around the world. Breast cancer patients experience cancer-related fatigue at some points during the treatment for breast cancer. Since cancer-related fatigue is of multifactorial origin, there are no evidence-based treatment strategies for fatigue. This study tested the effectiveness of certain pranayama techniques in reducing cancer-related fatigue among breast cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy. AIMS: The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of pranayama on cancer-related fatigue among breast cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy as measured by cancer fatigue scale. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Shirdi Sai Baba Cancer Hospital and Research Center, Kasturba Hospital Manipal. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study was a randomized controlled trial done among breast cancer patients receiving radiation therapy. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Demographic characteristics of the participants are presented as frequency and percentage. Comparison of means of cancer-related fatigue between the two groups is done by Mann-Whitney U-test and comparison of pre- and pos t-test means of cancer-related fatigue among the experimental group is done by Wilcoxon sign rank test. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between the two groups with regard to the scores of cancer-related fatigue. The experimental group of patients who performed pranayama along with radiation therapy experienced less fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Pranayama can be used as a supportive therapy for breast cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy.

25558132	Age related differences of selected Hatha yoga practices on anthropometric characteristics, muscular strength and flexibility of healthy individuals.	BACKGROUND: Physiological benefits of yoga on volunteers of a particular age group are available. However, reports on efficacy of a specific yoga package on the populace of different age groups from similar occupational background is still very limited. Therefore, the present study was conducted to appraise the effect of a specific Hatha yoga package on anthropometric characteristics, flexibility and muscular strength of healthy individuals of different age groups from similar occupational trade. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 71 participants (Group All) from Indian Air Force ground personnel volunteered and age wise divided into 3 groups - (i) Group I (Gr. - I) (n1 = 27, 20-29 years), (ii) Group II (Gr. - II) (n2 = 21, 30-39 years) and (iii) Group III (Gr. - III) (n3 = 23, 40-49 years). All the participants undergone selected Hatha yoga training for 1 h daily for a period of 12 weeks. Parameters were recorded before and after the training. Pre and post training differences were assessed by Student's t-test. RESULTS: Body weight (All, Gr. - II and Gr. - III [all P < 0.05]), body mass index (Gr. - II and Gr. - III [both P < 0.01]) and fat% (Gr. - II and III [both P < 0.05]) were decreased significantly. Neck circumference was increased significantly in Gr. - I (P < 0.05) but decreased significantly in Gr. - III (P < 0.05). Chest circumference (All (P < 0.001), in Gr. - I and II [both P < 0.05]), grip strength (All [left: P < 0.01 and right: P < 0.05], in Gr. - I [left: P < 0.05 and right: P < 0.01], in Gr. - II [right: P < 0.05] and in Gr. - III [left: P < 0.05 and right: P < 0.01]), back leg strength (group wise P < 0.001, P < 0.05, P < 0.01 and P < 0.05 respectively) and flexibility (all P < 0.001) were increased significantly. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION: Hatha yoga can improve anthropometric characteristics, muscular strength and flexibility among volunteers of different age group and can also be helpful in preventing and attenuating age related deterioration of these parameters.

25558131	Suryanamaskar: An equivalent approach towards management of physical fitness in obese females.	BACKGROUND: In India, obesity is highly prevalent in women as compared to men. As the obesity epidemic spreads, there are growing concerns about efficient obesity management. AIMS: To compare between circuit training (CT), treadmill (TM) walking and suryanamaskar (SN) training in weight management and physical fitness enhancement in obese females. SETTINGS AND DESIGNS: Comparative controlled study conducted in a community setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 119 females of age between 20 and 40 years of body mass index (BMI) between 25.1 and 34.9 kg/m(2). 87 participants completed the study. Group 1: CT; group 2: TM walking; group 3: Modified SN; group 4: Control. OUTCOME MEASURES: Body composition, cardio-respiratory and muscle endurance, flexibility. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Within-group data was analyzed with the paired t-test. P =0.05. Analysis between the groups was done using one way ANOVA test. Analysis between the groups was done using ANCOVA test controlling for baseline differences only for those variables that have significant differences at baseline. For those which do not have significant difference at baseline, RMANOVA was done at end of 8 weeks. RESULTS: Reducation in mean body weight in CT group (2.2%), TM (1.7%) and SN (1.6%), (P < 0.05), BMI in all the three groups (P < 0.01), total body fat % in the CT (5%) and SN (3.7%), (P < 0.01), metabolic age with CT (2%) and TM (2%), (P = 0.001). Improvement in muscle mass in CT (4%, P = 0.009), VO2max in CT group by 17.2%, SN (14%), TM group (8%) (P < 0.05). Upper limb Muscle endurance in CT (51.3%), SN group (51.24%) and in TM group (40%), (P = 0.05), in lower limb TM (21.2%) and SN (24.5%) (P = 0.05), flexibility in SN (12.4%, P = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: All three methods were effective in weight and physical fitness management. CT and SN were more effective in improving cardio-respiratory fitness and upper limb muscle endurance while only SN was effective in improving body flexibility.

25558130	Comparative effect of 12 weeks of slow and fast pranayama training on pulmonary function in young, healthy volunteers: A randomized controlled trial.	CONTEXT: Pranayamas are breathing techniques that exert profound physiological effects on pulmonary, cardiovascular, and mental functions. Previous studies demonstrate that different types of pranayamas produce divergent effects. AIM: The aim was to compare the effect of 12 weeks of slow and fast pranayama training on pulmonary function in young, healthy volunteers. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This study was carried out in Departments of Physiology and ACYTER, Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, Puducherry in 2011. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Ninety one healthy volunteers were randomized into slow pranayama group (SPG), n =29, fast pranayama group (FPG), n = 32 and control groups (CG) (n = 30). Supervised pranayama training (SPG: Nadisodhana, Pranav pranayama and Savitri pranayama; FPG: Kapalabhati, Bhastrika and Kukkriya pranayama) was given for 30 min/day, thrice/week for 12 weeks by certified yoga instructors. Pulmonary function parameters (PFT) such as forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV1), ratio between FEV1 and FVC (FEV1 /FVC), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), and forced expiratory flow25-75 (FEF25-75), were recorded at baseline and after 12 weeks of pranayama training using the computerized spirometer (Micro laboratory V1.32, England). RESULTS: In SPG, PEFR, and FEF25-75 improved significantly (P < 0.05) while other parameters (FVC, FEV1, FEV1 /FVC, and MVV) showed only marginal improvements. In FPG, FEV1 /FVC, PEFR, and FEF25-75 parameters improved significantly (P < 0.05), while FVC, FEV1, and MVV did not show significant (P > 0.05) change. No significant change was observed in CG. CONCLUSION: Twelve weeks of pranayama training in young subjects showed improvement in the commonly measured PFT. This indicates that pranayama training improved pulmonary function and that this was more pronounced in the FPG.

25558129	Effects of suryanamaskar on relaxation among college students with high stress in Pune, India.	CONTEXT: Suryanamaskar is a yogic practice widely practiced across India. Along with the available studies on physiology, there is a need to study its psychological effects. AIMS: This research aims at studying the effects of suryanamaskar on relaxation dispositions (R-dispositions) among college students with high stress in Pune, India. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The present study was conducted in a college setting and used a randomized control group design. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A group of 419 college students (age 17-22 years) were assessed on stress symptoms using the ABC relaxation theory. A total of 124 out of 419 students who were identified as high on stress were randomly assigned to an experimental and control group. And 40 participants each in both the group completed the program and were assessed on R-dispositions and stress dispositions before and after the suryanamaskar program. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to study the differences in R-dispositions and stress dispositions between the experimental and control groups. RESULTS: The experimental group was found to be higher on the R-dispositions of physical relaxation, mental quiet, at ease/peace, rested and refreshed, strength and awareness and joy and lower on sleepiness, and stress dispositions-somatic stress, worry, and negative emotion compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that suryanamaskar is effective in leading to R-Dispositions like physical relaxation, mental quiet, at ease/peace, rested and refreshed, strength and awareness and joy and reduces sleepiness, somatic stress, worry and negative emotion at a dispositional level.

25558128	Effectiveness of Iyengar yoga in treating spinal (back and neck) pain: A systematic review.	Considerable amount of money spent in health care is used for treatments of lifestyle related, chronic health conditions, which come from behaviors that contribute to morbidity and mortality of the population. Back and neck pain are two of the most common musculoskeletal problems in modern society that have significant cost in health care. Yoga, as a branch of complementary alternative medicine, has emerged and is showing to be an effective treatment against nonspecific spinal pain. Recent studies have shown positive outcome of yoga in general on reducing pain and functional disability of the spine. The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review of the existing research within Iyengar yoga method and its effectiveness on relieving back and neck pain (defined as spinal pain). Database research form the following sources (Cochrane library, NCBI PubMed, the Clinical Trial Registry of the Indian Council of Medical Research, Google Scholar, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsychINFO) demonstrated inclusion and exclusion criteria that selected only Iyengar yoga interventions, which in turn, identified six randomized control trials dedicated to compare the effectiveness of yoga for back and neck pain versus other care. The difference between the groups on the postintervention pain or functional disability intensity assessment was, in all six studies, favoring the yoga group, which projected a decrease in back and neck pain. Overall six studies with 570 patients showed, that Iyengar yoga is an effective means for both back and neck pain in comparison to control groups. This systematic review found strong evidence for short-term effectiveness, but little evidence for long-term effectiveness of yoga for chronic spine pain in the patient-centered outcomes.

29522669	[Is training yoga regulary can have an effective impact on dealing with stress?].	Introduction: The word yoga (Goya) is derived from the Sanskrit yii and means: bind, connect, attach and focus attention on something. It also means connection, and the union. The system of yoga has collected and systematized Patanjali in his "Yoga Sittrach" work. Yoga has the task of shaping proper physical culture and spirit (mind), regardless of religious beliefs, national origin, membership in a social group. The aim of the study was to evaluate the relationship between yoga and regular coaching strategy for coping with stress, blood pressure and abdominal obesity. Material and methods: The study involved 100 people divided into 2 groups. The first group comprised students regularly practicing yoga. The second group were randomly selected subjects not regularly engaged in sport. The age of the subjects ranged 18-60 years and over. Research material was gathered using a questionnaire designed by the authors, and the mini -COPE test. In addition, blood pressure and waist circumference were measured to assess the prevalence of abdominal obesity. Results: Among people who practice yoga the average waist circumference was 82.8 +/-8 in women and 90.3 +/-11 in men (p < 0.034). A healthy waistline was found in 43 (86%)subjects in the yoga group, and 34 (68%) subjects in the control group. Body mass index (BMI) also falls in favour of yoga, and in this group 15 (30%) more subjects had normal BMI. Abdominal obesity and BMI indicating obesity was found in 10 (20%) subjects from the yoga group and 15 (30%) from the control group. The study revealed no significant differences in mean blood pressure between the analysed groups. Conclusions: Based on the analysis of the questionnaire mini-COPE people regularly Training Yoga choose more effective strategies for coping with stress. Regular practice of yoga is a factor in reducing abdominal obesity. Men who trains yoga have blood pressure lower than those who doesn't practice any sport.

27489754	Non-Pharmacological Treatments for ADHD in Youth.	BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in psychiatry or integrative psychiatry covers a wide range of biological, psychological and mind-body treatments that enhance standard medical practices and patient outcomes. While CAM approaches are popular amongst patients in their practice as well as in self-report because of their ease of use, health professionals have received limited education in these interventions and often are unaware of their patients' use of CAM treatments. METHOD: This overview highlights evidence-based CAM treatments for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) including dietary interventions, phytomedicines, mind-body practices and neurofeedback. RESULTS: While conventional treatments are the mainstays for ADHD, there are a large number of available treatments that can be used to enhance treatment response. CONCLUSION: With improved education and further scientific and clinical research, validated integrative treatments will provide more effective, lower risk and lower cost care for patients with ADHD.

27347478	Mind-Body Practices and the Adolescent Brain: Clinical Neuroimaging Studies.	BACKGROUND: Mind-Body practices constitute a large and diverse group of practices that can substantially affect neurophysiology in both healthy individuals and those with various psychiatric disorders. In spite of the growing literature on the clinical and physiological effects of mind-body practices, very little is known about their impact on central nervous system (CNS) structure and function in adolescents with psychiatric disorders. METHOD: This overview highlights findings in a select group of mind-body practices including yoga postures, yoga breathing techniques and meditation practices. RESULTS: Mind-body practices offer novel therapeutic approaches for adolescents with psychiatric disorders. Findings from these studies provide insights into the design and implementation of neuroimaging studies for adolescents with psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical neuroimaging studies will be critical in understanding how different practices affect disease pathogenesis and symptomatology in adolescents. Neuroimaging of mind-body practices on adolescents with psychiatric disorders will certainly be an open and exciting area of investigation.	Sharma, Anup;Newberg, Andrew B	2015
27336050	Aerobic exercise and yoga improve neurocognitive function in women with early psychosis.	Impairments of attention and memory are evident in early psychosis, and are associated with functional disability. In a group of stable, medicated women patients, we aimed to determine whether participating in aerobic exercise or yoga improved cognitive impairments and clinical symptoms. A total of 140 female patients were recruited, and 124 received the allocated intervention in a randomized controlled study of 12 weeks of yoga or aerobic exercise compared with a waitlist group. The primary outcomes were cognitive functions including memory and attention. Secondary outcome measures were the severity of psychotic and depressive symptoms, and hippocampal volume. Data from 124 patients were included in the final analysis based on the intention-to-treat principle. Both yoga and aerobic exercise groups demonstrated significant improvements in working memory (P<0.01) with moderate to large effect sizes compared with the waitlist control group. The yoga group showed additional benefits in verbal acquisition (P<0.01) and attention (P=0.01). Both types of exercise improved overall and depressive symptoms (all P0.01) after 12 weeks. Small increases in hippocampal volume were observed in the aerobic exercise group compared with waitlist (P=0.01). Both types of exercise improved working memory in early psychosis patients, with yoga having a larger effect on verbal acquisition and attention than aerobic exercise. The application of yoga and aerobic exercise as adjunctive treatments for early psychosis merits serious consideration. This study was supported by the Small Research Funding of the University of Hong Kong (201007176229), and RGC funding (C00240/762412) by the Authority of Research, Hong Kong.

27125139	Antiaging Effects of an Intensive Mind and Body Therapeutic Program through Enhancement of Telomerase Activity and Adult Stem Cell Counts.	OBJECTIVE: Key modalities of integrative medicine known to rejuvenate the mind and body are meditation, yoga, and controlled diet. It has been shown previously that intensive or prolonged mind and body therapies (MBT) may have beneficial effects on the well-being of healthy people and in patients. Telomerase activity and levels of peripheral blood adult pluripotent stem cells (PB-APSC) are reliable markers of long-term well-being that are known to decrease with age. The objective of this study is to understand the effect of our MBT program on telomerase activity and stem cells in blood collected from the participants. DESIGN: Here, we have investigated the effects of an intensive three weeks MBT retreat on telomerase activity and the peripheral blood stem cells in participants before and after the MBT. A total of 108 people were enrolled in the study; 38 men and 70 women (aged 18-90) randomly assigned for the study. RESULTS: Telomerase activity was greater in retreat participants at the end of the MBT retreat. About 45% of people showed more than one-fold increase of telomerase activity after our MBT program. Furthermore, about 27% of people showed more pronounced fold increase (2-fold) in telomerase activity after the MBT. In addition, a substantial percentage of people (about 90%) exhibited increased stem cell counts after the MBT. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest increased telomerase activity and stem cells count in peripheral blood from MBT retreat participants that may lead to increased longevity and better quality of life at latter age.

25547641	Efficacy of psychosocial interventions on psychological and physical health outcomes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Psychosocial intervention has been suggested as a potentially effective supplement to medical treatment in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but no reviews so far have quantified the existing research in terms of both psychological and physical health outcomes. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials evaluating the effects of psychosocial interventions on psychological and physical health outcomes in COPD. METHODS: Two independent raters screened 1,491 references for eligibility. Twenty independent studies investigating a total of 1,361 patients were included, assessed for their methodological quality, and subjected to meta-analytic evaluation. RESULTS: After adjusting for potential publication bias, a statistically significant overall effect was found for psychological (Hedges' g = 0.38, 95% confidence interval, CI = 0.19-0.58; p < 0.001) outcomes. When analyzing individual intervention types, cognitive behavioral therapy appeared to be effective (g = 0.39, CI = 0.15-0.62; p = 0.001) for improving psychological outcomes. In contrast, for physical outcomes, only mind-body interventions (e.g. mindfulness-based therapy, yoga, and relaxation) revealed a statistically significant effect (g = 0.40; CI = 0.01-0.79; p = 0.042). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results lend support to psychosocial intervention as a tool in the management of COPD. However, due to indications of possible publication bias towards positive findings, the results should be interpreted with some caution, and more high quality research is needed.

25542333	The effectiveness of exercise interventions for improving health-related quality of life from diagnosis through active cancer treatment.	PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of exercise interventions on overall health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and its domains among adults scheduled to, or actively undergoing, cancer treatment. DATA SOURCES: 11 electronic databases were searched through November 2011. In addition, the authors searched PubMed's related article feature, trial registries, and reference lists of included trials and related reviews. DATA SYNTHESIS: 56 trials with 4,826 participants met the inclusion criteria. At 12 weeks, people exposed to exercise interventions had greater improvement in overall HRQOL, physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning, and fatigue. Improvement in HRQOL was associated with moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise can be a useful tool for managing HRQOL and HRQOL domains for people scheduled to, or actively undergoing, cancer treatment. More methodologically rigorous trials are needed to examine the attributes of exercise programs most effective for improving HRQOL. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Evidence from this review supports the incorporation of exercise programs of moderate-to-vigorous intensity for the management of HRQOL among people scheduled to, or actively undergoing, cancer treatment into clinical guidelines through the Oncology Nursing Society's Putting Evidence Into Practice resources.

25540568	Effect of yoga therapy on physical and psychological quality of life of perimenopausal women in selected coastal areas of Karnataka, India.	BACKGROUND: Perimenopausal period is characterized by a continuous decline in ovarian function due to which women are vulnerable to various physical and psychological symptoms affecting their quality of life. Currently these symptoms are managed by hormone replacement therapy. However, hormonal therapy can cause complications including malignancy which has resulted in search for various alternative therapies to improve the quality of life (QOL). Yoga is one such alternative therapy shown to enhance the QOL at all stages of human life associated with the chronic illness. There are very few scientific studies regarding the effect of yoga on perimenopause and in this study we investigated the effects of yoga therapy on physical and psychological symptoms using the standardized questionnaire. OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of yoga therapy on physical, psychological, vasomotor and sexual symptoms of perimenopause. MATERIALS AND METHODS: It is a prospective non-randomized control study of 216 perimenopausal women with 12 weeks of intervention. The subjects were divided in two groups with either yoga therapy [n = 111] or exercise [n = 105] as the interventional tool. The symptoms control and QOL before and after intervention in both the groups were assessed by using the menopausal QOL questionnaire. RESULTS: The perimenopausal symptoms in all the four domains were improved by yoga therapy, thus significantly improving the overall QOL compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: This study clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of yoga therapy in managing the distressing perimenopausal symptoms. It is easy, safe, non-expensive alternative therapy helping the well-being of perimenopausal women and must be encouraged in the regular management of perimenopausal symptoms.

25540518	Effects of yogic exercises on life stress and blood glucose levels in nursing students.	[Purpose] This study was performed to investigate the effects of yogic exercises on life stress and blood glucose levels in nursing students. [Subjects and Methods] The study was a randomized controlled trial. Twenty-seven undergraduate nursing students were randomly selected, with 12 assigned to an exercise group and 15 assigned to a control group. The yogic exercises intervention was undertaken for 60 minutes one day a week for 12 weeks. It consisted of physical exercise (surya namaskara) combined with relaxation and meditation (shavasana and yoga nidra). Life stress was measured by the Life Stress Scale for College Students, and postprandial blood glucose levels were measured with a digital glucometer. [Results] The exercise group measurements were significantly decreased in both life stress and postprandial blood glucose levels compared with the control group. [Conclusion] These findings indicate that yogic exercises would reduce life stress and lower postprandial blood glucose levels in nursing students.	Kim, Sang Dol	2014 Dec
25539839	Integrating yoga therapy in the management of urinary incontinence: a case report.	A 63-year-old overweight female prediagnosed of stress urinary incontinence presented with exacerbated events of urine leakage. She was advised a residential lifestyle and behavioral program, primarily consisting of a monitored yoga therapy module, apart from her ongoing anticholinergic medicine, for 21 days. Assessments were based on a frequency volume chart, a bladder diary for the entire duration of treatment, and the International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form questionnaire on the days of admission and discharge. A total of 1.9 kg of weight loss was observed during her stay. Usage of pad, as reported in her diary, reduced from 3 to 1 per day. Her International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form score reduced from 16 to 9, indicating better continence. She expressed subjective well-being and confidence in her social interactions. This is probably the first case report demonstrating feasibility of integration of yoga therapy in the management of urinary incontinence.	Vinchurkar, Suhas Ashok;Arankalle, Dhananjay Vijay	2015 Apr
25538634	Reducing the symptomatology of panic disorder: the effects of a yoga program alone and in combination with cognitive-behavioral therapy.	INTRODUCTION: Yoga is a holistic system of different mind-body practices that can be used to improve mental and physical health. It has been shown to reduce perceived stress and anxiety as well as improve mood and quality of life. Research documenting the therapeutic benefits of yoga has grown progressively for the past decades and now includes controlled trials on a variety of mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and panic disorder. OBJECTIVES: The primary goal of this study was to investigate the effects of yoga in patients suffering from panic disorder. We aimed at observing the efficacy of yoga techniques on reducing the symptomatology of panic disorder (anxiety and agoraphobia), compared to a combined intervention of yoga and psychotherapy. METHOD: Twenty subjects previously diagnosed with panic disorder were selected. Subjects were randomly assigned to both experimental groups: Group 1 (G1-Yoga: 10 subjects) attended yoga classes and Group 2 (G2-CBT + Yoga: 10 subjects) participated in a combined intervention of yoga practice followed by a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) session. Both interventions occurred weekly for 100 min and lasted 2 months. Subjects were evaluated two times during the study: pre-test and post-test. Psychometric tools included the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), The Panic Beliefs Inventory (PBI), and Body Sensations Questionnaire (BSQ). RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed significant reductions in anxiety levels associated with panic disorder (G1: BAI - p = 0.035, HAM-A - p = 0.000; G2: BAI - p = 0.002, HAM-A - p = 0.000), panic-related beliefs (G1: PBI - p = 0.000; G2: PBI - p = 0.000) and panic-related body sensations (G1: BSQ - p = 0.000; G2: BSQ - p = 0.000) both in G1 and G2. However, the combination of yoga and CBT (G2) showed even further reductions in all observed parameters (mean values). CONCLUSION: This study observed significant improvement in panic symptomatology following both the practice of yoga and the combination of yoga and psychotherapy. While contemplative techniques such as yoga promote a general change in dealing with private events, CBT teaches how to modify irrational beliefs and specific cognitive distortions. The results observed in G2 might indicate that the techniques complemented each other, increasing the intervention efficacy. These findings are in agreement with many investigations found in the literature which observed improvements in different mental health parameters after the practice of contemplative techniques alone or combined to psychotherapy. Future research joining psychological and physiological variables could help better elucidate the mechanisms through which mind-body practices work to improve mental health.

25535930	Effects of yoga intervention during pregnancy: a review for current status.	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article is to review all randomized control trials (RCTs) that have looked at the health effects of yoga on pregnancy, and to present their evidence on the specific ways in which pregnant women, and their infants can benefit from yoga intervention. The purpose is also to determine whether yoga intervention during pregnancy is more beneficial than other physical exercises. METHODS: Four databases were searched using the terms "yoga and (pregnancy or pregnant or prenatal or postnatal or postpartum)." Databases were searched from January 2004 to February 2014. RESULTS: Ten randomized controlled trials were evaluated. The findings consistently indicate that yoga intervention presented with lower incidences of prenatal disorders (p </= 0.05), and small gestational age (p < 0.05), lower levels of pain and stress (p < 0.05), and higher score of relationship (p < 0.05). In addition, yoga can be safely used for pregnant women who are depressed, at high-risk, or experience lumbopelvic pain. Moreover, yoga is a more effective exercise than walking or standard prenatal exercises. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that yoga is a safe and more effective intervention during pregnancy. However, further RCTs are needed to provide firmer evidence regarding the utility and validity of yoga intervention.	Jiang, Qinxian;Wu, Zhengguo;Zhou, Li;Dunlop, Jenae;Chen, Peijie	2015 May
25525457	Isometric yoga improves the fatigue and pain of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome who are resistant to conventional therapy: a randomized, controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) often complain of persistent fatigue even after conventional therapies such as pharmacotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, or graded exercise therapy. The aim of this study was to investigate in a randomized, controlled trial the feasibility and efficacy of isometric yoga in patients with CFS who are resistant to conventional treatments. METHODS: This trial enrolled 30 patients with CFS who did not have satisfactory improvement after receiving conventional therapy for at least six months. They were randomly divided into two groups and were treated with either conventional pharmacotherapy (control group, n = 15) or conventional therapy together with isometric yoga practice that consisted of biweekly, 20-minute sessions with a yoga instructor and daily in-home sessions (yoga group, n = 15) for approximately two months. The short-term effect of isometric yoga on fatigue was assessed by administration of the Profile of Mood Status (POMS) questionnaire immediately before and after the final 20-minute session with the instructor. The long-term effect of isometric yoga on fatigue was assessed by administration of the Chalder's Fatigue Scale (FS) questionnaire to both groups before and after the intervention. Adverse events and changes in subjective symptoms were recorded for subjects in the yoga group. RESULTS: All subjects completed the intervention. The mean POMS fatigue score decreased significantly (from 21.9 +/- 7.7 to 13.8 +/- 6.7, P < 0.001) after a yoga session. The Chalder's FS score decreased significantly (from 25.9 +/- 6.1 to 19.2 +/- 7.5, P = 0.002) in the yoga group, but not in the control group. In addition to the improvement of fatigue, two patients with CFS and fibromyalgia syndrome in the yoga group also reported pain relief. Furthermore, many subjects reported that their bodies became warmer and lighter after practicing isometric yoga. Although there were no serious adverse events in the yoga group, two patients complained of tiredness and one of dizziness after the first yoga session with the instructor. CONCLUSIONS: Isometric yoga as an add-on therapy is both feasible and successful at relieving the fatigue and pain of a subset of therapy-resistant patients with CFS.

25524471	Yoga, as a transitional platform to more active lifestyle: a 6-month pilot study in the USA.	A 6-month pilot study explored the effects of a yoga program on the physical activity (PA) level of overweight or obese sedentary adults. Fourteen community-dwelling overweight or obese sedentary adults participated in a 6-month program (2-month yoga program and 4-month follow-up) delivered by two types of instruction [the direct guidance of an instructor (face-to-face group) vs. the self-learning method of using a DVD (DVD group)]. Measurements included program adherence (class attendance and home practice; min/week) and level of PA [metabolic equivalent (MET)-hour/week] at baseline, 2, 4 and 6 months. Descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests were used to describe the sample and examine differences by group and time. There were no significant differences in demographic variables by group assigned. Participants showed significant PA changes from baseline to each measurement point. The direct guidance of an instructor was preferred over the self-learning method. At each time interval, the DVD group showed higher levels of PA than the face-to-face group; the only difference that achieved statistical significance occurred at 4 months. The PA level significantly changed over 6 months in the DVD group, but not in the face-to-face group. The results indicate that a yoga program may be utilized as a 'stepping-stone' toward regular exercise among overweight sedentary adults. Research with a larger sample is needed to further evaluate the effects of the program on the level of PA among this population.	Yang, Kyeongra;James, Khara A	2016 Jun
25523786	Characterization of the cell growth analysis for detection of immortal cellular impurities in human mesenchymal stem cells.	The analysis of in vitro cell senescence/growth after serial passaging can be one of ways to show the absence of immortalized cells, which are frequently tumorigenic, in human cell-processed therapeutic products (hCTPs). However, the performance of the cell growth analysis for detection of the immortalized cellular impurities has never been evaluated. In the present study, we examined the growth rates of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs, passage 5 (P = 5)) contaminated with various doses of HeLa cells, and compared with that of hMSCs alone. The growth rates of the contaminated hMSCs were comparable to that of hMSCs alone at P = 5, but significantly increased at P = 6 (0.1% and 0.01% HeLa) or P = 7 (0.001% HeLa) within 30 days. These findings suggest that the cell growth analysis is a simple and sensitive method to detect immortalized cellular impurities in hCTPs derived from human somatic cells.

25519914	A pilot study of a mindfulness based stress reduction program in adolescents with implantable cardioverter defibrillators or pacemakers.	Adolescents with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) or pacemakers (PMs) face unique challenges that can cause psychosocial distress. Psychosocial interventions are effective for adults with cardiac devices and could potentially impact adolescents' adjustment to these devices. Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a structured psycho-educational program that includes meditation, yoga, and group support and has been studied extensively among adults. This study examined the feasibility of the MBSR program for adolescents with ICDs/PMs, a population previously unexamined in the research literature. The participants completed measures of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and coping (Responses to Stress Questionnaire) at baseline and after the six-session MBSR intervention. Mean age of the cohort (n = 10) was 15 +/- 3 years, 6 were male, 6 had a PM, and 4 had an ICD. Feasibility was demonstrated by successful recruitment of 10 participants, 100 % participation and completion. Anxiety decreased significantly following the intervention, with a large effect size, t[9] = 3.67, p < .01, eng (2) = .59. Anxiety frequency decreased from baseline to post-intervention (Fisher's exact test p = .024), and 90 % of participants reported decreased anxiety scores post-intervention. Coping skills related negatively to anxiety (r = -.65, p = .04) and depression (r = -.88, p = .001). Post-intervention, the group independently formed their own Facebook group and requested to continue meeting monthly. Although generalizability is limited due to the small sample size, this successful pilot study paves the way for larger studies to examine the efficacy of MBSR interventions in adolescents with high-risk cardiac diagnoses.

25514685	Yoga as an alternative intervention for promoting a healthy lifestyle among college students.	Substance use and abuse continues to plague U.S. college campuses. The literature is replete with information from various disciplines on how to identify and intervene in this public health dilemma impacting college students. Identifications, treatments, and interventions are often based on Western medicine, but there is a growing movement and evidence supporting the effectiveness, value, and usefulness of Eastern therapies to combat this problem. Yoga is one Eastern intervention that has proven beneficial for promoting quality of life and wellness relationship to several acute and chronic illnesses. As a result of advocating for the inclusion of yoga in traditional college settings, two college campuses in Central Illinois introduced yoga courses for students, faculty, and staff. The courses are reviewed, and the positive results reported by students are shared. The information and evidence of yoga's benefits collected in this study warrant consideration by college campuses to initiate this practice enhancing primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention in their populations.

25510863	The effectiveness of yoga in modifying risk factors for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.	BACKGROUND: Yoga, a popular mind-body practice, may produce changes in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic syndrome risk factors. DESIGN: This was a systematic review and random-effects meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: Electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were performed for systematic reviews and RCTs through December 2013. Studies were included if they were English, peer-reviewed, focused on asana-based yoga in adults, and reported relevant outcomes. Two reviewers independently selected articles and assessed quality using Cochrane's Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS: Out of 1404 records, 37 RCTs were included in the systematic review and 32 in the meta-analysis. Compared to non-exercise controls, yoga showed significant improvement for body mass index (-0.77 kg/m(2) (95% confidence interval -1.09 to -0.44)), systolic blood pressure (-5.21 mmHg (-8.01 to -2.42)), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-12.14 mg/dl (-21.80 to -2.48)), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (3.20 mg/dl (1.86 to 4.54)). Significant changes were seen in body weight (-2.32 kg (-4.33 to -0.37)), diastolic blood pressure (-4.98 mmHg (-7.17 to -2.80)), total cholesterol (-18.48 mg/dl (-29.16 to -7.80)), triglycerides (-25.89 mg/dl (-36.19 to -15.60), and heart rate (-5.27 beats/min (-9.55 to -1.00)), but not fasting blood glucose (-5.91 mg/dl (-16.32 to 4.50)) nor glycosylated hemoglobin (-0.06% Hb (-0.24 to 0.11)). No significant difference was found between yoga and exercise. One study found an impact on smoking abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: There is promising evidence of yoga on improving cardio-metabolic health. Findings are limited by small trial sample sizes, heterogeneity, and moderate quality of RCTs.	Chu, Paula;Gotink, Rinske A;Yeh, Gloria Y;Goldie, Sue J;Hunink, M G Myriam	2016 Feb
25509967	Effect of rajyoga meditation on chronic tension headache.	Chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) is the most common type of headache with no truly effective treatment. This study was designed to correlate the additive effect of meditation on CTTH patients receiving medical treatment. 50 patients (aged 18-58 years) presenting with a clinical diagnosis of CCTH, were divided in 2 groups. Group 1 (n=30) received 8 lessons and practical demonstration of Brahmakumaris spiritual based meditation known as Rajyoga meditation for relaxation therapy, in addition to routine medical treatment (analgesics and muscle relaxants). Group 2 (n=20) patients received analgesics and muscle relaxants twice a day but no relaxation therapy in the form of meditation. Both groups were followed up for 8 weeks period. The parameters studied were severity, frequency and duration of CCTH, and their headache index calculated. Patients in both groups showed a highly significant reduction in headache variables (P<0.001) after 8 weeks. But the percentage of patients showing highly significant relief in severity of headache, duration & frequency in Group 1 was 94%, 91% and 97% respectively whereas in Group 2 it was 36%, 36% and 49% respectively. Headache relief as calculated by headache index was 99% in Group 1 as compared to 51% in Group 2. Even Short term spiritual based relaxation therapy (Rajyoga meditation) was highly effective in causing earlier relief in chronic tension headache as measured by headache parameter.

25464684	Role of yoga in modifying anxiety level in women.	Anxiety leads to derangement in physical and mental health. Anxiety levels are more in full time housewives than working women. There is a need for simple, easy treatment for anxiety to alleviate the burden on health caused by anxiety. Yoga is among the top ten complementary and alternative medicine therapies. Our study aimed to determine the anxiety levels in apparently healthy full time housewives and to study the effects of Yoga on anxiety levels among them. Present study is a comparative interventional study. Study was conducted on 50 apparently healthy full time housewives (20-50 years) who attended one month Yoga camp. Hamilton Anxiety (HAMA) Scale was used to evaluate anxiety levels before and at the end of the yoga camp. Statistical analysis was done by Paired t test using SPSS 9.0. The baseline pulse rate, SBP, DBP were 82.90 +/- 4.25 bpm, 124.84 +/- 11.022 mm Hg, 85.20 +/- 10.81 mm Hg respectively. After four weeks yoga camp there was statistically significant lowering of pulse rate (77.58 +/- 3.86 bpm), SBP (117.92 +/- 6.76 mm Hg), DBP (78.68 +/- 6.62 mm Hg). Before yoga training, percentage distributions of subjects with mild, moderate and severe anxiety were 6%, 18% and 76% respectively. At the end of four week yoga training, percentage distributions of subjects with mild, moderate and severe anxiety were 44.23%, 19.23% and 36.53% respectively. There was highly significant (p = 0.000) difference in the mean values of total score before (33.71 +/- 4.90) and after (26.93 +/- 4.53) yoga. These results indicate that there was a reduction in the severity of anxiety from severe to moderate and mild indicating decrease in anxiety following yoga. Based on the results of our study, we conclude that regular yogic practices and adapting and implementing the principals and philosophy of yoga in day to day life may decrease the anxiety level.

25464679	Effects of yoga training and detraining on physical performance measures in prepubertal children--a randomized trial.	Purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of yoga training and detraining on physical performance measures in pre-pubertal (7-9 year old) school going children. Subjects were randomized to two groups - yoga group and Physical exercise (PE) group after the baseline assessment. All the subjects were assessed for strength, endurance, whole body endurance through 20 meter shuttle and physical fitness, at 3 time points - Baseline, 3 months Post intervention and 3 months after detraining. The results suggest that the improvement in the physical performance is largely by the increase in the respiratory muscle strength in the yoga group. In conclusion, the study presents the efficacy of yoga to improve strength, endurance, whole body endurance and aerobic capacity with 3 months of training in the pediatric group. However, the effect of the training does not last after 3 months detraining.	D'souza, Crystal;Avadhany, Sandhya T	2014 Jan-Mar
25464673	Immediate changes in muscle strength and motor speed following yoga breathing.	The present study was conducted to assess the immediate effect of high-frequency yoga breathing on muscle strength and motor speed. Bilateral handgrip strength, leg and back strength, finger tapping and arm tapping speed were assessed in fifty male participants (group mean age +/- SD, 26.9 +/- 6.2 years) before and after (a) high frequency yoga breathing for 15 minutes and (b) breath awareness for the same duration. Sessions (a) and (b) were on two different days but at the same time of the day. The schedule was alternated for different participants. There was a significant increase (P < 0.05) in right hand grip strength after high frequency yoga breathing. Both finger and arm tapping improved after both practices. The results suggest a role for high frequency yoga breathing in improving the hand grip strength as an immediate effect.

25457687	Potential long-term effects of a mind-body intervention for women with major depressive disorder: sustained mental health improvements with a pilot yoga intervention.	Despite pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic advances over the past decades, many individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) experience recurrent depressive episodes and persistent depressive symptoms despite treatment with the usual care. Yoga is a mind-body therapeutic modality that has received attention in both the lay and research literature as a possible adjunctive therapy for depression. Although promising, recent findings about the positive mental health effects of yoga are limited because few studies have used standardized outcome measures and none of them have involved long-term follow-up beyond a few months after the intervention period. The goal of our research study was to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effects of a yoga intervention for women with MDD using standardized outcome measures and a long follow-up period (1year after the intervention). The key finding is that previous yoga practice has long-term positive effects, as revealed in both qualitative reports of participants' experiences and in the quantitative data about depression and rumination scores over time. Although generalizability of the study findings is limited because of a very small sample size at the 1-year follow-up assessment, the trends in the data suggest that exposure to yoga may convey a sustained positive effect on depression, ruminations, stress, anxiety, and health-related quality of life. Whether an individual continues with yoga practice, simple exposure to a yoga intervention appears to provide sustained benefits to the individual. This is important because it is rare that any intervention, pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic, for depression conveys such sustained effects for individuals with MDD, particularly after the treatment is discontinued.

25457355	Application of an integrative yoga therapy programme in cases of essential arterial hypertension in public healthcare.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of an integrative yoga programme as adjuvant treatment of essential arterial hypertension. METHODS: An Integrative yoga programme was conducted during three months in 26 sessions with a group of ten essential arterial hypertension patients at a public health centre. The same number of patients acted as the control group without treatment. The patients were randomly selected and assigned to the groups. All patients filled in the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Smith Relaxation States Inventory 3 (SRSI3) before and after the treatment. RESULTS: A statistically significant reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, negative affect, symptoms of anxiety and degree of stress could be observed in the study group. CONCLUSIONS: These positive and promising results confirm the effectiveness of these techniques in the treatment of essential arterial hypertension and suggest possible further investigations.

25453519	Yoga leads to multiple physical improvements after stroke, a pilot study.	OBJECTIVE: To assess change in physical functioning (pain, range of motion (ROM), strength, and endurance) after 8 weeks of therapeutic-yoga. DESIGN: Planned analyses of data from a randomized pilot study of yoga after stroke. SETTING: University-based research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: People with chronic stroke (N=47) randomized to therapeutic-yoga (n=37) or wait-list control (n=10). INTERVENTIONS: 16 sessions of therapeutic yoga (twice a week/8 weeks). Yoga was delivered in a standardized and progressive format with postures, breathing, and meditation, and relaxation in sitting, standing, and supine. MAIN MEASURES: Pain was assessed with the PEG, a 3-item functional measure of the interference of pain. ROM included neck and hip active and passive ROM measurements). Upper and lower extremity strength were assessed with the arm curl test and chair-to-stand test, respectively. Endurance was assessed with the 6-minute walk and modified 2-min step test. RESULTS: After a Bonferroni Correction, pain, neck ROM, hip passive ROM, upper extremity strength, and the 6-min walk scores all significantly improved after 8 weeks of engaging in yoga. No changes occurred in the wait-list control group. CONCLUSIONS: A group therapeutic-yoga intervention may improve multiple aspects of physical functioning after stroke. Such an intervention may be complementary to traditional rehabilitation.	Schmid, Arlene A;Miller, Kristine K;Van Puymbroeck, Marieke;DeBaun-Sprague, Erin	2014 Dec
25449185	Effects of yoga on cancer-related fatigue and global side-effect burden in older cancer survivors.	BACKGROUND: Sixty percent of cancer survivors are 65years of age or older. Cancer and its treatments lead to cancer-related fatigue and many other side effects, in turn, creating substantial global side-effect burden (total burden from all side effects) which, ultimately, compromises functional independence and quality of life. Various modes of exercise, such as yoga, reduce cancer-related fatigue and global side-effect burden in younger cancer survivors, but no studies have specifically examined the effects of yoga on older cancer survivors. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of a 4-week yoga intervention (Yoga for Cancer Survivors: YOCAS(c)(R)) on overall cancer-related fatigue, and due to its multidimensional nature, the subdomains of cancer-related fatigue (general, physical, emotional, and mental) and global side-effect burden in older cancer survivors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis on data from a multicenter phase III randomized controlled clinical trial with 2 arms (standard care and standard care plus a 4-week YOCAS(c)(R) intervention). The sample for this secondary analysis was 97 older cancer survivors (>/=60years of age), between 2months and 2years post-treatment, who participated in the original trial. RESULTS: Participants in the YOCAS(c)(R) intervention arm reported significantly lower cancer-related fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, and global side-effect burden than participants in the standard care arm following the 4-week intervention period (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: YOCAS(c)(R) is an effective standardized yoga intervention for reducing cancer-related fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, and global side-effect burden among older cancer survivors.

25443601	Yoga based cardiac rehabilitation after coronary artery bypass surgery: one-year results on LVEF, lipid profile and psychological states--a randomized controlled study.	OBJECTIVE: To compare the long term effects of yoga based cardiac rehabilitation program with only physiotherapy based program as an add-on to conventional rehabilitation after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on risk factors. METHODS: In this single blind prospective randomized parallel two armed active control study, 1026 patients posted for CABG at Narayana Hrudayalaya Institute of Cardiac Sciences, Bengaluru (India) were screened. Of these, 250 male participants (35-65 years) who satisfied the selection criteria and consented were randomized into two groups. Within and between group comparisons were done at three points of follow up (i.e. 6th week, 6th month, and 12th month) by using Wilcoxon's signed ranks test and Mann Whitney U test respectively. RESULTS: Yoga group had significantly (p = 0.001, Mann Whitney) better improvement in LVEF than control group in those with abnormal baseline EF (<53%) after 1 year. There was a better reduction in BMI in the yoga group (p = 0.038, between groups) in those with high baseline BMI (>/=23) after 12 months. Yoga group showed significant (p = 0.008, Wilcoxon's) reduction in blood glucose at one year in those with high baseline FBS >/=110 mg/dl. There was significantly better improvement in yoga than the control group in HDL (p = 0.003), LDL (p = 0.01) and VLDL (p = 0.03) in those with abnormal baseline values. There was significantly better improvement (p = 0.02, between groups) in positive affect in yoga group. Within Yoga group, there was significant decrease in perceived stress (p = 0.001), anxiety (p = 0.001), depression (p = 0.001), and negative affect (p = 0.03) while in the control group there was reduction (p = 0.003) only in scores on anxiety. CONCLUSION: Addition of yoga based relaxation to conventional post-CABG cardiac rehabilitation helps in better management of risk factors in those with abnormal baseline values and may help in preventing recurrence.

25440560	Effect of Sudarshan Kriya on male prisoners with non psychotic psychiatric disorders: a randomized control trial.	OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether Sudarshan Kriya and related practices (SK&P) can lead to increased global assessment of functioning (GAF) and increased feeling of wellness in male prisoners with a non psychotic psychiatric disorder. METHODOLOGY: This is a six month parallel randomized controlled study with sample size of 230 male prisoners. Participants meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria were assigned to a study or control group by simple random allocation in which random allocation sequence was generated using a random number table. Each individual study participant was involved in a daily program of SK&P for six weeks. Each individual control participant was instructed to sit in an armchair with his eyes closed and gentle attention to their breath for duration of six weeks. To be included in this study, a participant must be a male prisoner diagnosed to be suffering from a psychiatric disorder (except psychosis and bipolar affective disorder [BPAD]) by ICD-10 (DCR) criteria with age between 18 and 65 years. RESULTS: Majority of subjects were unemployed married individuals, educated until undermatric level and not having occupational skills of more than an unskilled labor level. Practicing SK&P for six weeks led to improvement in mean+/-SD score of study participants in GAF, anxiety (ANX), depressed mood (DEP), positive well being (PWB), general health (GH), self control (SC), vitality (VT) and total positive general well being (PGWB). Change in mean+/-SD score of study participants when compared with control participants was statistically significant in terms of GAF, ANX, DEP, PWB, GH and PGWB. Increase in SC and VT scores was statistically insignificant when compared with control participants. CONCLUSION: Practicing SK&P helps in improving GAF, PWB, GH and total PGWB of an individual. SK&P also causes significant reduction in anxiety and depression levels. Effect of SK&P on SC and VT is insignificant.

25440384	Comparison groups in yoga research: a systematic review and critical evaluation of the literature.	OBJECTIVES: Comparison groups are essential for accurate testing and interpretation of yoga intervention trials. However, selecting proper comparison groups is difficult because yoga comprises a very heterogeneous set of practices and its mechanisms of effect have not been conclusively established. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the control and comparison groups used in published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of yoga. RESULTS: We located 128 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria; of these, 65 included only a passive control and 63 included at least one active comparison group. Primary comparison groups were physical exercise (43%), relaxation/meditation (20%), and education (16%). Studies rarely provided a strong rationale for choice of comparison. Considering year of publication, the use of active controls in yoga research appears to be slowly increasing over time. CONCLUSIONS: Given that yoga has been established as a potentially powerful intervention, future research should use active control groups. Further, care is needed to select comparison conditions that help to isolate the specific mechanisms of yoga's effects.

25440383	Components and reporting of yoga interventions for musculoskeletal conditions: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials.	OBJECTIVES: To identify the content and reporting details of randomised controlled trials of yoga for musculoskeletal conditions through a systematic review of the literature. DESIGN: Twenty electronic databases were searched to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of yoga interventions for musculoskeletal conditions. Eligibility criteria were full-text, peer reviewed articles, of RCTs with yoga as a primary intervention, on a population aged 18 years and over, with a clinical diagnosis of a musculoskeletal condition. Data relating to study characteristics, yoga styles, yoga practices, home practice, and reporting were extracted and summarised. RESULTS: Seventeen articles met inclusion criteria, representing five musculoskeletal conditions: low back pain, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, kyphosis, and fibromyalgia. 15 studies were non-residential, and two were residential. Study duration ranged from 1 to 24 weeks; weekly dosage of yoga ranged from 1 to 56h. Five styles of posture-based Hatha yoga were specified. Intervention content included seven yoga practises: postures, breathing, relaxation, meditation, philosophy, chanting, and cleansing practises. Ten studies either encouraged or requested home practice. Reporting details included class plans, posture lists, and diagrams. Due to insufficient detail regarding delivery of the yoga intervention only eight of the 17 interventions were considered replicable as reported. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of study characteristics and yoga components indicated several areas of homogeneity across studies, suggesting an existing degree of standardisation. However, heterogeneity related to intervention content and reporting impeded determination of intervention content and delivery. Standardisation of content, nomenclature, and reporting details is recommended to enhance protocol transparency, replication, and comparison of intervention effectiveness.

25440207	Effects of yoga on arm volume among women with breast cancer related lymphedema: A pilot study.	Lymphedema affects 3-58% of survivors of breast cancer and can result in upper extremity impairments. Exercise can be beneficial in managing lymphedema. Yoga practice has been minimally studied for its effects on breast cancer related lymphedema (BCRL). The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of yoga on arm volume, quality of life (QOL), self-reported arm function, and hand grip strength in women with BCRL. Six women with BCRL participated in modified Hatha yoga 3x/week for 8 weeks. Compression sleeves were worn during yoga sessions. Arm volume, QOL, self-reported arm function, and hand grip strength were measured at baseline, half-way, and at the conclusion of yoga practice. Arm volume significantly decreased from baseline (2423.3 ml +/- 597.2) to final measures (2370.8 ml +/- 577.2) (p = .02). No significant changes in QOL (p = .12), self-reported arm function (p = .34), or hand grip strength (p = .26) were found. Yoga may be beneficial in the management of lymphedema.

25432802	Physical activity and depressive symptoms after stillbirth: informing future interventions.	BACKGROUND: In the United States, approximately one in 110 pregnancies end in stillbirth affecting more than 26,000 women annually. Women experiencing stillbirth have a threefold greater risk of developing depressive symptoms compared to women experiencing live birth. Depression contributes negatively to health outcomes for both mothers and babies subsequent to stillbirth. Physical activity may improve depression in these women, however, little is known about acceptable physical activity interventions for women after stillbirth. This is the purpose of this descriptive exploratory study. METHODS: Eligible women were between ages 19 and 45, and experienced stillbirth within one year of the study. An online survey was used to ask questions related to 1) pregnancy and family information (i.e., time since stillbirth, weight gain during pregnancy, number of other children) 2) physical activity participation, 3) depressive symptomatology, and 4) demographics. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-five women participated in the study (M age = 31.26 +/- 5.52). Women reported participating in regular physical activity (at least 150 minutes of moderate activity weekly) before (60%) and during (47%) their pregnancy, as well as after their stillbirth (61%). Only 37% were currently meeting physical activity recommendations. Approximately 88% reported depression (i.e., score of >10 on depression scale). When asked how women cope with depression, anxiety, or grief, 38% said physical activity. Of those that reported using physical activity to cope after stillbirth, they did so to help with depression (58%), weight loss (55%), and better overall physical health (52%). To cope with stillbirth, women used walking (67%), followed by jogging (35%), and yoga (23%). Women who participated in physical activity after stillbirth reported significantly lower depressive symptoms (M = 15.10, SD = 5.32) compared to women who did not participate in physical activity (M = 18.06, SD = 5.57; t = -3.45, p = .001). CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity may serve as a unique opportunity to help women cope with the multiple mental sequelae after stillbirth. This study provides data to inform healthcare providers about the potential role of physical activity in bereavement and recovery for women who have experienced stillbirth. Additional research is necessary in this vulnerable population.	Huberty, Jennifer;Leiferman, Jenn A;Gold, Katherine J;Rowedder, Lacey;Cacciatore, Joanne;McClain, Darya Bonds	2014 Nov 29
25432478	Rehabilitation practice patterns for patients with heart failure: the Asian perspective.	More countries around world have begun to use cardiac rehabilitation in patients diagnosed with chronic heart failure (HF). Asia is the largest continent in the world and, depending on its economy, culture, and beliefs, a given Asian country differs from Western countries as well as others in Asia. The cardiac rehabilitation practice patterns for patients with HF are somewhat different in Asia. In addition to the formal pattern of Western practice, it also includes special techniques and skills, such as Taiji, Qigong, and Yoga. This article describes cardiac rehabilitation patterns for patients with HF in most Asian countries and areas.	Sun, Xing-Guo	2015 Jan
25432016	Exercise for reducing fear of falling in older people living in the community.	BACKGROUND: Fear of falling is common in older people and associated with serious physical and psychosocial consequences. Exercise (planned, structured, repetitive and purposive physical activity aimed at improving physical fitness) may reduce fear of falling by improving strength, gait, balance and mood, and reducing the occurrence of falls. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects (benefits, harms and costs) of exercise interventions for reducing fear of falling in older people living in the community. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (July 2013), the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2013, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1946 to July Week 3 2013), EMBASE (1980 to 2013 Week 30), CINAHL (1982 to July 2013), PsycINFO (1967 to August 2013), AMED (1985 to August 2013), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (accessed 7 August 2013) and Current Controlled Trials (accessed 7 August 2013). We applied no language restrictions. We handsearched reference lists and consulted experts. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised and quasi-randomised trials that recruited community-dwelling people (where the majority were aged 65 and over) and were not restricted to specific medical conditions (e.g. stroke, hip fracture). We included trials that evaluated exercise interventions compared with no intervention or a non-exercise intervention (e.g. social visits), and that measured fear of falling. Exercise interventions were varied; for example, they could be 'prescriptions' or recommendations, group-based or individual, supervised or unsupervised. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Pairs of review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias in the studies and extracted data. We combined effect sizes across studies using the fixed-effect model, with the random-effect model used where significant statistical heterogeneity was present. We estimated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and incidence rate ratios (IRR) for rate outcomes. We estimated mean differences (MD) where studies used the same continuous measures and standardised mean differences (SMD) where different measures or different formats of the same measure were used. Where possible, we performed various, usually prespecified, sensitivity and subgroup analyses. MAIN RESULTS: We included 30 studies, which evaluated 3D exercise (Tai Chi and yoga), balance training or strength and resistance training. Two of these were cluster-randomised trials, two were cross-over trials and one was quasi-randomised. The studies included a total of 2878 participants with a mean age ranging from 68 to 85 years. Most studies included more women than men, with four studies recruiting women only. Twelve studies recruited participants at increased risk of falls; three of these recruited participants who also had fear of falling.Poor reporting of the allocation methods in the trials made it difficult to assess the risk of selection bias in most studies. All of the studies were at high risk of performance and detection biases as there was no blinding of participants and outcome assessors and the outcomes were self reported. Twelve studies were at high risk of attrition bias. Using GRADE criteria, we judged the quality of evidence to be 'low' for fear of falling immediately post intervention and 'very low' for fear of falling at short or long-term follow-up and all other outcomes.Exercise interventions were associated with a small to moderate reduction in fear of falling immediately post intervention (SMD 0.37 favouring exercise, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.56; 24 studies; 1692 participants, low quality evidence). Pooled effect sizes did not differ significantly between the different scales used to measure fear of falling. Although none of the sensitivity analyses changed the direction of effect, the greatest reduction in the size of the effect was on removal of an extreme outlier study with 73 participants (SMD 0.24 favouring exercise, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.36). None of our subgroup analyses provided robust evidence of differences in effect in terms of either the study primary aim (reduction of fear of falling or other aim), the study population (recruitment on the basis of increased falls risk or not), the characteristics of the study exercise intervention or the study control intervention (no treatment or alternative intervention). However, there was some weak evidence of a smaller effect, which included no reduction, of exercise when compared with an alternative control.There was very low quality evidence that exercise interventions may be associated with a small reduction in fear of falling up to six months post intervention (SMD 0.17, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.38; four studies, 356 participants) and more than six months post intervention (SMD 0.20, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.41; three studies, 386 participants).Very low quality evidence suggests exercise interventions in these studies that also reported on fear of falling reduced the risk of falling measured either as participants incurring at least one fall during follow-up or the number of falls during follow-up. Very low quality evidence from four studies indicated that exercise interventions did not appear to reduce symptoms of depression or increase physical activity. The only study reporting the effects of exercise interventions on anxiety found no difference between groups. No studies reported the effects of exercise interventions on activity avoidance or costs. It is important to remember that our included studies do not represent the totality of the evidence of the effect of exercise interventions on falls, depression, anxiety or physical activity as our review only includes studies that reported fear of falling. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Exercise interventions in community-dwelling older people probably reduce fear of falling to a limited extent immediately after the intervention, without increasing the risk or frequency of falls. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether exercise interventions reduce fear of falling beyond the end of the intervention or their effect on other outcomes. Although further evidence from well-designed randomised trials is required, priority should be given to establishing a core set of outcomes that includes fear of falling for all trials examining the effects of exercise interventions in older people living in the community.

25431132	Exercise for vasomotor menopausal symptoms.	BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that many perimenopausal and early postmenopausal women will experience menopausal symptoms; hot flushes are the most common. Symptoms caused by fluctuating levels of oestrogen may be alleviated by hormone therapy (HT), but a marked global decline in its use has resulted from concerns about the risks and benefits of HT. Consequently, many women are seeking alternatives. As large numbers of women are choosing not to take HT, it is increasingly important to identify evidence-based lifestyle modifications that have the potential to reduce vasomotor menopausal symptoms. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effectiveness of any type of exercise intervention in the management of vasomotor symptoms in symptomatic perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. SEARCH METHODS: Searches of the following electronic bibliographic databases were performed to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs): Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Wiley Internet interface), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), the Science Citation Index and the Social Science Citation Index (Web of Science), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (Ovid) and SPORTDiscus. Searches include findings up to 3 March 2014. SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs in which any type of exercise intervention was compared with no treatment/control or other treatments in the management of menopausal vasomotor symptoms in symptomatic perimenopausal/postmenopausal women. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Five studies were deemed eligible for inclusion. Two review authors independently selected the studies, and three review authors independently extracted the data. The primary review outcome was vasomotor symptoms, defined as hot flushes and/or night sweats. We combined data to calculate standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) statistic. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for main comparisons using GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods. MAIN RESULTS: We included five RCTs (733 women) comparing exercise with no active treatment, exercise with yoga and exercise with HT. The evidence was of low quality: Limitations in study design were noted, along with inconsistency and imprecision. In the comparison of exercise versus no active treatment (three studies, n = 454 women), no evidence was found of a difference between groups in frequency or intensity of vasomotor symptoms (SMD -0.10, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.13, three RCTs, 454 women, I(2) = 30%, low-quality evidence). Nor was any evidence found of a difference between groups in the frequency or intensity of vasomotor symptoms when exercise was compared with yoga (SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.45 to 0.38, two studies, n = 279 women, I(2) = 61%, low-quality evidence). It was not possible to include one of the trials in the meta-analyses; this trial compared three groups: exercise plus soy milk, soy milk only and control; results favoured exercise relative to the comparators, but study numbers were small. One trial compared exercise with HT, and the HT group reported significantly fewer flushes in 24 hours than the exercise group (mean difference 5.8, 95% CI 3.17 to 8.43, 14 participants). None of the trials found evidence of a difference between groups with respect to adverse effects, but data were very scanty. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence was insufficient to show whether exercise is an effective treatment for vasomotor menopausal symptoms. One small study suggested that HT is more effective than exercise. Evidence was insufficient to show the relative effectiveness of exercise when compared with HT or yoga.

25427608	Putting evidence into practice: an update of evidence-based interventions for cancer-related fatigue during and following treatment.	Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) has deleterious effects on physical, social, cognitive, and vocational functioning, and causes emotional and spiritual distress for patients and their families; however, it remains under-recognized and undertreated. This article critically reviews and integrates the available empirical evidence supporting the efficacy of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment approaches to CRF, highlighting new evidence since 2007 and 2009 Putting Evidence Into Practice publications. Interventions that are recommended for practice or likely to be effective in improving fatigue outcomes include exercise; screening for treatable risk factors; management of concurrent symptoms; yoga; structured rehabilitation; Wisconsin ginseng; cognitive-behavioral therapies for insomnia, pain, and depression; mindfulness-based stress reduction; and psychoeducational interventions such as anticipatory guidance, psychosocial support, and energy conservation and activity management. This information can be applied to improve the management of CRF, inform health policy and program development, shape the design of clinical trials of new therapies for CRF, and drive basic and translational research.

25422589	Complementary health approach to quality of life in menopausal women: a community-based interventional study.	BACKGROUND: Menopause is the stage when the menstrual period permanently stops, and is a part of every woman's life. It usually occurs between the ages of 40 and 60 years, and is associated with hormonal, physical, and psychological changes. Estrogen and progesterone levels play the biggest part in menopause. In this stage, the ovaries make less estrogen and progesterone. When the body produces less of these hormones, the parts of the body that depend on estrogen to keep them healthy will react and this often causes discomfort for women. This study tested the impact of a complementary health approach to quality of life in menopausal women. METHODS: A community-based interventional study was conducted in selected areas in Kattankulathur Block, Kanchipuram District, Tamil Nadu, India. A simple random sampling technique was used to select menopausal women for the study. Of 260 menopausal women identified, 130 were allocated to a study group and 130 to a control group. The study group underwent yoga training for 1.5 hours per day on 5 consecutive days. After the 5-day intensive yoga training program, the menopausal women practiced yoga daily at home for 35-40 minutes a day. Along with daily yoga practice, they underwent group yoga practice for 2 days a week under the supervision of one of the investigators until 18 weeks. The yoga training program consisted of Yogasanas, Pranayama (breathing exercises), and meditation. The standardized World Health Organization QoL BREF scale was used to assess the women's quality of life. We distributed an instruction manual on steps of selected yoga practice for the women's self-reference at home after the 5 days of continuous yoga practice. A yoga practice diary was used to confirm regular performance of yoga. The women in the control group did not participate in the yoga program; however, on completion of the study, these women received intensive yoga training for 5 days. RESULTS: There was an extremely high statistically significant difference (P=0.001) between the study group and the control group with regard to the physical, psychological, social, and environmental domains of quality of life after 6, 12, and 18 weeks of yoga therapy. The mean gain score was high in all the domains of quality of life in the study group at weeks 6, 12, and 18. The overall mean gain score in the study group was 31.58 versus 1.61 in the control group. The overall mean gain score difference was 29.97 in all domains of quality of life between the study group and the control group. In the study group, the physical, psychological, social, and environmental domains of quality of life were greatly improved by practicing yoga for 18 weeks. No adverse events were reported by the women after yoga practice. CONCLUSION: Quality of life in menopausal women was greatly improved after 18 weeks of yoga practice. Women who regularly practice yoga find that they are able to enjoy menopause and experience the freedom, liberation, and energy that it brings. We conclude that yoga is an effective complementary health approach for improving quality of life in menopausal women.	Jayabharathi, Baskaran;Judie, Arulappan	2014
25416306	Effects of controlled breathing exercises and respiratory muscle training in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: results from evaluating the quality of evidence in systematic reviews.	BACKGROUND: This paper reviews evidence and quality of Systematic Reviews (SRs) on the effects of breathing control exercises (BCEs) and respiratory muscle training (RMT) on breathlessness/dyspnea and other symptoms, and quality of life (QOL) for individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: A search for BCE and RMT literature in COPD published between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2013 was performed in the following databases: PubMed, Ovid, CINAHL, PsycINFO, AMED, Cochrane and PEDro. The AMSTAR criteria were used to evaluate quality. RESULTS: After reviewing 642 reports, seven SRs were identified on RMT and BCEs. Three SRs were of high quality, three were of moderate quality, and one was of low quality. Two high-quality SRs reported significantly beneficial effects of RMT on dyspnea, and one reported significant effects on disease-specific QOL and fatigue. In these SRs, pooled data analyses were performed with three to fourteen single randomised control trials (RCTs) included in the analysis. In one of the SRs the quality of the single RCTs were rated by the authors to be between 5-7 (with10 best) and in the other one the quality of the single RCTs were rated to be between 30-83% of the maximum score.One high-quality SR found a significant positive effect of BCE based on pooled data analysis with two single RCTs in regard to pursed-lip breathing (PLB) on breathlessness. In this SR, one single RCT on diaphragmatic breathing (DB) and another one on yoga breathing (YB) showed effect on disease-specific QOL. The single RCTs included in the SR were rated by the authors in the SRs to be of low and moderate quality. CONCLUSIONS: Based on three high-quality SRs performing pooled data analyses, there is evidence that RMT has effect on breathlessness, fatigue and disease-specific QOL and PLB on breathlessness. There is also evidence that single studies on DB and YB has effect on disease-specific QOL. Few RCTs are available and the variable quality of the single RCTs in the SRs, seem to require more RCTs in particular for BCEs, but also RMT before conclusions regarding effects and high quality SRs can be written.

25412616	Effects of a classroom-based yoga intervention on cortisol and behavior in second- and third-grade students: a pilot study.	This uncontrolled pilot study examined the effects of a classroom-based yoga intervention on cortisol concentrations and perceived behavior in children. A 10-week Yoga 4 Classrooms intervention was implemented in one second-grade and one third-grade classroom. Students' salivary cortisol responses were assessed at 3 time points. Classroom teachers also documented their perceptions of the effects of the intervention on students' cognitive, social, and emotional skills. Second, but not third, graders showed a significant decrease in baseline cortisol from before to after the intervention. Second and third graders both showed significant decreases in cortisol from before to after a cognitive task, but neither grade showed additional decreases from before to after a single yoga class. The second-grade teacher perceived significant improvements in several aspects his/her students' behavior. The third-grade teacher perceived some, but fewer, improvements in his/her students' behavior. Results suggest that school-based yoga may be advantageous for stress management and behavior.

25410198	The influence of tai chi and yoga on balance and falls in a residential care setting: A randomised controlled trial.	Abstract Falls amongst older people is a global public health concern. Whilst falling is not a typical feature of ageing, older people are more likely to fall. Fall injuries amongst older people are a leading cause of death and disability. Many older people do not do regular exercise so that they lose muscle tone, strength, and flexibility which affect balance and predispose them to falls. The management of falls in residential care settings is a major concern with strategies for prevention and monitoring a focus in this setting. Yoga and tai chi have shown potential to improve balance and prevent falls in older adults. They also have potential to improve pain and quality of life. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of conducting a three-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) with frail older people in a residential care setting to test the hypothesis that a 14-week modified tai chi or yoga programme is more effective than usual care activity in improving balance function, quality of life, pain experience and in reducing number of falls. There were no statistically significant differences between the three groups in the occurrence of falls. Yoga demonstrated a slight decrease in fall incidence; quality of life improved for the tai chi group. Only the yoga group experienced a reduction in average pain scores though not statistically significant. The findings of the study suggest it is possible to safely implement modified yoga and tai chi in a residential care setting and evaluate this using RCT design. They show positive changes to balance, pain and quality of life and a high level of interest through attendance amongst the older participants. The results support offering tai chi and yoga to older people who are frail and dependent with physical and cognitive limitations.

25408140	Blood pressure and heart rate variability during yoga-based alternate nostril breathing practice and breath awareness.	BACKGROUND: Previous research has shown a reduction in blood pressure (BP) immediately after the practice of alternate nostril yoga breathing (ANYB) in normal healthy male volunteers and in hypertensive patients of both sexes. The BP during ANYB has not been recorded. MATERIAL/METHODS: Participants were 26 male volunteers (group mean age +/-SD, 23.8+/-3.5 years). We assessed (1) heart rate variability, (2) non-invasive arterial BP, and (3) respiration rate, during (a) ANYB and (b) breath awareness (BAW) sessions. Each session was 25 minutes. We performed assessments at 3 time points: Pre (5 minutes), during (15 minutes; for ANYB or BAW) and Post (5 minutes). A naive-to-yoga control group (n=15 males, mean age +/-SD 26.1+/-4.0 years) were assessed while seated quietly for 25 minutes. RESULTS: During ANYB there was a significant decrease (repeated measures ANOVA) in systolic BP and respiration rate; while RMSSD (the square root of the mean of the sum of squares of differences between adjacent NN intervals) and NN50 (the number of interval differences of successive normal to normal intervals greater than 50 ms) significantly increased. During BAW respiration rate decreased. In contrast, respiration rate increased during the control state. ANYB and BAW were significantly different (2-factor ANOVA) in RMSSD and respiration rate. BAW and control were different with respect to respiration rate. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that vagal activity increased during and after ANYB, which could have contributed to the decrease in BP and changes in the HRV.

25401042	Participant Characteristics Associated with Symptomatic Improvement from Yoga for Chronic Low Back Pain.	CONTEXT: Studies suggest that yoga is effective for moderate to severe chronic low back pain (cLBP) in diverse predominantly lower socioeconomic status populations. However, little is known about factors associated with benefit from the yoga intervention. OBJECTIVE: Identify factors at baseline independently associated with greater efficacy among participants in a study of yoga for cLBP. DESIGN: From September-December 2011, a 12-week randomized dosing trial was conducted comparing weekly vs. twice-weekly 75-minute hatha yoga classes for 95 predominantly low-income minority adults with nonspecific cLBP. Participant characteristics collected at baseline were used to determine factors beyond treatment assignment (reported in the initial study) that predicted outcome. We used bivariate testing to identify baseline characteristics associated with improvement in function and pain, and included select factors in a multivariate linear regression. SETTING: Recruitment and classes occurred in an academic safety-net hospital and five affiliated community health centers in Boston, Massachusetts. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-five adults with nonspecific cLBP, ages ranging from 20-64 (mean 48) years; 72 women and 23 men. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were changes in back-related function (modified Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, RMDQ; 0-23) and mean low back pain intensity (0-10) in the previous week, from baseline to week 12. RESULTS: Adjusting for group assignment, baseline RMDQ, age, and gender, foreign nationality and lower baseline SF36 physical component score (PCS) were independently associated with improvement in RMDQ. Greater than high school education level, cLBP less than 1 year, and lower baseline SF36 PCS were independently associated with improvement in pain intensity. Other demographics including race, income, gender, BMI, and use of pain medications were not associated with either outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Poor physical health at baseline is associated with greater improvement from yoga in back-related function and pain. Race, income, and body mass index do not affect the potential for a person with low back pain to experience benefit from yoga.

25398263	An explorative study of metabolic responses to mental stress and yoga practices in yoga practitioners, non-yoga practitioners and individuals with metabolic syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Stress places a metabolic burden on homeostasis and is linked to heightened sympathetic activity, increased energy expenditure and pathology. The yogic state is a hypometabolic state that corresponds with mind-body coherence and reduced stress. This study aimed to investigate metabolic responses to stress and different yoga practices in regular yoga practitioners (YP), non-yoga practitioners (NY) and metabolic syndrome patients (MS). METHODS: YP (n = 16), NY (n = 15) and MS (n = 15) subjects underwent an experimental protocol that comprised of different 5-minute interventions including mental arithmetic stress test (MAST), alternate nostril breathing (ANB), Kapabhati breathing (KB) and meditation (Med) interspersed with 5 minutes of quiet resting (neutral condition (NC)). During the intervention periods continuous body weight adjusted oxygen consumption (VO2ml/min/kg) was measured using open circuit indirect calorimetry with a canopy hood. RESULTS: This is the first study to report oxygen consumption (OC) in yoga practitioners during and after MAST and the first to report both within and between different populations. The results were analysed with SPSS 16 using 3X9 mixed factorial ANOVAs. The single between-subject factor was group (YP, NY and MS), the single within-subject factor was made up of the nine intervention phases (NC1, MAST, NC2, ANB, NC3, KB, NC4, Med, NC5). The results demonstrated that the regular YP group had significantly less OC and greater variability in their OC across all phases compared to the MS group (p = .003) and NY group (p = .01). All groups significantly raised their OC during the mental arithmetic stress, however the MS group had a significantly blunted post-stress recovery whereas the YP group rapidly recovered back to baseline levels with post stress recovery being greater than either the NY group or MS group. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga practitioners have greater metabolic variability compared to non-yoga practitioners and metabolic syndrome patients with reduced oxygen requirements during resting conditions and more rapid post-stress recovery. OC in metabolic syndrome patients displays significantly blunted post-stress recovery demonstrating reduced metabolic resilience. Our results support the findings of previous randomised trials that suggest regular yoga practice may mitigate against the effects of metabolic syndrome.

25397830	Perceptions of providers and administrators in the Veterans Health Administration regarding complementary and alternative medicine.	BACKGROUND: The integration of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies into a large organization such as the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) requires cultural change and deliberate planning to ensure feasibility and buy-in from staff and patients. At present, there is limited knowledge of VHA patient care providers' and administrators' viewpoints regarding CAM therapies and their implementation. OBJECTIVES: Our purpose was to qualitatively examine knowledge, attitudes, perceived value and perceived barriers, and/or facilitators to CAM program implementation among VHA providers and administrators at a large VHA facility. RESEARCH DESIGN: We are reporting the qualitative interview portion of a mixed-methods study. SUBJECTS: Twenty-eight participants (patient care providers or administrators) were purposely chosen to represent a spectrum of positions and services. Participants' experience with and exposure to CAM therapies varied. MEASURES: Individual interviews were conducted using a semi-structured format and were digitally recorded, transcribed, and coded for themes. RESULTS: Recurrent themes included: a range of knowledge about CAM; benefits for patients and staff; and factors that can be facilitators or barriers including evidence-based practice or perceived lack thereof, prevailing culture, leadership at all levels, and lack of position descriptions for CAM therapists. Participants rated massage, meditation, acupuncture, and yoga as priorities for promotion across the VHA. CONCLUSIONS: Despite perceived challenges, providers and administrators recognized the value of CAM and potential for expansion of CAM within the VHA. Interview results could inform the process of incorporating CAM into a plan for meeting VHA Strategic Goal One of personalized, proactive, patient-driven health care across the VHA.

25397827	A systematic scoping review of complementary and alternative medicine mind and body practices to improve the health of veterans and military personnel.	BACKGROUND: Meditation, imagery, acupuncture, and yoga are the most frequently offered mind and body practices in the Department of Veterans Affairs. Yet, the research on mind and body practices has been critiqued as being too limited in evidence and scope to inform clinical treatment. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic scoping review of mind and body practices used with veterans or active duty military personnel to identify gaps in the literature and make recommendations for future primary research. RESEARCH DESIGN: Following systematic literature review methodology, we searched 5 databases using 27 different National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine-defined mind and body practices as text words, keywords, and MeSH terms through June 30, 2014. We also conducted handsearches of 4 previous reviews. SUBJECTS: Active duty military members or veterans 18 years or older participating in mind and body practice interventions globally. MEASURES: Data were extracted from studies meeting 5 inclusion criteria. The quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was assessed using an existing checklist. RESULTS: Of 1819 studies identified, 89 interventions (50 RCTs) published between 1976 and 2014, conducted in 9 countries, using 152 different measures to assess 65 health and well-being outcomes met our inclusion criteria. Most interventions took place in the United States (n=78). Meditation practices (n=25), relaxation techniques including imagery (n=20), spinal manipulation including physical therapy (n=16), and acupuncture (n=11) were the most frequently studied practices. Methodological quality of most RCTs was rated poorly. CONCLUSIONS: Meditation and acupuncture practices are among the most frequently offered and studied mind and body practices. Future research should include yoga as it is currently understudied among veterans and military personnel. A repository of mind and body intervention outcome measures may further future research efforts, as would conducting pragmatic trials and more robust RCTs.

25397821	Physical health, mental health, and utilization of complementary and alternative medicine services among Gulf War veterans.	BACKGROUND: Gulf War veterans represent a unique subset of the veteran population. It has been challenging to identify interventions that result in improvements in physical and mental health for this population. Recently, there has been recognition of a potential role for complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interventions. OBJECTIVES: This paper examines the characteristics of Gulf War and non-Gulf War veterans referred to a CAM clinic, and explores the utilization of services by this population. METHOD AND SUBJECTS: Participants included 226 veterans enrolled in a CAM clinic at a Veterans Affairs medical center, 42 of whom were Gulf War veterans. Self-report measures of physical/mental health were administered, and service utilization was obtained from participants' medical records for a 6-month period. RESULTS: Gulf War veterans enrolled in the program reported more severe physical and mental health symptoms than non-Gulf War veterans. However, examining only veterans who participated in services in the 6 months following enrollment, the 2 groups reported similar symptom severity. Both groups were similar in their attendance of individual acupuncture and iRest yoga nidra, although Gulf War veterans attended fewer sessions of group acupuncture. CONCLUSIONS: Although Gulf War veterans who enroll in a CAM program may have more severe symptoms than non-Gulf War veterans, those who actually participate in services are similar to non-Gulf War veterans on these measures. These groups also differ in their pattern of service utilization. Future research should explore the reasons for these differences, and to identify ways to promote treatment engagement with this population.

25397818	Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) reduces anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation in veterans.	INTRODUCTION: Anxiety, depression, and pain are major problems among veterans, despite the availability of standard medical options within the Veterans Health Administration. Complementary and alternative approaches for these symptoms have been shown to be appealing to veterans. One such complementary and alternative approach is mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a brief course that teaches mindfulness meditation with demonstrated benefits for mood disorders and pain. METHODS: We prospectively collected data on MBSR's effectiveness among 79 veterans at an urban Veterans Health Administration medical facility. The MBSR course had 9 weekly sessions that included seated and walking meditations, gentle yoga, body scans, and discussions of pain, stress, and mindfulness. Pre-MBSR and post-MBSR questionnaires investigating pain, anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation, and physical and mental health functioning were obtained and compared for individuals. We also conducted a mediation analysis to determine whether changes in mindfulness were related to changes in the other outcomes. RESULTS: Significant reductions in anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation were observed after MBSR training. Mental health functioning scores were improved. Also, mindfulness interacted with other outcomes such that increases in mindfulness were related to improvements in anxiety, depression, and mental health functionality. Pain intensity and physical health functionality did not show improvements. DISCUSSION: This naturalistic study in veterans shows that completing an MBSR program can improve symptoms of anxiety and depression, in addition to reducing suicidal ideations, all of which are of critical importance to the overall health of the patients.

25395844	Twelve weeks of BodyBalance(R) training improved balance and functional task performance in middle-aged and older adults.	PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of BodyBalance((R)) training on balance, functional task performance, fear of falling, and health-related quality of life in adults aged over 55 years. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A total of 28 healthy, active adults aged 66+/-5 years completed the randomized controlled trial. Balance, functional task performance, fear of falling, and self-reported quality of life were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks. Participants either undertook two sessions of BodyBalance per week for 12 weeks (n=15) or continued with their normal activities (n=13). RESULTS: Significant group-by-time interactions were found for the timed up and go (P=0.038), 30-second chair stand (P=0.037), and mediolateral center-of-pressure range in narrow stance with eyes closed (P=0.017). There were no significant effects on fear of falling or self-reported quality of life. CONCLUSION: Twelve weeks of BodyBalance training is effective at improving certain balance and functional based tasks in healthy older adults.

25395709	Yoga effects on physical activity and sexual satisfaction among the Iranian women with multiple sclerosis: a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and disabling disease resulting in disabilities in young and middle-aged persons. In this study, researchers explored the effect of yoga techniques on physical activities and sexual function among some Iranian women with MS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 60 Iranian women with multiple sclerosis (MS) were placed in two equally divided control and case groups through random selection to assess pre-and post-effects of yoga exercises on their physical activities and sexual satisfaction levels. Women in case group were offered a series of yoga training and exercises for 3 months, which consisted of 8 sessions per month for 60 to 90 minutes at each session. Yoga training program included the 3 principles of slow motions (Hatayoga), respiratory exercises (Pranayama) and centralization to control mind via meditation, expansion and stasis (Rajayoga). After 3 months both groups were surveyed using the initial questionnaire to evaluate and compare findings with the base-line data. RESULTS: Researchers found significant statistical difference in physical activity and sexual satisfaction levels among the women in case group (P=0.001). Women in case group showed improvement in physical ability while women in control group manifested exacerbated symptoms. CONCLUSION: Yoga techniques may improve physical activities and sexual satisfaction function of women with MS.	Najafidoulatabad, Shahla;Mohebbi, Zinat;Nooryan, Khierollah	2014
25395114	Noninvasive and alternative management of chronic low back pain (efficacy and outcomes).	OBJECTIVES: The goal of this article is to provide a thorough literature review of available noninvasive and alternative treatment options for chronic low back pain. In particular, the efficacy of each therapy is evaluated and pertinent outcomes are described. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search for available literature was done through PubMed and Cochrane data base for topics discussed in this paper. RESULTS: Relevant current and past references were reviewed and presented to reflect the efficacy of each therapy and related outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: There are a wide variety of noninvasive and alternative therapies for the treatment of chronic low back pain. Those with the strongest evidence in the literature for good efficacy and outcomes include exercise therapy with supervised physical therapy, multidisciplinary biopsychosocial rehabilitation, and acupuncture. Therapies with fair evidence or moderately supported by literature include yoga, back schools, thermal modalities, acupressure, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. Those therapies with poor evidence or little to no literature support include manipulation, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, low-level laser therapy, reflexology, biofeedback, progressive relaxation, hypnosis, and aromatherapy. Providers delivering care for patients with chronic low back pain must carefully evaluate these available treatment options related to their efficacy or lack thereof as well as relevant outcomes.

25390344	Yoga for multiple sclerosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	While yoga seems to be effective in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders, the evidence of efficacy in multiple sclerosis remains unclear. The aim of this review was to systematically assess and meta-analyze the available data on efficacy and safety of yoga in patients with multiple sclerosis. Medline/PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, CAM-Quest, CAMbase, and IndMED were searched through March 2014. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of yoga for patients with multiple sclerosis were included if they assessed health-related quality of life, fatigue, and/or mobility. Mood, cognitive function, and safety were defined as secondary outcome measures. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. Seven RCTs with a total of 670 patients were included. Evidence for short-term effects of yoga compared to usual care were found for fatigue (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.52; 95% confidence intervals (CI) = -1.02 to -0.02; p = 0.04; heterogeneity: I2 = 60%; Chi2 = 7.43; p = 0.06) and mood (SMD = -0.55; 95%CI = -0.96 to -0.13; p = 0.01; heterogeneity: I2 = 0%; Chi2 = 1.25; p = 0.53), but not for health-related quality of life, muscle function, or cognitive function. The effects on fatigue and mood were not robust against bias. No short-term or longer term effects of yoga compared to exercise were found. Yoga was not associated with serious adverse events. In conclusion, since no methodological sound evidence was found, no recommendation can be made regarding yoga as a routine intervention for patients with multiple sclerosis. Yoga might be considered a treatment option for patients who are not adherent to recommended exercise regimens.	Cramer, Holger;Lauche, Romy;Azizi, Hoda;Dobos, Gustav;Langhorst, Jost	2014
25386867	The exercise patterns of pregnant women in Taiwan.	BACKGROUND: Unless advised otherwise by their doctor, pregnant women should get approximately 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most days. However, most pregnant women do not exercise regularly and do not meet the American College of Obstetricians Gynecology's standard for the minimum amount of exercise needed to stay healthy during pregnancy. PURPOSE: We investigate the factors related to regular exercise among pregnant women and describe the type, duration, and change in regular exercise from prepregnancy to pregnancy in Taiwan. METHODS: Pregnant women (N = 692) completed a questionnaire on exercise habits and were then grouped into regular exercise (105, 15.2%) and nonregular exercise (587, 84.8%) groups. Demographic and exercise-related variables were then investigated for their association with exercise during pregnancy. RESULTS: Work status, prepregnancy exercise, and trimester were significant predictors of regular exercise during pregnancy. The most commonly reported exercise types were walking, climbing stairs, and yoga. Nearly four fifths (n = 526, 76.0%) of participants did not exercise regularly before pregnancy, whereas 42.9% of participants continued exercising regularly after becoming pregnant. Among those who were inactive before pregnancy, 10.1% began exercising after becoming pregnant. In contrast, 57.1% of participants who had been more active before pregnancy stopped exercising regularly after becoming pregnant. Overall, it was found that participants decreased their amount (minutes x times/week) of exercise compared with their prepregnancy amount. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that walking and climbing stairs, each beneficial to the health of pregnant women, are the most common types of regular exercise engaged in by pregnant women in Taiwan. Regular exercise benefits the health of pregnant women. The findings of this study may be useful to doctors and nurses responsible to counsel pregnant women to exercise regularly and to have a reasonably active lifestyle during pregnancy.

25386666	Aerobic physical exercise for adult patients with haematological malignancies.	BACKGROUND: Although people with haematological malignancies have to endure long phases of therapy and immobility which is known to diminish their physical performance level, the advice to rest and avoid intensive exercises is still common practice. This recommendation is partly due to the severe anaemia and thrombocytopenia from which many patients suffer. The inability to perform activities of daily living restricts them, diminishes their quality of life and can influence medical therapy. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy, safety and feasibility of aerobic physical exercise for adults suffering from haematological malignancies. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2014, Issue 1) and MEDLINE (1950 to January 2014) as well as conference proceedings for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs comparing an aerobic physical exercise intervention, intending to improve the oxygen system, in addition to standard care with standard care only for adults suffering from haematological malignancies. We also included studies that evaluated aerobic exercise in addition to strength training. We excluded studies that investigated the effect of training programmes that were composed of yoga, tai chi chuan, qigong or similar types of exercise. We also excluded studies exploring the influence of strength training without additive aerobic exercise. Additionally, we excluded studies assessing outcomes without any clinical impact. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed the quality of trials. We used risk ratios (RRs) for adverse events and 100-day survival, standardised mean differences for quality of life (QoL), fatigue, and physical performance, and mean differences for anthropometric measurements. MAIN RESULTS: Our search strategies identified 1518 potentially relevant references. Of these, we included nine RCTs involving 818 participants. The potential risk of bias in these trials is unclear, due to poor reporting.The majority of participants suffered from acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), malignant lymphoma and multiple myeloma, and six trials randomised people receiving stem cell transplantation. Mostly, the exercise intervention consisted of various walking intervention programmes with different duration and intensity levels.Our primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) was not analysed in any of the included trials, but three trials reported deceased participants during the course of the study or during the first 100 days. There is no evidence for a difference between participants exercising and those in the control group (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.47; P = 0.75; 3 trials, 269 participants, moderate quality of evidence).Four trials analysed the influence of exercise intervention on quality of life (QoL). Excluding one trial with serious baseline imbalances, physical exercise improves QoL (SMD 0.26; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.49; P = 0.03; 3 trials, 291 participants, low quality of evidence). This positive effect of exercise was also found in the subscales physical functioning (SMD 0.33; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.52; P = 0.0009; 4 trials, 422 participants, moderate quality of evidence) and depression (SMD 0.25; 95% CI -0.00 to 0.50; P = 0.05; 3 trials, 249 participants, low quality of evidence). However, there is no evidence for a difference between additional exercise and standard treatment for the subscale anxiety (SMD -0.18; 95% CI -0.64 to 0.28; P = 0.45; 3 trials, 249 participants, low quality of evidence). Seven trials (692 participants) evaluated fatigue. There is moderate quality of evidence that exercise improves fatigue (SMD 0.24; 95% CI 0.08 to 0.40; P = 0.003).Eight studies evaluated various aspects of physical performance (e.g. aerobic capacity, cardiovascular fitness), but none of them could be pooled in a meta-analysis. In seven trials there is a tendency or statistically significant effect favouring the exercise group (very low quality of evidence).Three trials (266 participants) investigated serious adverse events (SAEs) (e.g. bleeding, fever, pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, and infection), and one trial (122 participants) assessed adverse events (AEs). There is no evidence for a difference between arms in terms of SAEs (RR 1.44; 95% CI 0.96 to 2.18; P = 0.06) or AEs (RR 7.23; 95% CI 0.38 to 137.05; P = 0.19); both findings are based on low quality of evidence. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence for differences in mortality between the exercise and control groups. Physical exercise added to standard care can improve quality of life, especially physical functioning, depression and fatigue. Currently, there is inconclusive evidence regarding anxiety, physical performance, serious adverse events and adverse events.We need further trials with more participants and longer follow-up periods to evaluate the effects of exercise intervention for people suffering from haematological malignancies. Furthermore, we need trials with overall survival as the primary outcome to determine whether the suggested benefits will translate into a survival advantage. To enhance comparability of study data, development and implementation of core sets of measuring devices would be helpful.

25380593	Long Latency Auditory Evoked Potentials during Meditation.	The auditory sensory pathway has been studied in meditators, using midlatency and short latency auditory evoked potentials. The present study evaluated long latency auditory evoked potentials (LLAEPs) during meditation. Sixty male participants, aged between 18 and 31 years (group mean+/-SD, 20.5+/-3.8 years), were assessed in 4 mental states based on descriptions in the traditional texts. They were (a) random thinking, (b) nonmeditative focusing, (c) meditative focusing, and (d) meditation. The order of the sessions was randomly assigned. The LLAEP components studied were P1 (40-60 ms), N1 (75-115 ms), P2 (120-180 ms), and N2 (180-280 ms). For each component, the peak amplitude and peak latency were measured from the prestimulus baseline. There was significant decrease in the peak latency of the P2 component during and after meditation (P<.001; analysis of variance and post hoc analysis with Bonferroni adjustment). The P1, P2, and N2 components showed a significant decrease in peak amplitudes during random thinking (P<.01; P<.001; P<.01, respectively) and nonmeditative focused thinking (P<.01; P<.01; P<.05, respectively). The results suggest that meditation facilitates the processing of information in the auditory association cortex, whereas the number of neurons recruited was smaller in random thinking and non-meditative focused thinking, at the level of the secondary auditory cortex, auditory association cortex and anterior cingulate cortex.

25368562	Potential self-regulatory mechanisms of yoga for psychological health.	Research suggesting the beneficial effects of yoga on myriad aspects of psychological health has proliferated in recent years, yet there is currently no overarching framework by which to understand yoga's potential beneficial effects. Here we provide a theoretical framework and systems-based network model of yoga that focuses on integration of top-down and bottom-up forms of self-regulation. We begin by contextualizing yoga in historical and contemporary settings, and then detail how specific components of yoga practice may affect cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and autonomic output under stress through an emphasis on interoception and bottom-up input, resulting in physical and psychological health. The model describes yoga practice as a comprehensive skillset of synergistic process tools that facilitate bidirectional feedback and integration between high- and low-level brain networks, and afferent and re-afferent input from interoceptive processes (somatosensory, viscerosensory, chemosensory). From a predictive coding perspective we propose a shift to perceptual inference for stress modulation and optimal self-regulation. We describe how the processes that sub-serve self-regulation become more automatized and efficient over time and practice, requiring less effort to initiate when necessary and terminate more rapidly when no longer needed. To support our proposed model, we present the available evidence for yoga affecting self-regulatory pathways, integrating existing constructs from behavior theory and cognitive neuroscience with emerging yoga and meditation research. This paper is intended to guide future basic and clinical research, specifically targeting areas of development in the treatment of stress-mediated psychological disorders.

25367403	Mindfulness-based cancer recovery and supportive-expressive therapy maintain telomere length relative to controls in distressed breast cancer survivors.	BACKGROUND: Group psychosocial interventions including mindfulness-based cancer recovery (MBCR) and supportive-expressive group therapy (SET) can help breast cancer survivors decrease distress and influence cortisol levels. Although telomere length (TL) has been associated with breast cancer prognosis, the impact of these two interventions on TL has not been studied to date. METHODS: The objective of the current study was to compare the effects of MBCR and SET with a minimal intervention control condition (a 1-day stress management seminar) on TL in distressed breast cancer survivors in a randomized controlled trial. MBCR focused on training in mindfulness meditation and gentle Hatha yoga whereas SET focused on emotional expression and group support. The primary outcome measure was relative TL, the telomere/single-copy gene ratio, assessed before and after each intervention. Secondary outcomes were self-reported mood and stress symptoms. RESULTS: Eighty-eight distressed breast cancer survivors with a diagnosis of stage I to III cancer (using the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging system) who had completed treatment at least 3 months prior participated. Using analyses of covariance on a per-protocol sample, there were no differences noted between the MBCR and SET groups with regard to the telomere/single-copy gene ratio, but a trend effect was observed between the combined intervention group and controls (F [1,84], 3.82; P = .054; eta(2) = .043); TL in the intervention group was maintained whereas it was found to decrease for control participants. There were no associations noted between changes in TL and changes in mood or stress scores over time. CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial interventions providing stress reduction and emotional support resulted in trends toward TL maintenance in distressed breast cancer survivors, compared with decreases in usual care.

25364946	Effects of weekly one-hour Hatha yoga therapy on resilience and stress levels in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders: an eight-week randomized controlled trial.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of Hatha yoga therapy on resilience, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, and salivary alpha amylase (SAA) activity in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Single-blinded, randomized controlled study in which outpatients with schizophrenia or related psychotic disorders (according to International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision) were randomly assigned to a yoga or a control group. SETTING: November 2012-April 2013 at Yamanashi Prefectural Kita Hospital, Japan. INTERVENTIONS: In the yoga group, patients received weekly 1-hour Hatha yoga sessions, in addition to regular treatment, for 8 weeks. Those in the control group underwent regular treatment, which included a daycare rehabilitation program. OUTCOME MEASURES: Assessments included the 25-item Resilience Scale (RS), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), plasma and salivary BDNF level, and SAA activity. RESULTS: Fifty patients participated (25 in each group; mean age+/-standard deviation, 50.9+/-11.3 years; mean duration of illness, 25.0+/-10.3 years; mean total PANSS score, 78.2+/-17.3). No significant differences in changes in any variable from baseline to week 8 were found between the two groups (changes in the yoga group versus the control group: RS score, -1.6+/-19.9 versus 0.3+/-17.2; PANSS score, 0.5+/-12.0 versus 5.0+/-15.6; plasma BDNF, 41.6+/-377.0 pg/dl versus 73.4+/-346.0 pg/dl; SAA, -26.2+/-72.6 kU/l versus -13.8+/-68.0 kU/l, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Adjunct yoga therapy showed no positive changes in resilience level or stress markers. Duration and intensity of yoga sessions and the focus on patients with chronic illness may explain the negative observations in light of past positive evidence regarding yoga therapy.

25364195	Comparative study on the effect of Saptamrita Lauha and Yoga therapy in myopia.	BACKGROUND: Myopia is very common ophthalmic disease especially in children and adolescence. In Ayurvedic texts, only by the main feature impairment of distant vision myopia can be correlated with Drishtigata Rogas (2(nd) Patalgata Timira). AIM: To compare the effect of Saptamruta Lauha and Yoga therapy in myopia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In present study, a total 60 patients with age group between 8 to 30 years were selected randomly from the out-patient Department of Swasthavritta and Shalakyatantra Department of Government Ayurveda College, Trivandrum, and were divided in two groups. In Group A, Saptamrita Lauha 250 mg twice daily with unequal quantity of honey and Ghrita was administered while in Group B, patients subjected to Yoga therapy (Jala Neti, Nadi Shodhana, Shitali Pranayama and point Tratak) for 3 months duration with 1 month follow-up. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The result obtained from the study reveals that there is no significant reduction in the visual acuity and clinical refraction, but associated changes were observed as reduced in group B when compared to group A. However, relief from headache was found to be equally effective in both the groups.	Bansal, Charu	2014 Jan
25360229	Complementary & alternative management of Parkinson's disease: an evidence-based review of eastern influenced practices.	The prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD) appears to be lower in Asia compared to the Western world. It is unclear if this is related to the ubiquitous use of traditional medicine in Eastern healthcare, but the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) modalities in countries like Korea may be as high as 76%. Among patients with PD, herbal medicines, health supplement foods, and acupuncture are interventions which are increasingly used throughout the world. Countries like Korea, China, India, and Japan have long embraced and incorporated traditional medicine into modern management of conditions such as PD, but research into various CAM modalities remains in its infancy limiting evidence-based recommendations for many treatments. We reviewed the literature on CAM treatments for PD, focusing on mind-body interventions and natural products. Based on evidence limited to randomized-controlled trials we found that mind-body interventions are generally effective forms of physical activity that are likely to foster good adherence and may reduce disability associated with PD. Based on the current data, modalities like Tai Chi and dance are safe and beneficial in PD, but better studies are needed to assess the effects of other frequently used modalities such as yoga and acupuncture. Furthermore, despite centuries of experience using medicinal herbs and plants in Eastern countries, and despite substantial preclinical data on the beneficial effects of nutritional antioxidants as neuroprotective agents in PD, there is insufficient clinical evidence that any vitamin, food additive, or supplement, can improve motor function or delay disease progression in PD.

25356456	Predictors of health behavior change after an integrative medicine inpatient program.	BACKGROUND: Health behavior change can improve physical and psychosocial outcomes in internal medicine patients.Purpose This study aims to identify predictors for health behavior change after an integrative medicine inpatient program. METHOD: German internal medicine patients' (N =2,486; 80 %female; 53.9+/-14.3 years) practice frequency for aerobic exercise(e.g., walking, running, cycling, swimming), meditative movement therapies (e.g., yoga, tai ji, qigong), and relaxation techniques(e.g., progressive relaxation, mindfulness meditation,breathing exercises, guided imagery) was assessed at admission to a 14-day integrative medicine inpatient program, and 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge. Health behavior change was regressed to exercise self-efficacy, stage of change, and health locus of control (internal, external-social, external-fatalistic). RESULTS: Short-term increases in practice frequency were found for aerobic exercise: short- and long-term increases for meditative movement therapies and relaxation techniques (all p <0.01). After controlling for sociodemographic characteristics,clinical characteristics, and health status, exercise self-efficacy or interactions of exercise self-efficacy with stage of change predicted increased practice frequency of aerobic exercise at 6 months; of meditative movement therapies at 3 and 6 months; and of relaxation techniques at 3, 6, and 12 months (all p <0.05). Health locus of control predicted increased practice frequency of aerobic exercise at 3 months and of relaxation techniques at 3, 6, and 12 months (all p <0.05). CONCLUSION: Health behavior change after an integrative medicine inpatient program was predicted by self-efficacy,stage of change, and health locus of control.Considering these aspects might improve adherence to health-promoting behavior after lifestyle modification programs.

25355261	[Effect of Yoga on cancer related fatigue in breast cancer patients with chemotherapy].	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the condition of cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in breast cancer patients with chemotherapy and to explore the effect of Yoga on it. METHODS: After the completion of Yoga, 100 breast cancer patients with CRF (CFS>0) were selected and were randomly divided into the Yoga group and the control group (n=50). Patients in the control group only received routine cure and care while patients in the Yoga group received extra Yoga exercise, lasting for 4 months. Cancer fatigue scale (CFS) was evaluated in the 2nd, 4th and 6th round of chemotherapy. RESULTS: At the end, 82 cases qualified for the study, 42 cases for the control group and 40 for the Yoga group. The mean score of body fatigue was 12.67+/-3.46. There was no significant difference in CRF between the Yago group and the control group before the Yoga intervention (P>0.05). After the 4th round of chemotherapy, the mean scores of CFS and body fatigue in the Yoga group were significantly lower than that in the control group (P<0.05). After the 6th round of chemotherapy, the mean scores of CFS, body fatigue and cognitive fatigue in the Yoga group were lower than that in the control group (P<0.05). Repeated analysis of variance showed that the difference in the overall fatigue, body fatigue and cognitive fatigue between the Yoga group and the control group was significant (P<0.05); the time influence on the overall fatigue, body fatigue and emotional fatigue was significant difference between the 2 groups (P<0.05); there were interactions between the effect of Yago and time on the overall fatigue, body fatigue and cognitive fatigue (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: The body fatigue was more serious in breast cancer patients with chemotherapy. Yoga intervention could significantly reduce body fatigue, cognitive fatigue, thus reduce the overall fatigue in breast cancer patients with chemotherapy.

25355029	Are exercise programs effective for improving health-related quality of life among cancer survivors? A systematic review and meta-analysis.	PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of exercise interventions on overall health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and its domains among cancer survivors who have completed primary treatment. DATA SOURCES: 11 electronic databases were searched from inception (dates varied) to October 2011. The authors also identified eligible trials through a search of additional sources. DATA SYNTHESIS: 40 trials with 3,694 participants met the inclusion criteria. At 12 weeks, cancer survivors exposed to exercise interventions had greater positive improvement in overall HRQOL (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.16, 0.81]), emotional well-being (SMD 0.33; 95% CI [0.05, 0.61]), and social functioning (SMD 0.45; 95% CI [0.02, 0.87]); and had a significant reduction in anxiety (SMD -0.26; 95% CI [-0.44, -0.07]) and fatigue (SMD -0.82; 95% CI [-1.5, -0.14]). CONCLUSIONS: Exercise programs have a beneficial effect on HRQOL and most of its domains and can be integrated into the management plans for cancer survivors who have completed treatment. Future research is needed to help understand specific attributes of exercise programs that are beneficial for improving HRQOL within and across cancer types. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Evidence presented in this review supports the inclusion of exercise programs in clinical guidelines for the management of cancer survivors who have completed treatment, such as the Oncology Nursing Society's Putting Evidence Into Practice resource.

25343044	Yoga as Treatment for Insomnia Among Cancer Patients and Survivors: A Systematic Review.	Many cancer patients and survivors, between 15 to 90%, report some form of insomnia or sleep quality impairment during and post-treatment, such as excessive daytime napping, difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, and waking up too early. Insomnia and sleep quality impairment are among the most prevalent and distressing problems reported by cancer patients and survivors, and can be severe enough to increase cancer mortality. Despite the ubiquity of insomnia and sleep quality impairment, they are under-diagnosed and under-treated in cancer patients and survivors. When sleep problems are present, providers and patients are often hesitant to prescribe or take pharmaceuticals for sleep problems due to poly pharmacy concerns, and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia can be very difficult and impractical for patients to adhere to throughout the cancer experience. Research suggests yoga is a well-tolerated exercise intervention with promising evidence for its efficacy in improving insomnia and sleep quality impairment among survivors. This article provides a systematic review of existing clinical research on the effectiveness of yoga for treating insomnia and sleep quality impairment among cancer patients and survivors.

25342209	Randomised controlled trial of a 12 week yoga intervention on negative affective states, cardiovascular and cognitive function in post-cardiac rehabilitation patients.	BACKGROUND: Negative affective states such as anxiety, depression and stress are significant risk factors for cardiovascular disease, particularly in cardiac and post-cardiac rehabilitation populations.Yoga is a balanced practice of physical exercise, breathing control and meditation that can reduce psychosocial symptoms as well as improve cardiovascular and cognitive function. It has the potential to positively affect multiple disease pathways and may prove to be a practical adjunct to cardiac rehabilitation in further reducing cardiac risk factors as well as improving self-efficacy and post-cardiac rehabilitation adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviours. METHOD AND DESIGN: This is a parallel arm, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial that will assess the outcomes of post- phase 2 cardiac rehabilitation patients assigned to a yoga intervention in comparison to a no-treatment wait-list control group. Participants randomised to the yoga group will engage in a 12 week yoga program comprising of two group based sessions and one self-administered home session each week. Group based sessions will be led by an experienced yoga instructor. This will involve teaching beginner students a hatha yoga sequence that incorporates asana (poses and postures), pranayama (breathing control) and meditation. The primary outcomes of this study are negative affective states of anxiety, depression and stress assessed using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale. Secondary outcomes include measures of quality of life, and cardiovascular and cognitive function. The cardiovascular outcomes will include blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability, pulse wave velocity, carotid intima media thickness measurements, lipid/glucose profiles and C-reactive protein assays. Assessments will be conducted prior to (week 0), mid-way through (week 6) and following the intervention period (week 12) as well as at a four week follow-up (week 16). DISCUSSION: This study will determine the effect of yoga practice on negative affective states, cardiovascular and cognitive function in post-phase 2 cardiac rehabilitation patients. The findings may provide evidence to incorporate yoga into standardised cardiac rehabilitation programs as a practical adjunct to improve the management of psychosocial symptoms associated with cardiovascular events in addition to improving patients' cognitive and cardiovascular functions.

25336852	Effects of acupuncture and massage on pain, quality of sleep and health related quality of life in patient with systemic lupus erythematosus.	A 41-years-old woman diagnosed of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) in 2006 came to our hospital - outpatient department with the complaint of severe pain and swelling over multiple joints associated with disturbed sleep/sleeplessness and poor quality of life since seven years. She received acupuncture (20 minutes) and massage (20 minutes) daily for the period of 30 days with 7 days of rest period in between after first 15 days. After intervention we observed reduction of pain in Visual Analog Scale score; improvement in day time sleepiness, and quality of sleep in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, respectively; improvement in health related quality of life in Short Form-36 version 2 (SF-36v2) Health Survey. These results showed that acupuncture and massage can be considered as an integrative approach for symptomatic management of SLE.	Mooventhan, A;Nivethitha, L	2014 Jul
25336068	Yoga and self-reported cognitive problems in breast cancer survivors: a randomized controlled trial.	OBJECTIVES: Cancer survivors often report cognitive problems. Furthermore, decreases in physical activity typically occur over the course of cancer treatment. Although physical activity benefits cognitive function in noncancer populations, evidence linking physical activity to cognitive function in cancer survivors is limited. In our recent randomized controlled trial, breast cancer survivors who received a yoga intervention had lower fatigue and inflammation following the trial compared with a wait list control group. This secondary analysis of the parent trial addressed yoga's impact on cognitive complaints. METHODS: Posttreatment stage 0-IIIA breast cancer survivors (n = 200) were randomized to a 12-week, twice-weekly Hatha yoga intervention or a wait list control group. Participants reported cognitive complaints using the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial Cognitive Problems Scale at baseline, immediately postintervention, and 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Cognitive complaints did not differ significantly between groups immediately postintervention (p = 0.250). However, at 3-month follow-up, yoga participants' Breast Cancer Prevention Trial Cognitive Problems Scale scores were an average of 23% lower than wait list participants' scores (p = 0.003). These group differences in cognitive complaints remained after controlling for psychological distress, fatigue, and sleep quality. Consistent with the primary results, those who practiced yoga more frequently reported significantly fewer cognitive problems at 3-month follow-up than those who practiced less frequently (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that yoga can effectively reduce breast cancer survivors' cognitive complaints and prompt further research on mind-body and physical activity interventions for improving cancer-related cognitive problems.

25328843	A conceptual framework of stress vulnerability, depression, and health outcomes in women: potential uses in research on complementary therapies for depression.	BACKGROUND: Depression is a chronic mental health condition that affects millions of individuals worldwide. It is well-established that psychological stress plays an integral role in depression and that depression has numerous negative health outcomes. However, a closer look at components of stress vulnerabilities and depression is required to allow for the development and testing of appropriate interventions. AIMS AND DISCUSSION: This article describes a conceptual framework about the complex and bidirectional relationship between stress vulnerability, depression, and health outcomes in women. The authors elucidate how the framework can be applied in clinical research about cellular aging and on the mechanisms of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for depression, using yoga as an example of a CAM modality. CONCLUSION: The proposed conceptual framework may be helpful for adding depth to the body of knowledge about the use of mind-body therapies for individuals at high risk of stress vulnerability and/or depression.

25327305	Effects of yoga on patients in an adolescent mental health hospital and the relationship between those effects and the patients' sensory-processing patterns.	PROBLEM: This study investigated the effects of yoga as a sensory regulation tool in reducing adolescent distress in an acute care psychiatric hospital. METHODS: This was a descriptive, correlational pre-intervention/post-intervention design conducted in a mental health hospital over 5 months from mid-January to mid-June 2012. The population consisted of a convenience sample of 75 adolescent mental health unit inpatients and partial-hospitalization patients 12-18 years of age who participated in two or more yoga sessions. Patient charts provided Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV Axes I-V diagnosis, gender, and age. Dependent variables were pulse and Subjective Units of Disturbance Scale scores, which were recorded before and after each yoga class. The Adult/Adolescent Sensory Profile provided a measure of patient sensory-processing preference levels that were related to the pulse and Subjective Units of Disturbance Scale results. FINDINGS: Yoga sessions significantly improved patient pulse and self-reported distress ratings regardless of gender or sensory profile levels. CONCLUSIONS: This article contributes to research on the therapeutic effects of yoga as a sensory regulation intervention in the treatment of psychiatrically hospitalized adolescents. Yoga has the potential to help adolescents in an acute care psychiatric hospital learn to soothe themselves, to regulate their emotions, and to find relief from emotional distress while hospitalized.

25325936	Mind-body practices in cancer care.	Being diagnosed with a life-threatening disease such as cancer and undergoing treatment can cause unwanted distress and interferes with quality of life. Uncontrolled stress can have a negative effect on a number of biological systems and processes leading to negative health outcomes. While some distress is normal, it is not benign and must be addressed, as failure to do so may compromise health and QOL outcomes. We present the evidence for the role of stress in cancer biology and mechanisms demonstrating how distress is associated with worse clinical outcomes. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network states that all patients be screened with the single-item distress thermometer and to also indicate the source of distress and to get appropriate referral. In addition to the many conventional approaches for managing distress from the fields of psychology and psychiatry, many patients are seeking strategies to manage their distress that are outside conventional medicine such as mind-body techniques. Mind-body techniques such as meditation, yoga, tai chi, and qigong have been found to lower distress and lead to improvements in different aspects of quality of life. It is essential that the standard of care in oncology include distress screening and the delivery of different techniques to help patients manage the psychosocial challenges of diagnosis and treatment of cancer.

25317861	Effects of Yoga in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure: A Meta-Analysis.	The use of yoga as an effective cardiac rehabilitation in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) remains controversial. We performed a meta-analysis to examine the effects of yoga on exercise capacity and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with CHF. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Excerpta Medica database, LILACS, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, The Scientific Electronic Library Online, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (from the earliest date available to December 2013) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effects of yoga versus exercise and/or of yoga versus control on exercise capacity (peakVO2) and quality-of-life (HRQOL) in CHF. Two reviewers selected studies independently. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 test. Two studies met the selection criteria (total: 30 yoga and 29 control patients). The results suggested that yoga compared with control had a positive impact on peak VO2 and HRQOL. Peak VO2, WMD (3.87 95% CI: 1.95 to 5.80), and global HRQOL standardized mean differences (-12.46 95% CI: -22.49 to -2.43) improved in the yoga group compared to the control group. Yoga enhances peak VO2 and HRQOL in patients with CHF and could be considered for inclusion in cardiac rehabilitation programs. Larger RCTs are required to further investigate the effects of yoga in patients with CHF.

25314108	Beyond the body: insights from an Iyengar yoga program for women with disability after breast cancer.	Lymphedema, pain, and range of motion restrictions after breast cancer remain underexplored, and few interventions have been developed for these women. Together with a yoga instructor, our interdisciplinary research team developed a yoga program for women with lymphedema after breast cancer (n = 13). Qualitative interviews and participants' journals show that there were a number of benefits to the yoga program. Themes outlining these are (1) understanding arm morbidity; (2) becoming aware of posture; and (3) countering fatigue. More surprisingly, perhaps, the participants also described the ways in which yoga furthered their understandings of loss associated with disability, the fourth theme, and showed that yoga enhanced their experiences of embodiment, the final theme. Finally, we assert that our research demonstrates the potential for qualitative research connected to the evaluation of interventions and that it demonstrates the blurring of traditional boundaries between interventions and data collection.

25305436	Characteristics of people with self-reported stress-precipitated seizures.	OBJECTIVE: Stress is the most common patient-reported seizure precipitant. We aimed to determine mood and epilepsy characteristics of people who report stress-precipitated seizures. METHODS: Sequential patients at a tertiary epilepsy center were surveyed about stress as a seizure precipitant. We asked whether acute (lasting minutes-hours) or chronic (lasting days-months) stress was a seizure precipitant, whether stress reduction had been tried, and what effect stress reduction had on seizure frequency. We collected information on antiepileptic drugs, history of depression and anxiety disorder, prior or current treatment for depression or anxiety, and scores on the Neurological Disorders Depression Inventory (NDDI-E) and Generalized Anxiety Disorders-7 (GAD-7) instruments, which are administered at every visit in our Epilepsy Center. We also asked whether respondents thought that they could predict their seizures to determine if stress as a seizure precipitant was correlated with seizure self-prediction. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-six subjects were included: 219 endorsed stress as a seizure precipitant [STRESS (+)] and 47 did not [STRESS (-)]. Among STRESS (+) subjects, 85% endorsed chronic stress as a seizure precipitant, and 68% endorsed acute stress as a seizure precipitant. In STRESS (+) subjects, 57% had used some type of relaxation or stress reduction method (most commonly yoga, exercise and meditation), and, of those who tried, 88% thought that these methods improved seizures. Among STRESS (-) subjects, 25% had tried relaxation or stress reduction, and 71% thought that seizures improved. Although univariate analysis showed multiple associations with stress as a seizure precipitant, in the multivariable logistic regression, only the GAD-7 score was associated with STRESS (+) (OR = 1.18 [1.03-1.35], p = 0.017). Subjects who reported stress as a seizure precipitant were more likely to report an ability to self-predict seizures (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Stress-precipitated seizures are commonly reported by patients, may be associated with either acute stress or chronic stress, and are associated with higher scores on anxiety tests. Patients frequently use stress reduction methods to self-treat and report high success rates. A prospective, randomized trial of stress reduction for seizures is indicated.

25303853	High prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine use in patients with genetically proven mitochondrial disorders.	Despite major advances in understanding the pathophysiology of mitochondrial diseases, clinical management of these conditions remains largely supportive, and no effective treatment is available. We therefore assumed that the burden of disease combined with the lack of adequate treatment leaves open a big market for complementary and alternative medicine use. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use and perceived effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine in children and adults with genetically proven mitochondrial disease. The reported use was surprisingly high, with 88% of children and 91% of adults having used some kind of complementary and alternative medicine in the last 2 years. Also, the mean cost of these treatments was impressive, being <euro>489/year for children and <euro>359/year for adult patients. Over-the-counter remedies (e.g., food supplements, homeopathy) and self-help techniques (e.g., Reiki, yoga) were the most frequently used complementary and alternative therapies in our cohort: 54% of children and 60% of adults reported the various complementary and alternative medicine therapies to be effective. Given the fact that currently no effective treatment exists, further research toward the different therapies is needed, as our study clearly demonstrates that such therapies are highly sought after by affected patients.

25303199	Effect of Integrated Yoga Module on Selected Psychological Variables among Women with Anxiety Problem.	The implementation of yogic practices has proven benefits in both organic and psychological diseases. Forty-five women with anxiety selected by a random sampling method were divided into three groups. Experimental group I was subjected to asanas, relaxation and pranayama while Experimental group II was subjected to an integrated yoga module. The control group did not receive any intervention. Anxiety was measured by Taylor's Manifest Anxiety Scale before and after treatment. Frustration was measured through Reaction to Frustration Scale. All data were spread in an Excel sheet to be analysed with SPSS 16 software using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Selected yoga and asanas decreased anxiety and frustration scores but treatment with an integrated yoga module resulted in significant reduction of anxiety and frustration. To conclude, the practice of asanas and yoga decreased anxiety in women, and yoga as an integrated module significantly improved anxiety scores in young women with proven anxiety without any ill effects.

25299143	Long-term and short-term effects of insomnia in cancer and effective interventions.	Sleep disorders and insomnia are more prevalent in patients with cancer than in the normal population. Sleep disorders consist of delayed sleep latency, waking episodes after sleep onset, unrefreshing sleep, reduced quality of sleep, and reduced sleep efficiency. Sleep disorders cluster with pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and vasomotor symptoms, depending on stage of disease, treatment, and comorbidities. Premorbid sleep problems and shift work have been associated with a higher prevalence of cancer; in fact, shift work has been labeled a carcinogen. Treatment for insomnia includes cognitive behavioral therapy with sleep hygiene, bright-light therapy, exercise, yoga, melatonin, and hypnotic medications. Unfortunately, there are few randomized trials in cancer-related sleep disorders such that most recommendations particularly for hypnotics are based on treatment for primary insomnia. In this article, insomnia is reviewed as a predisposing factor to cancer, prior to and during treatment, in cancer survivorship and in advanced cancer. Recommendations for treatment are based on low-quality evidence but are also reviewed.	Davis, Mellar P;Goforth, Harold W	2014 Sep-Oct
25299140	Nonpharmacologic approach to fatigue in patients with cancer.	Cancer-related fatigue is a common yet underappreciated problem with a significant impact on functional ability and quality of life. Practice guidelines mandate that all cancer patients and survivors be screened for cancer-related fatigue (CRF) at regular intervals. Comorbidities that could contribute to fatigue should be treated, and patients with moderate to severe fatigue should undergo a comprehensive evaluation. Nonpharmacologic interventions are important tools to combat CRF and should be incorporated into routine practice. Physical activity, educational interventions, and cognitive-behavioral therapy have the most supportive data and can be recommended to patients with confidence. From a practical standpoint, general education on CRF is something that most care providers can readily offer patients as part of routine care. Other interventions that appear promising but are as yet lacking convincing evidence include mindfulness-based stress reduction, yoga, and acupuncture. Reiki, Qigong, hypnosis, and music therapy may be worthy of further investigation.	Pachman, Deirdre R;Price, Katharine A;Carey, Elise C	2014 Sep-Oct

25284943	Evaluation of implementation status of national policy on Indian systems of medicine and homeopathy 2002: Stakeholders' perspective.	BACKGROUND: National Policy on Indian systems of medicine and homoeopathy (ISM and H policy) was formulated in 2002 to encourage the development of Ayurveda, Sidhha, Unani, Yoga, Naturopathy and Homoeopathy in India. This study proposes to assess the views of public health experts on current implementation of ISM and H Policy. METHODS: An online questionnaire was designed to ascertain the views of public health experts on ISM and H Policy and mailed to 100 public health experts. The tool was tested for content validity and a pilot study was done. Results were analyzed with the help of SPSS version 16. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Response rate was 61%. Majority of experts considered implementation status of ISM and H Policy as poor. Lack of quality education was mentioned as major factor responsible for current scenario of ISM and H Policy by most of experts. Lack of funds and government support were emerged as major bottlenecks in implementation of ISM and H Policy.	Singh, Balpreet;Kumar, Manoj;Singh, Amarjeet	2013 Oct
25284940	A self-rating scale to measure tridosas in children.	BACKGROUND: Self - rating inventories to assess the Prakrti (constitution) and personality have been developed and validated for adults. To analyze the effect of personality development programs on Prakrti of the children, standardized scale is not available. Hence, present study was carried out to develop and standardize Caraka Child Personality inventory (CCPI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 77- item CCPI scale was developed on the basis of translation of Sanskrit verses describing vataja (a), pittaja (b) and kaphaja prakrti (c) characteristics described in Ayurveda texts and by taking the opinions of 5 Ayurveda experts and psychologists. The scale was administered on children of the age group 8-12 years in New Generation National public school, Bangalore. RESULTS: This inventory was named CCPI and showed excellent internal consistency. The Cronbach's alpha for A, B and C scales were 0.54, 0.64 and 0.64 respectively. The Split - Half reliability scores for A, B and C subscales were 0.64. 0.60 and 0.66 respectively. Factor validity coefficient Scores on each item was above 0.4. Scores on vataja, pittaja and kaphaja scales were inversely correlated. Test-retest reliability scores for A,B and C scales were 0.87,0.88 and 0.89 respectively. The result of CCPI was compared with a parent rating scale Ayurveda Child Personality Inventory (ACPI). Subscales of CCPI correlated significantly highly (above 0.80) with subscales of ACPI which was done for the purpose of cross-validation with respect to ACPI. CONCLUSIONS: The prakrti of the children can be measured consistently by this scale. Correlations with ACPI pointed toward concurrent validity.	Suchitra, S P;Nagendra, H R	2013 Oct
25281881	Influence of long-term Sahaja Yoga meditation practice on emotional processing in the brain: An ERP study.	Despite growing interest in meditation as a tool for alternative therapy of stress-related and psychosomatic diseases, brain mechanisms of beneficial influences of meditation practice on health and quality of life are still unclear. We propose that the key point is a persistent change in emotional functioning, specifically the modulation of the early appraisal of motivational significance of events. The main aim was to study the effects of long-term meditation practice on event-related brain potentials (ERPs) during affective picture viewing. ERPs were recorded in 20 long-term Sahaja Yoga meditators and 20 control subjects without prior experience in meditation. The meditators' mid-latency (140-400ms) ERPs were attenuated for both positive and negative pictures (i.e. there were no arousal-related increases in ERP positivity) and this effect was more prominent over the right hemisphere. However, we found no differences in the long latency (400-800ms) responses to emotional images, associated with meditation practice. In addition we found stronger ERP negativity in the time window 200-300ms for meditators compared to the controls, regardless of picture valence. We assume that long-term meditation practice enhances frontal top-down control over fast automatic salience detection, based on amygdala functions.

25278866	Processing of proprioceptive and vestibular body signals and self-transcendence in Ashtanga yoga practitioners.	In the rod and frame test (RFT), participants are asked to set a tilted visual linear marker (i.e., a rod), embedded in a square, to the subjective vertical, irrespective of the surrounding frame. People not influenced by the frame tilt are defined as field-independent, while people biased in their rod verticality perception are field-dependent. Performing RFT requires the integration of proprioceptive, vestibular and visual signals with the latter accounting for field-dependency. Studies indicate that motor experts in body-related, balance-improving disciplines tend to be field-independent, i.e., better at verticality perception, suggesting that proprioceptive and vestibular expertise acquired by such exercise may weaken the influence of irrelevant visual signals. What remains unknown is whether the effect of body-related expertise in weighting perceptual information might also be mediated by personality traits, in particular those indexing self-focusing abilities. To explore this issue, we tested field-dependency in a class of body experts, namely yoga practitioners and in non-expert participants. Moreover we explored any link between performance on RFT and self-transcendence (ST), a complex personality construct, which refers to tendency to experience spiritual feelings and ideas. As expected, yoga practitioners (i) were more accurate in assessing the rod's verticality on the RFT, and (ii) expressed significantly higher ST. Interestingly, the performance in these two tests was negatively correlated. More specifically, when asked to provide verticality judgments, highly self-transcendent yoga practitioners were significantly less influenced by a misleading visual context. Our results suggest that being highly self-transcendent may enable yoga practitioners to optimize verticality judgment tasks by relying more on internal (vestibular and proprioceptive) signals coming from their own body, rather than on exteroceptive, visual cues.

25272001	Exercise programs for people with dementia.	BACKGROUND: This is an update of our previous 2008 review. Several recent trials and systematic reviews of the impact of exercise on people with dementia are reporting promising fi ndings. OBJECTIVE: Primary: Do exercise programs for older people with dementia improve cognition, activities of daily living (ADLs), challenging behaviour, depression, and mortality in older people with dementia? Secondary: Do exercise programs for older people with dementia have an indirect impact on family caregivers' burden, quality of life, and mortality? Do exercise programs for older people with dementia reduce the use of healthcare services (e.g. visits to the emergency department) by participants and their family caregivers? METHODS: SEARCH METHODS: We identi fi ed trials for inclusion in the review by searching ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register, on 4 September 2011, and again on 13 August 2012. The search terms used were: 'physical activity' OR exercise OR cycling OR swim* OR gym* OR walk* OR danc* OR yoga OR 'tai chi'. SELECTION CRITERIA: In this review, we included randomized controlled trials in which older people, diagnosed with dementia, were allocated either to exercise programs or to control groups (usual care or social contact/activities) with the aim of improving cognition, ADLs, behaviour, depression, and mortality. Secondary outcomes related to the family caregiver(s) and included caregiver burden, quality of life, mortality, and use of healthcare services. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Independently, at least two authors assessed the retrieved articles for inclusion, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data. Data were analysed for summary effects using RevMan 5.1 software. We calculated mean differences or standardized mean difference (SMD) for continuous data, and synthesized data for each outcome using a fi xed-effect model, unless there was substantial heterogeneity between studies, when we used a random-effects model. We planned to explore heterogeneity in relation to severity and type of dementia, and type, frequency, and duration of exercise program. We also evaluated adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen trials with 937 participants met the inclusion criteria. However, the required data from three trials and some of the data from a fourth trial were not published and not made available. The included trials were highly heterogeneous in terms of subtype and severity of participants' dementia, and type, duration and frequency of exercise. Only two trials included participants living at home. Our meta-analysis suggested that exercise programs might have a signi fi cant impact on improving cognitive functioning (eight trials, 329 participants; SMD 0.55, 95% con fi dence interval (CI) 0.02 to 1.09). However, there was substantial heterogeneity between trials (I 2 value 80%), most of which we were unable to explain. We repeated the analysis omitting one trial, an outlier, that included only participants with moderate or severe dementia. This reduced the heterogeneity somewhat (I2 value 68%), and produced a result that was no longer signi fi cant (seven trials, 308 participants; SMD 0.31, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.74). We found a signi fi cant effect of exercise programs on the ability of people with dementia to perform ADLs (six studies, 289 participants; SMD 0.68, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.27). However, again we observed considerable unexplained statistical heterogeneity (I2 value 77%) in this meta-analysis. This means that there is a need for caution in interpreting these fi ndings. In further analyses, we found that the burden experienced by informal caregivers providing care in the home may be reduced when they supervise the participation of the family member with dementia in an exercise program (one study, 40 participants; MD -15.30, 95% CI -24.73 to -5.87), but we found no signi fi cant effect of exercise on challenging behaviours (one study, 110 participants; MD -0.60, 95% CI -4.22 to 3.02), or depression (six studies, 341 participants; MD -0.14, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.07). We could not examine the remaining outcomes, quality of life, mortality, and healthcare costs, as either the appropriate data were not reported, or we did not retrieve trials that examined these outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is promising evidence that exercise programs can have a signi fi cant impact in improving ability to perform ADLs and possibly in improving cognition in people with dementia, although some caution is advised in interpreting these fi ndings. The programs revealed no signi fi cant effect on challenging behaviours or depression. There was little or no evidence regarding the remaining outcomes of interest.	Cendoroglo, Maysa Seabra	2014
25271201	Disc extrusions and bulges in nonspecific low back pain and sciatica: Exploratory randomised controlled trial comparing yoga therapy and normal medical treatment.	BACKGROUND: Previous trials of yoga therapy for nonspecific low back pain (nsLBP) (without sciatica) showed beneficial effects. OBJECTIVE: To test effects of yoga therapy on pain and disability associated with lumbar disc extrusions and bulges. METHODS: Parallel-group, randomised, controlled trial. Sixty-one adults from rural population, aged 20-45, with nsLBP or sciatica, and disc extrusions or bulges. Randomised to yoga (n=30) and control (n=31). Yoga: 3-month yoga course of group classes and home practice, designed to ensure safety for disc extrusions. CONTROL: normal medical care. OUTCOME MEASURES (3-4 months) Primary: Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ); worst pain in past two weeks. Secondary: Aberdeen Low Back Pain Scale; straight leg raise test; structural changes. RESULTS: Disc projections per case ranged from one bulge or one extrusion to three bulges plus two extrusions. Sixty-two percent had sciatica. Intention-to-treat analysis of the RMDQ data, adjusted for age, sex and baseline RMDQ scores, gave a Yoga Group score 3.29 points lower than Control Group (0.98, 5.61; p=0.006) at 3 months. No other significant differences in the endpoints occurred. No adverse effects of yoga were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga therapy can be safe and beneficial for patients with nsLBP or sciatica, accompanied by disc extrusions and bulges.

25268564	Underuse of yoga as a referral resource by health professions students.	OBJECTIVE: Nearly 38% of U.S. adults use complementary and alternative medicine approaches to manage physical conditions (e.g., chronic pain, arthritis, cancer, heart disease, and high blood pressure) and psychological or emotional health concerns (e.g., post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression). Research evidence has accumulated for yoga as an effective treatment approach for these conditions. Further, yoga has increased in popularity among healthcare providers and the general population. Given these trends, this study explored perceptions about yoga as a viable complementary treatment to which health professions students would refer patients. PARTICIPANTS: More than 1500 students enrolled in health professions programs at a Pacific Northwest school were enrolled; data were obtained from 478 respondents. DESIGN: The study assessed willingness to refer patients to yoga as a complementary and alternative medicine for 27 symptoms (identified in the literature as having evidence for yoga's utility), which were subsequently grouped into skeletal, physical, and psychological on the basis of factor analysis. Responses were assessed using a mixed-model analysis of variance with health profession and yoga practitioner as between-subjects variables and symptoms as a within-subjects factor. RESULTS: In descending order of likelihood to refer patients to yoga were students in occupational therapy, physician assistant program, psychology, physical therapy, pharmacy, dental hygiene, speech and audiology, and optometry. All groups perceived yoga's greatest utility for skeletal symptoms, followed by psychological and physical symptoms. Findings also revealed a significant positive relationship between level of personal yoga practice and willingness to refer patients to yoga. CONCLUSIONS: Although students expressed some openness to referring patients to yoga, ratings of appropriateness were not accurately aligned with extant evidence base. Personal experience seemed to be a salient factor for accepting yoga as a referral target. These findings suggest the importance of developing strategies to make health professionals more aware of the merits of yoga, regardless of whether they themselves are yoga practitioners.

26692742	Beliefs, attitudes and self-use of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy medicines among senior pharmacy students: An exploratory insight from Andhra Pradesh, India.	OBJECTIVES: To assess the beliefs, attitudes and self-use of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy (AYUSH) medicines among senior pharmacy students. METHODOLOGY: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted among pharmacy students in four pharmacy schools located in Andhra Pradesh in South India. This study was conducted from the August to September 2014. The study population included all pharmacy students enrolled in Doctor of Pharmacy, Bachelor of Pharmacy and Diploma in Pharmacy programs in studied pharmacy schools. The pretested AYUSH survey had 8 questions on AYUSH related beliefs and 8 question on AYUSH related attitudes. The survey also asked participants about AYUSH related knowledge, frequency of use of AYUSH and the reason for using AYUSH. The data analysis was performed using SPSS Version 20. Chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U-test were employed to study the association between the independent and dependent variables. RESULTS: A total of 428 pharmacy students participated in the survey. 32.2% of the study population was females and 32.5% of the population resided in rural areas. Males were more likely to have positive beliefs about AYUSH when compared to females (odd ratio [OR] = 4.62, confidence interval [CI] = 2.37-8.99, P < 0.001). Similarly, students living in hostels were more positive in their beliefs about AYUSH compared with students living at home (OR = 2.14, CI = 1.12-4.07, P < 0.05). Students living in hostel also had a positive attitude about AYUSH use (OR = 1.74, CI = 1.03-2.93, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Pharmacy students held favorable attitude and beliefs about AYUSH use. This baseline survey provides important information about the pharmacy student's perception about AYUSH. Further research is needed to explore the reasons that shape the pharmacy student's beliefs and attitudes about AYUSH.

25258446	An active learning complementary and alternative medicine session in a self-care therapeutics class.	OBJECTIVE: To provide an interactive, non-supplement based complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) session in a self-care therapeutics class and to evaluate the effect of the session on pharmacy students' perceptions and knowledge of CAM. DESIGN: Second professional year pharmacy students enrolled in a required 3-credit course titled Self-Care Therapeutics participated in an active learning session on CAM. Students physically engaged in 5 separate active learning CAM sessions including massage therapy, Tai Chi, yoga, progressive muscle relaxation, and Reiki. ASSESSMENT: Students were assessed on both knowledge and perception of CAM. Concept mastery was assessed using a written examination and individual readiness assurance tests (iRAT) and team readiness assurance tests (tRAT). Perception of CAM was measured using both a presession and a postsession survey. CONCLUSION: Participating in an intensive, active learning CAM session provided an opportunity to increase students' knowledge of CAM and an effective strategy for providing the learner with the experience to better envision incorporation into patient therapies.

25254284		Patient-centered care supports the active involvement of patients and their families in the decision-making process between options for treatment. Part of this mission is to identify, develop, and implement new practices and approaches that are found to be effective in promoting the transformation to a patient-centered model and improved patient care. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) strategies such as yoga are widely available in the private sector, and some Veterans would like access to these strategies through the Veterans Affairs (VA) system. Determining the state of evidence on the benefits and harms of yoga and other CAM modalities is a priority for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). To fulfill the joint research needs of the Office of Patient Centered Care and the Field Advisory Committee on Complementary and Alternative Medicine, and to help VA leadership determine the most appropriate guidelines/policy for the implementation of CAM therapies within the VA, the Evidence-based Synthesis Program Coordinating Center proposed a CAM evidence mapping project to evaluate the existing evidence on yoga for common clinical conditions in Veterans.

25253113	Exploring different types of Hatha yoga for patients with cancer.	Yoga has been practiced for more than 5,000 years and is based on the collective experiences of yoga practitioners over time. Western countries and sophisticated medical facilities use this practice as a complementary therapy with standard medical treatments. Yoga has been shown to improve quality of life. Several types of yoga potentially can benefit people with cancer, including Hatha yoga. The type of recommended Hatha yoga is dependent on the physical conditions and fitness level of patients. This article explores the impact of different types of Hatha yoga on various cancer-related symptoms in patients with cancer. The article also provides guidelines for healthcare personnel-particularly nurses-to help choose the right kind of Hatha yoga that suits their patients' needs and interests. Additional information is provided on measures and instructions that are essential for healthcare providers to know before recommending any yoga type to their patients. Evidence of the feasibility and potential efficacy of yoga for patients with cancer is provided.	Subedi, Sunita	2014 Oct
25241756	Protocol to evaluate the impact of yoga supplementation on cognitive function in schizophrenia: a randomised controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia (SZ) is a chronic illness that is treated symptomatically. Cognitive dysfunction is a core feature of SZ that is relatively intractable to pharmacotherapy. Yoga can improve cognitive function among healthy individuals. A recent open trial indicated significant benefits of yoga training (YT) in conjunction with conventional pharmacotherapy among patients with SZ. AIMS: To describe the protocol for an ongoing randomised controlled trial designed to test whether the reported beneficial effects of YT on cognitive function among SZ patients can be replicated. Secondarily, the effects of YT on daily functioning living skills are evaluated. METHODS: Consenting patients with SZ receive routine clinical treatment and are randomised to adjunctive YT, adjunctive physical exercise (PE) or treatment as usual (proposed N = 234 total, N = 78 in each group). The trial involves YT or PE 5 days a week and lasts 3 weeks. Participants are evaluated thrice over 6 months. Cognitive functions measured by Trail Making Test, University of Pennsylvania Neurocognitive Computerised Battery were primary outcome measures while clinical severity and daily functioning measured by Independent Living Skills Survey were secondary outcome measures. RESULTS: A total of 309 participants have been randomised as of 31 August 2013, which exceeded beyond 294 proposed after attrition. Once participants begin YT or PE they generally complete the protocol. No injuries have been reported. CONCLUSIONS: Short term YT is feasible and acceptable to Indian SZ patients. If beneficial effects of YT are detected, it will provide a novel adjunctive cognitive remediation strategy for SZ patients.

25230560	Is complementary and alternative medicine effective in job satisfaction among dentists with musculoskeletal disorders? A cross sectional study.	BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal disorders have serious impact on the profession of dentistry. There is common occurrence of pain due to incorrect posture in dental professionals. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies may cast a new light on preventing and intercepting musculoskeletal disorders (MSD). An epidemiological study was conducted in an effort to contribute to the prevention of musculoskeletal disorders in dentistry. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of MSD at dentists using CAM as a treatment and preventive modality for MSD and to compare job/career satisfaction between dentists who use CAM and conventional therapy (CT). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Dentists registered in Uttrakhand state, India, under the Dental Council of India and registered members of the Indian Dental Association, Uttrakhand branch (N = 1496) were surveyed. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 17. RESULTS: A response rate of 84% (N = 1257) was obtained, revealing that 90% (N = 1131) had the problem of MSD. Seventy three percentage (N = 826) of dentists with MSD reported the use of CAM and CT. Complementary and alternative medicine users reported greater overall health (72.7% vs. 51%, p < 0.001), job satisfaction (61.2% vs. 35%, p < 0.001) and work efficiency compared to CT users. CONCLUSION: Complementary and alternative medicine therapies may improve quality of life, reduce work interruption and enhance job satisfaction for dentists who suffers from MSD. Through the course of their studies, dentists should be equipped with knowledge on ergonomics and CAM therapies, such as yoga and others, to help them prevent musculoskeletal disorders more effectively.

25226195	Self-reported benefits and risks of yoga in individuals with bipolar disorder.	BACKGROUND: Although hatha yoga has frequently been recommended for patients with bipolar disorder (BD) and there is preliminary evidence that it alleviates depression, there are no published data on the benefits-and potential risks-of yoga for patients with BD. Thus, the goal of this study was to assess the risks and benefits of yoga in individuals with BD. METHODS: We recruited self-identified yoga practitioners with BD (N=109) to complete an Internet survey that included measures of demographic and clinical information and open-ended questions about yoga practice and the impact of yoga. RESULTS: 86 respondents provided sufficient information for analysis, 70 of whom met positive screening criteria for a lifetime history of mania or hypomania. The most common styles of yoga preferred were hatha and vinyasa. When asked what impact yoga had on their life, participants responded most commonly with positive emotional effects, particularly reduced anxiety, positive cognitive effects (e.g., acceptance, focus, or "a break from my thoughts"), or positive physical effects (e.g., weight loss, increased energy). Some respondents considered yoga to be significantly life changing. The most common negative effect of yoga was physical injury or pain. Five respondents gave examples of specific instances or a yoga practice that they believed increased agitation or manic symptoms; five respondents gave examples of times that yoga increased depression or lethargy. CONCLUSIONS: Many individuals who self-identify as having BD believe that yoga has benefits for mental health. However, yoga is not without potential risks. It is possible that yoga could serve as a useful adjunctive treatment for BD.	Uebelacker, Lisa A;Weinstock, Lauren M;Kraines, Morganne A	2014 Sep
25211372	The effect of a yoga intervention on alcohol and drug abuse risk in veteran and civilian women with posttraumatic stress disorder.	BACKGROUND: Individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often exhibit high-risk substance use behaviors. Complementary and alternative therapies are increasingly used for mental health disorders, although evidence is sparse. OBJECTIVES: Investigate the effect of a yoga intervention on alcohol and drug abuse behaviors in women with PTSD. Secondary outcomes include changes in PTSD symptom perception and management and initiation of evidence-based therapies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current investigation analyzed data from a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing a 12-session yoga intervention with an assessment control for women age 18 to 65 years with PTSD. The Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) and Drug Use Disorder Identification Test (DUDIT) were administered at baseline, after the intervention, and a 1-month follow-up. Linear mixed models were used to test the significance of the change in AUDIT and DUDIT scores over time. Treatment-seeking questions were compared by using Fisher exact tests. RESULTS: The mean AUDIT and DUDIT scores decreased in the yoga group; in the control group, mean AUDIT score increased while mean DUDIT score remained stable. In the linear mixed models, the change in AUDIT and DUDIT scores over time did not differ significantly by group. Most yoga group participants reported a reduction in symptoms and improved symptom management. All participants expressed interest in psychotherapy for PTSD, although only two participants, both in the yoga group, initiated therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this pilot study suggest that a specialized yoga therapy may play a role in attenuating the symptoms of PTSD, reducing risk of alcohol and drug use, and promoting interest in evidence-based psychotherapy. Further research is needed to confirm and evaluate the strength of these effects.	Reddy, Shivani;Dick, Alexandra M;Gerber, Megan R;Mitchell, Karen	2014 Oct

25191250	The development of an RDoC-based treatment program for adolescent depression: "Training for Awareness, Resilience, and Action" (TARA).	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the current leading causes of disability worldwide. Adolescence is a vulnerable period for the onset of depression, with MDD affecting 8-20% of all youth. Traditional treatment methods have not been sufficiently effective to slow the increasing prevalence of adolescent depression. We therefore propose a new model for the treatment of adolescent depression - Training for Awareness, Resilience, and Action (TARA) - that is based on current understanding of developmental and depression neurobiology. The TARA model is aligned with the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) of the National Institute of Mental Health. In this article, we first address the relevance of RDoC to adolescent depression. Second, we identify the major RDoC domains of function involved in adolescent depression and organize them in a way that gives priority to domains thought to be driving the psychopathology. Third, we select therapeutic training strategies for TARA based on current scientific evidence of efficacy for the prioritized domains of function in a manner that maximizes time, resources, and feasibility. The TARA model takes into consideration the developmental limitation in top-down cognitive control in adolescence and promotes bottom-up strategies such as vagal afference to decrease limbic hyperactivation and its secondary effects. The program has been informed by mindfulness-based therapy and yoga, as well as modern psychotherapeutic techniques. The treatment program is semi-manualized, progressive, and applied in a module-based approach designed for a group setting that is to be conducted one session per week for 12 weeks. We hope that this work may form the basis for a novel and more effective treatment strategy for adolescent depression, as well as broaden the discussion on how to address this challenge.

25190368	Complementary/alternative and conventional medicine use amongst menopausal women: results from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health.	Large population-based studies of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and conventional medicine use amongst menopausal women are lacking. This study helps address this gap by analysing data from a nationally representative sample of 10011 Australian women aged 59-64 years. Overall, 39% of menopausal women consulted CAM practitioners, 75% used self-prescribed CAM, 95% consulted general practitioners (GP) and 50% consulted specialists during the previous year, and 12% were current hormone replacement therapy (HRT) users. Our findings suggest that CAM is a significant healthcare option utilized by women to treat menopausal symptoms, and so requires attention from GPs and specialists.

25185831	Additional benefit of yoga to standard lifestyle modification on blood pressure in prehypertensive subjects: a randomized controlled study.	High blood pressure (BP) is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease morbidity. Considering the growing evidence of nonpharmacological interventions in the management of high BP, we designed a randomized, parallel active-controlled study on the effect of yoga and standard lifestyle modification (LSM) on BP and heart rate in individuals with prehypertension (systolic BP 120-139 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP 80-89 mm Hg). Volunteers (20-60 years) of both genders without any known cardiovascular disease were randomized into either LSM group (n = 92) or LSM+yoga group (n = 92). Before the intervention, age, waist circumference, physical activity, BP and fasting plasma glucose and lipids were comparable between the groups. After 12 weeks of intervention, we observed a significant reduction in the BP and heart rate in both the groups. Further, the reduction in systolic BP was significantly more in LSM+yoga group (6 mm Hg) as compared with LSM group (4 mm Hg). In addition, 13 prehypertensives became normotensives in LSM+yoga group and four in LSM group. The results indicate efficacy of nonpharmacological intervention and the additional benefit of yoga to standard LSM. Further research in this field may add to the level of evidence on the benefit of yoga, in the reduction of BP in high BP subjects, in the scientific literature.

25183502	Hemodynamic effects of slow breathing: does the pattern matter beyond the rate?	PURPOSE: Patterned breathing allows standardized serial measurements of heart rate variability and baroreflex indices. The slow breathing augments these parameters, and regular exercises, including yoga breathing practices with even respiratory rates have long-term beneficial effects in cardiovascular diseases. The role of temporization of breathing phases, i.e. the ratio of expiration to inspiration, is not known. In order to characterize the hemodynamic and autonomic responses during varying breathing phases 27 volunteers performed three short breathing sessions at 6/minutes frequency with 5:5, 3:7 and 7:3 inspiration expiration ratios. RESULTS: The immediate responses in arterial pressure and heart rate were negligible. The time domain parameters of heart rate variability (SDRR, PNN50,RMSSD) increased significantly with patterned breathing. So did the spontaneous baroreflex gain of increasing sequences (up-BRS, from 12 +/- 7 to 17 +/- 10 ms/mmHg, p < 0.05), and the cross-spectral low frequency gain, the LFalpha (from 11 +/- 7 to 15 +/- 7 ms/mmHg, p < 0.05). None of these parameters differed significantly from each other while using any of tested inspiratory-expiratory patterns. CONCLUSION: The major determinant of autonomic responses induced by slow patterned breathing is the breathing rate itself. From our observations, it follows that slow breathing exercises performed either with diagnostic or therapeutic purpose could be simplified, allowing more extensive investigations.

25183419	Characteristics of randomized controlled trials of yoga: a bibliometric analysis.	BACKGROUND: A growing number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated the therapeutic value of yoga interventions. This bibliometric analysis aimed to provide a comprehensive review of the characteristics of the totality of available randomized yoga trials. METHODS: All RCTs of yoga were eligible. Medline/PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, IndMED, and the tables of content of yoga specialty journals not listed in medical databases were screened through February 2014. Bibliometric data, data on participants, and intervention were extracted and analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: Published between 1975 and 2014, a total of 366 papers were included, reporting 312 RCTs from 23 different countries with 22,548 participants. The median study sample size was 59 (range 8-410, interquartile range = 31, 93). Two hundred sixty-four RCTs (84.6%) were conducted with adults, 105 (33.7%) with older adults and 31 (9.9%) with children. Eighty-four RCTs (26.9%) were conducted with healthy participants. Other trials enrolled patients with one of 63 varied medical conditions; the most common being breast cancer (17 RCTs, 5.4%), depression (14 RCTs, 4.5%), asthma (14 RCTs, 4.5%) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (13 RCTs, 4.2%). Whilst 119 RCTs (38.1%) did not define the style of yoga used, 35 RCTs (11.2%) used Hatha yoga and 30 RCTs (9.6%) yoga breathing. The remaining 128 RCTs (41.0%) used 46 varied yoga styles, with a median intervention length of 9 weeks (range 1 day to 1 year; interquartile range = 5, 12). Two hundred and forty-four RCTs (78.2%) used yoga postures, 232 RCTs (74.4%) used breath control, 153 RCTs (49.0%) used meditation and 32 RCTs (10.3%) used philosophy lectures. One hundred and seventy-four RCTs (55.6%) compared yoga with no specific treatment; 21 varied control interventions were used in the remaining RCTs. CONCLUSIONS: This bibliometric analysis presents the most complete up-to-date overview on published randomized yoga trials. While the available research evidence is sparse for most conditions, there was a marked increase in published RCTs in recent years.	Cramer, Holger;Lauche, Romy;Dobos, Gustav	2014 Sep 2
25177555	Effect of yoga on oxidative stress in elderly with grade-I hypertension: a randomized controlled study.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Hypertension, especially in elderly is a strong risk factor for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Oxidative stress has been implicated as one of the underlying cause of hypertension. Yoga has been found to control hypertension in the elderly, but the underlying benefits of mechanism in relation to oxidative stress regulation remains unclear. The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of yoga on oxidative stress in elderly with Grade-I hypertension. METHODS: An open parallel-arm randomised controlled study was conducted at BLDE University's Shri B.M.Patil Medical College, Hospital and Research Centre, India on elderly male individuals with Grade-I hypertension (n=57, age 60-80 years). Study (Yoga) group was assigned for yoga intervention and control group for walking for one hour in the morning for six days in a week for three months under the supervision of yoga instructor and physical training instructor respectively. Serum malondialdehyde (MDA) as an indicator of oxidative stress and antioxidants such as serum superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH) and vitamin C levels were estimated. RESULTS: Yoga practice for three months has significantly reduced serum MDA level (p<0.001), and enhanced antioxidants level such as SOD activity (p=0.007), serum GSH (p=0.002) and vitamin C (p=0.002). In the control group, we observed a significant increase in serum MDA level (p=0.04) and reduction in serum vitamin C level (p=0.015) with no significant difference in the SOD activity and GSH level. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that yoga is an effective means to reduce oxidative stress and to improve antioxidant defense in elderly hypertensive individuals.

25173169	In vitro detection of residual undifferentiated cells in retinal pigment epithelial cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells.	Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) such as human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are a leading candidate for regenerative medicine/cell therapies because of their capacity for pluripotency and unlimited self-renewal. However, there are significant obstacles preventing the clinical use of hPSCs. A significant safety issues is the presence of residual undifferentiated cells that have the potential to form tumors in vivo. Here, we describe the highly sensitive qRT-PCR methods for detection of residual undifferentiated cells in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells derived from hiPSCs. qRT-PCR using probes and primers targeting LIN28A (LIN28) transcripts can detect residual undifferentiated cell levels as low as 0.002 % in hiPSC-derived RPE cells. We expect this method to contribute to process validation and quality control of hiPSC-derived cell therapy product.	Kuroda, Takuya;Yasuda, Satoshi;Sato, Yoji	2014
25158652	The physical activity preferences of gynecologic cancer survivors.	PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To identify physical activity (PA) preferences of gynecologic cancer survivors (GCSs) and to understand the reasons for them. DESIGN: Population-based, cross-sectional mailed survey and semistructured interviews with a subsample. SETTING: Nova Scotia, Canada. SAMPLE: 239 GCSs completed the survey, and 16 participated in an interview. METHODS: GCSs identified from a provincial cancer registry completed a questionnaire assessing PA preferences. Survey respondents were asked to participate in a substudy exploring PA preferences through a semistructured interview. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Self-reported PA and PA preferences. FINDINGS: Analyses indicated that participants were interested in a PA program. Interviews highlighted that PA counseling was highly desired and should include discussions about the benefits and appropriate amounts of PA, as well as available opportunities for PA. CONCLUSIONS: GCSs have preferences regarding characteristics of PA discussions and programs. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Oncology nurses are integral to the promotion of PA in GCSs. Providing oncology nurses with training opportunities to learn about PA for cancer survivors is an important consideration for cancer centers in ensuring a satisfactory experience for cancer survivors.

25158633	Breathing-based meditation decreases posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in U.S. military veterans: a randomized controlled longitudinal study.	Given the limited success of conventional treatments for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), investigations of alternative approaches are warranted. We examined the effects of a breathing-based meditation intervention, Sudarshan Kriya yoga, on PTSD outcome variables in U.S. male veterans of the Iraq or Afghanistan war. We randomly assigned 21 veterans to an active (n = 11) or waitlist control (n = 10) group. Laboratory measures of eye-blink startle and respiration rate were obtained before and after the intervention, as were self-report symptom measures; the latter were also obtained 1 month and 1 year later. The active group showed reductions in PTSD scores, d = 1.16, 95% CI [0.20, 2.04], anxiety symptoms, and respiration rate, but the control group did not. Reductions in startle correlated with reductions in hyperarousal symptoms immediately postintervention (r = .93, p < .001) and at 1-year follow-up (r = .77, p = .025). This longitudinal intervention study suggests there may be clinical utility for Sudarshan Kriya yoga for PTSD.

25153750	Influence of yoga on body image satisfaction in men.	The aim of this study was to examine the influence of yoga practice on body image satisfaction in men. Male Figure Drawings were used to explore body image satisfaction in yoga beginners (n = 26, M age = 40.3 yr., SD = 11.6), experienced yoga practitioners (n = 22, M age = 46.4 yr., SD = 11.6), and non-yoga practicing aerobic and weight training exercisers (n = 34, M age = 41.2 yr., SD = 11.9). Satisfaction was significantly higher among the yoga groups than the exercisers. There was no statistical difference between the body satisfaction scores of the experienced yoga group and the beginner yoga students. This may suggest that individuals drawn to yoga have greater body satisfaction than exercisers, and that regular yoga practice possibly further increases body satisfaction.	Flaherty, Mary	2014 Aug
25148571	The effects of a therapeutic yoga program on postural control, mobility, and gait speed in community-dwelling older adults.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of a 12-week therapeutic yoga program on gait speed, postural control, and mobility in community-dwelling older adults. DESIGN: Quasi-experimental study with a pretest/post-test design. Researchers evaluated changes over time (pretest to post-test) in all outcome measures. Paired t-tests were used to analyze normal and fast gait speed, Timed Up and Go test, and Timed Up and Go Dual Task. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to evaluate scores for the Mini-BESTest (MBT). SETTING: Yoga classes were performed at a local senior center. Blind examiners who were previously trained in the outcome measures performed all pretests and post-tests at the site. PARTICIPANTS: Thirteen adults (12 women and 1 man, with a mean age+/-standard deviation of 72+/-6.9 years) completed the study. Research participants had minimal to no yoga experience. INTERVENTIONS: A 12-week, 60-minute, biweekly Kripalu yoga class designed specifically for community-dwelling older adults. OUTCOME MEASURES: Postural control (MBT), mobility (Timed Up and Go test), and gait speed (normal and fast) were assessed. RESULTS: All 13 participants attended at least 19 of the 24 classes (80% attendance). Statistically significant improvements were seen in the MBT (p=0.039), normal gait speed (p=0.015), fast gait speed (p=0.001), Timed Up and Go test (p=0.045), and Timed Up and Go Dual-Task (p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in postural control and mobility as measured by the MBT and Timed Up and Go gait as measured by fast gait speed indicate that research participants benefitted from the therapeutic yoga intervention. The yoga program designed for this study included activities in standing, sitting, and lying on the floor and may be effective in improving mobility, postural control, and gait speed in community-dwelling older adults.

25147479	A Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing the Impact of Yoga and Physical Education on the Emotional and Behavioural Functioning of Middle School Children.	BACKGROUND: Yoga programs geared for school children have become more widespread, but research regarding its impact on children is lacking. Several studies have reported positive outcomes, though there is a need for more randomised controlled trials. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of yoga on children's emotional and behavioural functioning when compared with physical education (PE) classes. METHODS: Thirty middle school children were randomised to participate in either a school-based Ashtanga-informed yoga or PE class three times a week for 12 weeks. Emotional (i.e. affect, self-perceptions) and behavioural (i.e. internalising and externalising problems, aggression) functioning were measured pre and post-intervention. RESULTS: There were no significant changes between groups in self-reported positive affect, global self-worth, aggression indices or parent reports of their children's externalising and internalising problems. However, negative affect increased for those children participating in yoga when compared to the PE program. CONCLUSIONS: In general, findings suggest that yoga and PE classes do not differentially impact on middle school children's emotional and behavioural functioning. However, children reported experiencing increased negative emotions after receiving yoga while children in the PE group reported a decrease in these feelings. Implications of these results and potential directions for future research on children's yoga are discussed.	Haden, Sara C;Daly, Leslie;Hagins, Marshall	2014 Sep 1
25146071	Muscle utilization patterns vary by skill levels of the practitioners across specific yoga poses (asanas).	OBJECTIVE: To compare muscle activation patterns in 14 dominant side muscles during different yoga poses across three skill levels. DESIGN: Mixed repeated-measures descriptive study. SETTING: University neuromuscular research laboratory, Miami, US. PARTICIPANTS: A group of 36 yoga practitioners (9 M/27 F; mean +/- SD, 31.6 +/- 12.6 years) with at least 3 months yoga practice experience. INTERVENTIONS: Each of the 11 surya namaskar poses A and B was performed separately for 15s and the surface electromyography for 14 muscles were recorded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Normalized root mean square of the electromyographic signal (NrmsEMG) for 14 muscles (5 upper body, 4 trunk, 5 lower body). RESULTS: There were significant main effects of pose for all fourteen muscles except middle trapezius (p<.02) and of skill level for the vastus medialis; p=.027). A significant skill level x pose interaction existed for five muscles (pectoralis major sternal head, anterior deltoid, medial deltoid, upper rectus abdominis and gastrocnemius lateralis; p<.05). Post hoc analyses using Bonferroni comparisons indicated that different poses activated specific muscle groups; however, this varied by skill level. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that different poses can produce specific muscle activation patterns which may vary due to practitioners' skill levels. This information can be used in designing rehabilitation and training programs and for cuing during yoga training.

25143922	Completion report: Effect of Comprehensive Yogic Breathing program on type 2 diabetes: A randomized control trial.	BACKGROUND: Yoga has been shown to be beneficial in diabetes in many studies, though randomized control trials are few. The aim of this randomized control trial was to see the effect of Sudarshan Kriya and related practices (comprehensive yogic breathing program) on quality of life, glycemic control, and cardiac autonomic functions in diabetes. Diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for sudden cardiac death. Cardiac autonomic neuropathy has been implicated in the causation of sudden cardiac death. Therefore, a maneuver to prevent progression of cardiac autonomic neuropathy holds significance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 120 patients of diabetes on oral medication and diet and exercise advice were randomized into two groups: (1) Continued to receive standard treatment for diabetes. (2) Patients administered comprehensive yogic breathing program and monitored to regularly practice yoga in addition to standard treatment of diabetes. At 6 months, quality of life and postprandial plasma glucose significantly improved in the group practicing yoga compared to baseline, but there was no significant improvement in the fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin. RESULTS: On per protocol analysis, sympathetic cardiac autonomic functions significantly improved from baseline in the group practicing comprehensive yogic breathing. CONCLUSION: This randomized control trial points towards the beneficial effect of yogic breathing program in preventing progression of cardiac neuropathy. This has important implications as cardiac autonomic neuropathy has been considered as one of the factors for sudden cardiac deaths.

25143234	A review of the clinical evidence for complementary and alternative therapies in Parkinson's disease.	OPINION STATEMENT: No conventional treatment has been convincingly demonstrated to slow or stop the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Dopaminergic therapy is the gold standard for managing the motor disability associated with PD, but it falls short of managing all of the aspects of the disease that contribute to quality of life. Perhaps for this reason, an increasing number of patients are searching for a more holistic approach to healthcare. This is not to say that they are abandoning the standard and effective symptomatic therapies for PD, but rather are complementing them with healthy living, mind-body practices, and natural products that empower patients to be active participants in their healthcare and widen the net under which disease modification might one day be achieved. Despite high rates of utilization of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practices, data on efficacy is generally limited, restricting physicians in providing guidance to interested patients. Exercise is now well-established as integral in the management of PD, but mind-body interventions such as Tai Chi that incorporate relaxation and mindfulness with physical activity should be routinely encouraged as well. While no comment can be made about neuroplastic or disease-modifying effects of mind-body interventions, patients should be encouraged to be as active as possible and engage with others in enjoyable and challenging activities such as dance, music therapy, and yoga. Many PD patients also choose to try herbs, vitamins, and neutraceuticals as part of a healthy lifestyle, with the added expectation that these products may lower free radical damage and protect them against further cell death. Evidence for neuroprotection is limited, but patients can be encouraged to maintain a healthy diet rich in "high-power," low-inflammatory foods, while at the same time receiving education that many promising natural products have produced disappointing results in clinical trials. It is vital that the science of holistic medicine reaches a point where all neutraceuticals are investigated with the same rigor as conventional drugs. A number of agents discussed here that have a proposed role in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (and PD in particular), including cannabis, mucuna pruriens, and Chinese herbals, deserve more attention from basic science researchers and clinical investigators before they can be either safely utilized or dismissed.

25141362	Use of movement therapies and relaxation techniques and management of health conditions among children.	CONTEXT: Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by children under 18 y of age in the United States is becoming more prevalent. According to an analysis of procedures in chiropractic practices in 2010, more than 96% of chiropractors in the United States recommended use of movement therapies (MT) and relaxation techniques (RT) to their patients. The extent of use of these methods as treatment options for specific health conditions in children, however, has been underexplored in the United States. OBJECTIVES: The current study assessed use of MT and RT in children for treatment of various health conditions, as reported in the 2007 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), and also examined variations in use across various sociodemographic categories. DESIGN: Secondary data from the 2007 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Child Alternative Medicine file were analyzed, and the research team generated weighted frequencies and inferential statistics. OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed through binary logistic regression to assess use of MT and RT as functions of various sociodemographic variables. RESULTS: Within the 12 mo prior to the survey, MT and RT use was reported by 2.5% and 2.9% of respondents, respectively. MT, primarily yoga, was used for the control and reduction of anxiety and stress (31.4%), asthma (16.2%), and back/neck pain (15.3%). Alternatively, RT, such as controlled breathing exercises (2.1%) and meditation (2.3%), was used for anxiety and stress (41.4%) and attention-deficit disorders (ADDs) (16.0%). Although data screening did not produce obvious predictors for RT use, age, gender, race/ethnicity, and parents' education levels were potential predictors of MT use. For example, respondents aged <10 y reported lower MT use than those >10 y (OR = 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3-0.6), and males reported lower MT use than females (OR = 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3-0.7). CONCLUSION: MT and RT are used by several million children in the United States each year. The current research suggests that early training on MT and RT can be seen as a useful tool that can help prevent or manage certain health problems. In addition to an examination of their role in primary prevention, the use of MT and RT should be explored further to determine how these therapies work with respect to specific health conditions.

25141359	The physiological responses to Bikram yoga in novice and experienced practitioners.	CONTEXT: Bikram yoga has gained a large following, possibly because of widespread claims boasting energy expenditure of up to 1000 calories per session. However, these claims are unfounded because no scientific study has investigated the metabolic response to a complete, standardized Bikram yoga class. OBJECTIVES: This study intends to determine energy expenditure, heart rate, and sweat rate in novice and experienced practitioners from a standardized Bikram yoga class. SETTING: Data were collected in the environmental chamber of the Exercise Physiology Laboratory at San Diego State University in California, USA. PARTICIPANTS: Male (n = 5) and female (n = 19) participants between the ages of 18 and 57 y were recruited through flyers in yoga studios throughout San Diego. Participants were classified as experienced or novice practitioners, having completed >/=20 or <20 sessions, respectively. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were guided through a standardized 90-min yoga class performed in a hot environment using Bikram's Standard Beginning Dialogue, while expired gas was collected and heart rate was recorded. OUTCOME MEASURES: Energy expenditure, calculated via oxygen uptake, and heart rate were determined for each posture and transition period. In addition, sweat rate and core temperature were recorded for each participant. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) relative VO2 for the entire 90-min session was 9.5 +/- 1.9 mL x kg-1 x min-1, ranging from 6.0 to 12.9 mL x kg-1 x min-1. Mean absolute energy expenditure was 286 +/- 72 kcals, ranging from 179 to 478 kcals. Independent sample t tests revealed significant differences (P < .05) in relative energy expenditure, heart rate, ending core temperature, and sweat rate between experience levels. Mean relative energy expenditure was 3.7 +/- 0.5 kcal/kg in novice practitioners and 4.7 +/- 0.8 kcal/kg in experienced practitioners. Percentage of predicted maximum heart rate and sweat rate were 72.3% +/- 10.6% and 0.6 +/- 0.2 kg/h in novice practitioners and 86.4% +/- 5.2% and 1.1 +/- 0.5 kg/h in experienced participants. All postures were classified as light-to-moderate intensity according to the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) standards. CONCLUSIONS: Bikram yoga meets requirements for exercise of light-to-moderate intensity and, theoretically, could be used for weight maintenance or weight loss if practiced several times per week.

25141355	Role of yoga and meditation in the context of dysfunctional self: a hypothetico-integrative approach.	Aaron T. Beck describes habitual patterns of schemas (ie, organized patterns of thought or behavior) as vital elements of emotional and behavioral experience, whereas biased processing of information accompanies psychopathological states. In this article, the authors propose a hypothetico-integrative approach to understanding the role of yoga and meditation. This approach is based on the background of Beck's model of the psychopathology of the dysfunctional self. The authors have found that the practices common to most forms of yoga and meditation are (1) focusing of attention; (2) creating a state of relaxation; and (3) developing mindfulness through efferent attenuation, sensory attenuation, and nonanalytic attention. Biological studies of meditation and yoga have found a tendency toward use of the relaxation response, the involvement of the attentional networks, and, likely, the cingulatecortex, particularly in the process of bare attention (ie, awareness without thought). This highest level of nonjudgmental awareness may help in obtaining a better-adjusted resilient self.	Singh, Yogesh;Goel, Arun;Kathrotia, Rajesh;Patil, Prashant M	2014 Summer
25137182	Yoga: a biobehavioral approach to reduce symptom distress in women with urge urinary incontinence.	Urge urinary incontinence is a debilitating chronic condition that poses challenges for affected women and the clinicians who care for them. Multicomponent behavioral therapies have shown promise in allowing women to manage their symptoms. New evidence suggests an underlying pathophysiologic inflammatory process for urge urinary incontinence, and complementary therapies that address the psychoneuroimmunology component may improve the health and quality of life for the millions of women with this condition. Yoga, a mind-body therapy, has been shown to reduce inflammation and may help improve symptoms of urge urinary incontinence. More research is necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of yoga to reduce urge urinary incontinence symptom burden and improve quality of life.	Tenfelde, Sandi;Janusek, Linda Witek	2014 Oct
25137078	Women's perspectives on falls and fall prevention during pregnancy.	BACKGROUND: Falls are the leading cause of unintentional injury in women. During pregnancy, even a minor fall can result in adverse consequences. Evidence to inform effective and developmentally appropriate pregnancy fall prevention programs is lacking. Early research on pregnancy fall prevention suggests that exercise may reduce falls. However, acceptability and effectiveness of pregnancy fall prevention programs are untested. PURPOSE: To better understand postpartum women's perspective and preferences on fall prevention strategies during pregnancy to formulate an intervention. METHODS: Focus groups and individual interviews were conducted with 31 postpartum women using descriptive qualitative methodology. Discussion of falls during pregnancy and fall prevention strategies was guided by a focus group protocol and enhanced by 1- to 3-minute videos on proposed interventions. Focus groups were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using NVivo 10 software. RESULTS: Emerging themes were environmental circumstances and physical changes of pregnancy leading to a fall, prevention strategies, barriers, safety concerns, and marketing a fall prevention program. Wet surfaces and inappropriate footwear commonly contributed to falls. Women preferred direct provider counseling and programs including yoga and Pilates. IMPLICATIONS: Fall prevention strategies tailored to pregnant women are needed. Perspectives of postpartum women support fall prevention through provider counseling and individual or supervised exercise programs.	Brewin, Dorothy;Naninni, Angela	2014 Sep-Oct
25132206	Randomized controlled pilot study of mindfulness-based stress reduction for persistently fatigued cancer survivors.	OBJECTIVE: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is one of the most common, persistent, and disabling symptoms associated with cancer and its treatment. Evidence-based treatments that are acceptable to patients are critically needed. This study examined the efficacy of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) for CRF and related symptoms. METHOD: A sample of 35 cancer survivors with clinically significant CRF was randomly assigned to a 7-week MBSR-based intervention or wait-list control group. The intervention group received training in mindfulness meditation, yoga, and self-regulatory responses to stress. Fatigue interference (primary outcome) and a variety of secondary outcomes (e.g., fatigue severity, vitality, disability, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance) were assessed at baseline, post-intervention, and 1-month follow-up. Bonferroni correction was employed to account for multiple comparisons. Controls received the intervention after the 1-month follow-up. Participants in both groups were followed for 6 months after completing their respective MBSR courses to assess maintenance of effects. RESULTS: Compared to controls, the MBSR group reported large post-intervention reductions as assessed by effect sizes (d) in the primary outcome, fatigue interference (d = -1.43, p < 0.001), along with fatigue severity (d = -1.55, p < 0.001), vitality (d = 1.29, p < 0.001), depression (d = -1.30, p < 0.001), and sleep disturbance (d = -0.74, p = 0.001). Results were maintained or strengthened at 1-month follow-up, the point at which significant improvements in disability (d = -1.22, p < 0.002) and anxiety (d = -0.98, p = 0.002) occurred. Improvements in all outcomes were maintained 6 months after completing the course. MBSR adherence was high, with 90% attendance across groups and high rates of participant-reported home practice of mindfulness. CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness-based stress reduction is a promising treatment for CRF and associated symptoms.

25130139	Barriers and facilitators to yoga use in a population of individuals with self-reported chronic low back pain: a qualitative approach.	Yoga has been found to be efficacious in treating chronic low back pain, yet biomedical treatments are most commonly used for pain. Promoting yoga as part of integrative care would reduce exclusive reliance on high-cost, higher-risk biomedical treatments. Attitudes toward yoga play a role in consideration of it as a treatment. The current study examined attitudes toward yoga in adults with chronic low back pain and compared these results to those found in a 2009 general population study. Participants completed a semi-structured interview where they responded to items about perceptions of potential barriers and facilitators to trying yoga. Participant responses were analyzed qualitatively and several common themes emerged. Themes identified by participants indicated there is mixed information about yoga in the public domain and that clarification of what yoga is, how it can be beneficial, and what it requires one to do physically may help promote its use.

25129883	Trauma-sensitive yoga as an adjunct mental health treatment in group therapy for survivors of domestic violence: a feasibility study.	This study is a feasibility test of whether incorporating trauma-sensitive yoga into group therapy for female victims of partner violence improves symptoms of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) beyond that achieved with group therapy alone. Seventeen (9 control, 8 intervention) adult female clients seeking group psychotherapy were enrolled. A 12-week trauma-sensitive yoga protocol was administered once weekly for 30-40 min at the end of each group therapy session. The control group received typical group psychotherapy. Feasibility was assessed through recruitment and retention rates as well as participants' self-reported perceptions of the safety and utility of the study. The study enrolled 85% (17/20) of those screened eligible. Loss to follow-up was 30% (5/17). No one reported emotional or physical harm. All of the respondents reported that the study was personally meaningful and that the results would be useful to others.

25127084	Effect of restorative yoga vs. stretching on diurnal cortisol dynamics and psychosocial outcomes in individuals with the metabolic syndrome: the PRYSMS randomized controlled trial.	PURPOSE: Chronic stimulation and dysregulation of the neuroendocrine system by stress may cause metabolic abnormalities. We estimated how much cortisol and psychosocial outcomes improved with a restorative yoga (relaxation) versus a low impact stretching intervention for individuals with the metabolic syndrome. METHODS: We conducted a 1-year multi-center randomized controlled trial (6-month intervention and 6-month maintenance phase) of restorative yoga vs. stretching. Participants completed surveys to assess depression, social support, positive affect, and stress at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. For each assessment, we collected saliva at four points daily for three days and collected response to dexamethasone on the fourth day for analysis of diurnal cortisol dynamics. We analyzed our data using multivariate regression models, controlling for study site, medications (antidepressants, hormone therapy), body mass index, and baseline cortisol values. RESULTS: Psychosocial outcome measures were available for 171 study participants at baseline, 140 at 6 months, and 132 at 1 year. Complete cortisol data were available for 136 of 171 study participants (72 in restorative yoga and 64 in stretching) and were only available at baseline and 6 months. At 6 months, the stretching group had decreased cortisol at waking and bedtime compared to the restorative yoga group. The pattern of changes in stress mirrored this improvement, with the stretching group showing reductions in chronic stress severity and perseverative thoughts about their stress. Perceived stress decreased by 1.5 points (-0.4; 3.3, p=0.11) at 6 months, and by 2.0 points (0.1; 3.9, p=0.04) at 1 year in the stretching compared to restorative yoga groups. Post hoc analyses suggest that in the stretching group only, perceived increases in social support (particularly feelings of belonging), but not changes in stress were related to improved cortisol dynamics. CONCLUSIONS: We found significant decreases in salivary cortisol, chronic stress severity, and stress perception in the stretching group compared to the restorative yoga group. Group support during the interactive stretch classes may have contributed to these changes.

25120574	Effect of yoga on pain, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and serotonin in premenopausal women with chronic low back pain.	Background. Serotonin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are known to be modulators of nociception. However, pain-related connection between yoga and those neuromodulators has not been investigated. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effect of yoga on pain, BDNF, and serotonin. Methods. Premenopausal women with chronic low back pain practiced yoga three times a week for 12 weeks. At baseline and after 12 weeks, back pain intensity was measured using visual analogue scale (VAS), and serum BDNF and serotonin levels were evaluated. Additionally, back flexibility and level of depression were assessed. Results. After 12-week yoga, VAS decreased in the yoga group (P < 0.001), whereas it increased (P < 0.05) in the control group. Back flexibility was improved in the yoga group (P < 0.01). Serum BDNF increased in the yoga group (P < 0.01), whereas it tended to decrease in the control group (P = 0.05). Serum serotonin maintained in the yoga group, while it reduced (P < 0.01) in the control group. The depression level maintained in the yoga group, whereas it tended to increase in the control group (P = 0.07). Conclusions. We propose that BDNF may be one of the key factors mediating beneficial effects of yoga on chronic low back pain.	Lee, Moseon;Moon, Woongjoon;Kim, Jaehee	2014
25111109	The effect of yoga exercise on improving depression, anxiety, and fatigue in women with breast cancer: a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Depression, anxiety, and fatigue are among the most significant problems that influence the quality of life of patients with breast cancer who receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Although evidence has shown yoga to decrease anxiety, depression, and fatigue in patients with cancer, few studies on the effects of yoga have targeted patients with breast cancer. Yoga interventions should be tested to promote the psychological and physical health of women with breast cancer. PURPOSE: This study examines the effectiveness of an 8-week yoga exercise program in promoting the psychological and physical health of women with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy in terms of depression, anxiety, and fatigue. METHODS: A sample of 60 women with nonmetastatic breast cancer was recruited. Participants were randomly assigned into either the experimental group (n = 30) or the control group (n = 30). A 60-minute, twice-per-week yoga exercise was implemented for 8 weeks as the intervention for the participants in the experimental group. The control group received standard care only. RESULTS: Analysis using the Johnson-Neyman procedure found that the yoga exercise reduced overall fatigue and the interference of fatigue in everyday life for the experimental group participants. Significant reductions were obtained after 4 weeks of intervention participation for those experimental group patients with relatively low starting baseline values (baseline item mean value < 3.31 and 3.22, respectively) and after 8 weeks for most patients (approximately 75%) with moderate starting baseline values (baseline item mean value < 7.30 and 5.34, respectively). The 8-week intervention did not significantly improve the levels of depression (F = 1.29, p > .05) or anxiety (F = 2.7, p > .05). CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The 8-week yoga exercise program developed in this study effectively reduced fatigue in patients with breast cancer but did not reduce depression or anxiety. Oncology nurses should strengthen their clinical health education and apply yoga to reduce the fatigue experienced by patients with breast cancer who undergo adjuvant chemotherapy.

25109716	Obesity-related inflammation & cardiovascular disease: efficacy of a yoga-based lifestyle intervention.	Obesity is a global health burden and its prevalence is increasing substantially due to changing lifestyle. Chronic adiposity is associated with metabolic imbalance leading to dyslipidaemia, diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Adipose tissue acts as an endocrine organ releasing several adipocytokines, and is associated with increased levels of tissue and circulating inflammatory biomolecules causing vascular inflammation and atherogenesis. Further, inflammation is also associated independently with obesity as well as CVD. Keeping this in view, it is possible that a reduction in weight may lead to a decrease in inflammation, resulting in CVD risk reduction, and better management of patients with CVD. Lifestyle intervention has been endorsed by several health authorities in prevention and management of chronic diseases. A yoga-based lifestyle intervention appears to be a promising option in reducing the risk for CVD as well as management of patients with CVD as it is simple to follow and cost-effective with high compliance. The efficacy of such lifestyle intervention programmes is multifaceted, and is achieved via reduction in weight, obesity-related inflammation and stress, thereby culminating into risk reduction towards several chronic diseases including CVD. In this review, the association between obesity-related inflammation and CVD, and the role of yoga-based lifestyle intervention in prevention and management of CVD are discussed.

25105073	Acupuncture and meditation for military veterans: first steps of quality management and future program development.	Veterans of all war eras have a high rate of chronic disease, mental health disorders, and chronic multi-symptom illnesses (CMI).(1-3) Many veterans report symptoms that affect multiple biological systems as opposed to isolated disease states. Standard medical treatments often target isolated disease states such as headaches, insomnia, or back pain and at times may miss the more complex, multisystem dysfunction that has been documented in the veteran population. Research has shown that veterans have complex symptomatology involving physical, cognitive, psychological, and behavioral disturbances, such as difficult to diagnose pain patterns, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, or neurocognitive dysfunction.(2-4) Meditation and acupuncture are each broad-spectrum treatments designed to target multiple biological systems simultaneously, and thus, may be well suited for these complex chronic illnesses. The emerging literature indicates that complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) approaches augment standard medical treatments to enhance positive outcomes for those with chronic disease, mental health disorders, and CMI.(5-12.)

25100495	Assessing fidelity of core components in a mindfulness and yoga intervention for urban youth: applying the CORE Process.	In the past years, the number of mindfulness-based intervention and prevention programs has increased steadily. In order to achieve the intended program outcomes, program implementers need to understand the essential and indispensable components that define a program's success. This chapter describes the complex process of identifying the core components of a mindfulness and yoga program for urban early adolescents through the systematic study of fidelity of implementation of the intervention. The authors illustrate the CORE Process [(C) Conceptualize Core Components; (O) Operationalize and measure; (R) Run analyses and Review implementation findings; and (E) Enhance and refine], based on data gained from a mindfulness and yoga intervention study conducted as a community-academic partnership in Baltimore city.

25078040	Complementary and alternative medicine use at a single pediatric inflammatory bowel disease center.	The aim of this study was to determine the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in an inflammatory bowel disease population at a single pediatric center. The secondary aims were to determine predictors of CAM use and assess parental attitude to CAM use. A survey was developed that was distributed electronically and given out in the clinic. Two hundred thirty-five surveys were analyzed. Thirty-six percent of respondents reported that their children had used CAM, while 19.6% were current users. Sixty-three percent of respondents were "extremely" or "very supportive" of CAM and 57.6% would have been "extremely" or "very supportive" at the time of their children's diagnosis. The most commonly used CAM modalities were fish oil (48.8%), probiotics (22.5%), acupuncture/pressure (17.5%), aloe (16.3%), yoga/meditation (16.3%), chiropractic (12%), and herbal medicine (13.8%). Multivariate analysis revealed 2 independent factors predictive of subjects using CAM: use of biologics (odds ratio of 2.8; p = .008) and subjects' parent using CAM (odds ratio of 10.9; p </= .001). More than one third of children in this study and their parents have used CAM. Families are supportive of CAM both at the time of diagnosis and as an ongoing component of their child's treatment even if they were not past or current users of CAM. Predictors of CAM use were treatment with a biologic and having a parent who used CAM.	Ceballos, Clare;Bao, Ruijun;Dunkin, David;Song, Ying;Li, Xiu-Min;Benkov, Keith	2014 Jul-Aug
25077732	New perspectives on patient expectations of treatment outcomes: results from qualitative interviews with patients seeking complementary and alternative medicine treatments for chronic low back pain.	BACKGROUND: Positive patient expectations are often believed to be associated with greater benefits from complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments. However, clinical studies of CAM treatments for chronic pain have not consistently supported this assumption, possibly because of differences in definitions and measures of expectations. The goal of this qualitative paper is to provide new perspectives on the outcome expectations of patients prior to receiving CAM therapies for chronic low back pain. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 64 individuals receiving massage, chiropractic, acupuncture or yoga for chronic low back pain. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Transcripts were analyzed by a team of experienced qualitative researchers using an immersion/crystallization approach to coding and analysis. RESULTS: Overall, participants' expectations of treatment outcomes tended to cluster in four key domains: pain relief, improved function (including an increase in ability to engage in meaningful activities), improved physical fitness, and improved overall well-being (including mental well-being). Typically, patients had modest expectations for outcomes from treatment. Furthermore, outcome expectations were complex on several levels. First, the concept of expectations overlapped with several related concepts; in particular, hopes. Participants sometimes used expectations and hopes interchangeably and at other times made clear distinctions between these two terms depending on context. A related finding was that participants were cautious about stating that they expected positive outcomes. Finally, participants articulated strong interrelationships among the four key domains and often discussed how changes in one domain might affect other domains. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings contribute to a growing body of literature exploring the role of expectations in patient outcomes. This paper provides important guidance that may help refine the way treatment expectations are studied in the future. In particular, participants' statements indicate that standardized measures of patient expectations should include items that capture hesitancy to articulate overly optimistic outcomes as well as interrelationships among different outcomes.

25066942	Rusie Dutton traditional Thai exercise promotes health related physical fitness and quality of life in menopausal women.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of "Rusie Dutton" on health and quality of life in menopausal women. METHOD: Menopausal women (aged 45-59) were recruited and randomly allocated to 2 groups. Rusie Dutton group (n = 24) practiced Rusie Dutton conducted by Wat Pho Thai Traditional Massage School for 13 weeks. The control group (n = 26) was assigned to a waiting list and received no intervention. BW, BMI, restingHR, BP, flexibility, VO2max, and MENQOL including vasomotor, physical, psychosocial and sexual domains were measured at the beginning and the end. A paired-sample t-test and independent sample t-test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Significant improvement was found in all variables within group (p < .05) in Rusie Dutton group, and a significant difference between groups was found (p < .05) in all variables except BW and BMI. Therefore, it is concluded that the traditional Thai exercise Rusie Dutton can promote health related physical fitness and QOL in menopausal women.

25055894	The influence of tai chi and yoga on balance and falls in a residential care setting: a randomised controlled trial.	Abstract Falls amongst older people is a global public health concern. Whilst falling is not a typical feature of ageing, older people are more likely to fall. Fall injuries amongst older people are a leading cause of death and disability. Many older people do not do regular exercise so that they lose muscle tone, strength, and flexibility which affect balance and predispose them to falls. The management of falls in residential care settings is a major concern with strategies for prevention and monitoring a focus in this setting. Yoga and tai chi have shown potential to improve balance and prevent falls in older adults. They also have potential to improve pain and quality of life. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of conducting a 3-arm RCT with frail older people in a residential care setting to test the hypothesis that a 14 week modified tai chi or yoga program is more effective than usual care activity in improving balance function, quality of life, pain experience and in reducing number of falls. There were no statistically significant differences between the three groups in the occurrence of falls. Yoga demonstrated a slight decrease in fall incidence; quality of life improved for the tai chi group. Only the yoga group experienced a reduction in average pain scores though not statistically significant. The findings of the study suggest it is possible to safely implement modified yoga and tai chi in a residential care setting and evaluate this using RCT design. They show positive changes to balance, pain and quality of life and a high level of interest through attendance amongst the older participants. The results support offering tai chi and yoga to older people who are frail and dependent with physical and cognitive limitations.

25053754	Mindfulness-based stress reduction as a stress management intervention for healthy individuals: a systematic review.	Stress is a global public health problem with several negative health consequences, including anxiety, depression, cardiovascular disease, and suicide. Mindfulness-based stress reduction offers an effective way of reducing stress by combining mindfulness meditation and yoga in an 8-week training program. The purpose of this study was to look at studies from January 2009 to January 2014 and examine whether mindfulness-based stress reduction is a potentially viable method for managing stress. A systematic search from Medline, CINAHL, and Alt HealthWatch databases was conducted for all types of quantitative articles involving mindfulness-based stress reduction. A total of 17 articles met the inclusion criteria. Of the 17 studies, 16 demonstrated positive changes in psychological or physiological outcomes related to anxiety and/or stress. Despite the limitations of not all studies using randomized controlled design, having smaller sample sizes, and having different outcomes, mindfulness-based stress reduction appears to be a promising modality for stress management.

25042310	The effects of selected asanas in Iyengar yoga on flexibility: pilot study.	In recent years the practice of yoga has gained popularity as a form of physical fitness and exercise, and has been said to improve strength and flexibility. The main objective of this research project was to evaluate the effects of a six week Iyengar yoga intervention on flexibility. N = 16 low to moderately active females (52.37 +/- 7.79 years) attended Iyengar yoga practice for a total of 6 weeks, consisting of one 90 min session per week. Lumbar and hamstring flexibility were assessed pre and post-intervention using a standard sit and reach test. The results show a significant increase in flexibility, indicating 6 weeks of single session yoga training may be effective in increasing erector spinae and hamstring flexibility. This is important when considering that much of the population find it difficult to attend more than one session a week into their training schedule.	Amin, Daniel James;Goodman, Maureen	2014 Jul
25041058	Meditation for migraines: a pilot randomized controlled trial.	OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess the safety, feasibility, and effects of the standardized 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) course in adults with migraines. BACKGROUND: Stress is a well-known trigger for headaches. Research supports the general benefits of mind/body interventions for migraines, but there are few rigorous studies supporting the use of specific standardized interventions. MBSR is a standardized 8-week mind/body intervention that teaches mindfulness meditation/yoga. Preliminary research has shown MBSR to be effective for chronic pain syndromes, but it has not been evaluated for migraines. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 19 episodic migraineurs randomized to either MBSR (n = 10) or usual care (n = 9). Our primary outcome was change in migraine frequency from baseline to initial follow-up. Secondary outcomes included change in headache severity, duration, self-efficacy, perceived stress, migraine-related disability/impact, anxiety, depression, mindfulness, and quality of life from baseline to initial follow-up. RESULTS: MBSR was safe (no adverse events), with 0% dropout and excellent adherence (daily meditation average: 34 +/- 11 minutes, range 16-50 minutes/day). Median class attendance from 9 classes (including retreat day) was 8 (range [3, 9]); average class attendance was 6.7 +/- 2.5. MBSR participants had 1.4 fewer migraines/month (MBSR: 3.5 to 1.0 vs control: 1.2 to 0 migraines/month, 95% confidence interval CI [-4.6, 1.8], P = .38), an effect that did not reach statistical significance in this pilot sample. Headaches were less severe, although not significantly so (-1.3 points/headache on 0-10 scale, [-2.3, 0.09], P = .053) and shorter (-2.9 hours/headache, [-4.6, -0.02], P = .043) vs control. Migraine Disability Assessment and Headache Impact Test-6 dropped in MBSR vs control (-12.6, [-22.0, -1.0], P = .017 and -4.8, [-11.0, -1.0], P = .043, respectively). Self-efficacy and mindfulness improved in MBSR vs control (13.2 [1.0, 30.0], P = .035 and 13.1 [3.0, 26.0], P = .035 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: MBSR is safe and feasible for adults with migraines. Although the small sample size of this pilot trial did not provide power to detect statistically significant changes in migraine frequency or severity, secondary outcomes demonstrated this intervention had a beneficial effect on headache duration, disability, self-efficacy, and mindfulness. Future studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to further evaluate this intervention for adults with migraines. This study was prospectively registered (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01545466).	Wells, Rebecca Erwin;Burch, Rebecca;Paulsen, Randall H;Wayne, Peter M;Houle, Timothy T;Loder, Elizabeth	2014 Oct

25036466	A holistic antenatal model based on yoga, Ayurveda, and Vedic guidelines.	The prevalence of pregnancy complications are on the rise globally with severe consequences. According to the World Health Organization (WHO, 2009), every minute, at least one woman dies and 20 are affected by the complications related to pregnancy or childbirth. While the root cause of pregnancy complications is unclear, it likely has physical, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects. The Vedas are a rich source of antenatal health care guidelines in all these aspects. The primary objective of the authors was to compile the scriptural and scientific evidence for a holistic antenatal model of yoga with emphasis on sociocultural Indian practices.

25035629	Role of integrated approach of yoga therapy in a failed post-total knee replacement of bilateral knees.	OA Knee is the most common arthritis. Knee replacement Surgeries are being done increasingly in the present times. This has led to the violation of the standard indications and when knees are replaced ignoring other co - musculoskeletal conditions it results in the surgery failing early. This is about a patient who encountered a failed TKR due to improper selection as patient had bilateral OA Hip that was ignored in the initial stages. To overcome the problem she was advised bilateral hip replacement which would leave her with four replacements in the lower limb. She refused surgery and was told there are no alternative treatment options. This patient underwent a 3 week integrated course of IAYT at our center and she made a remarkable recovery. IAYT is a good non-surgical treatment that can be affective both before and after knee replacement and it should be considered as the first choice of treatment before surgery.

25035628	Pulmonary functions in yogic and sedentary population.	BACKGROUND: The Pulmonary Function Tests are important for measuring the fitness of an individual from a physiological point of view. Lung function parameters tend to have a relationship with lifestyle such as regular yoga, an ancient system of Indian Philosophy. Yoga is probably the best lifestyle ever devised in the history of mankind. Hence the present analytical study was undertaken to assess the effects of yoga on respiratory system when compared with sedentary subjects. OBJECTIVE: To compare the pulmonary function test among the yogic and sedentary groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was conducted on 50 subjects practicing yoga and 50 sedentary subjects in the age group of 20-40 years. They were assessed for pulmonary function test in which sedentary group acted as controls. The tests which were recorded as per standard procedure using Medspiror as determinants of pulmonary function were FVC, FEV1, FEV3, PEFR and FVC/FEV1 ratio. RESULTS: Pulmonary Functions were compared between the yoga practitioners and sedentary group. Yoga exercise significantly increased chest wall expansion as observed by higher values of pulmonary functions compared with sedentary controls. The study group were having higher mean of percentage value of FVC 109.1 +/- 18.2%, FEV1 of 116.3 +/- 15.9%, FEV3 of 105.7 +/- 14.9 %, PEFR of 109.2 +/- 21.3% and FEV1/FVC ratio of 111.3 +/- 6.9% as compared to sedentary group. CONCLUSIONS: Regular Yoga practice increases the vital capacity, timed vital capacity, maximum voluntary ventilation, breath holding time and maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures.

25035627	Do side-effects/injuries from yoga practice result in discontinued use? Results of a national survey.	CONTEXT: Yoga-related injuries are of increasing concern as the use of yoga continues to rise. AIMS: The aim of the following study is to examine whether a national sample of yoga practitioners would report discontinued use of yoga due to injury from the practice, assess what injuries resulted in discontinued use, determine what injuries were most common and identify injuries requiring medical attention. METHODS: Secondary data analysis of a nationally representative sample of adults in the United States (n = 23,393). RESULTS: Less than 1% of individuals who had ever practiced yoga (n = 2230) reported an injury from yoga that led to discontinued use. Of those reporting injury, less than one-third (n = 4) reported seeking medical attention. The most common side-effect was back pain. Approximately, half of those reporting back pain sought medical attention. CONCLUSIONS: Injury due to yoga is an infrequent barrier to continued practice and severe injury due to yoga is rare.

25035626	Levels of immune cells in transcendental meditation practitioners.	CONTEXT: Relationships between mind and body have gradually become accepted. Yogic practices cause modulation of the immune system. Transcendental meditation (TM) is a specific form of mantra meditation. We reported previously different plasma levels of catecholamines and pituitary hormones in TM practitioners comparing with a control group, and patterns of the daytime secretion of these hormones different from those normally described. AIMS: The aim of the following study is to evaluate the immune system in these meditation practitioners, by determining leukocytes and lymphocytes subsets. METHODS: TM group consisted of 19 subjects who regularly practice either TM or the more advanced Sidhi-TM technique. A control group consisted of 16 healthy subjects who had not previously used any relaxation technique. Total leukocytes, granulocytes, lymphocytes and monocytes were counted by an automated quantitative hematology analyzer, whereas lymphocytes subsets were determined by flow cytometry. Samples were taken from each subject at 0900 h after an overnight fast. RESULTS: The results indicated that the TM group had higher values than the control group in CD3+CD4-CD8+ lymphocytes (P < 0.05), B lymphocytes (P < 0.01) and natural killer cells (P < 0.01), whereas CD3+CD4+CD8- lymphocytes showed low levels in meditation practitioners (P < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in total leukocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, total lymphocytes or CD3+ lymphocytes comparing both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The technique of meditation studied seems to have a significant effect on immune cells, manifesting in the different circulating levels of lymphocyte subsets analyzed. The significant effect of TM on the neuroendocrine axis and its relationship with the immune system may partly explain our results.

25035625	Self-reported measures of mindfulness in meditators and non-meditators: A cross-sectional study.	CONTEXT: Mindfulness forms an important component of meditation practice and has been increasingly popular around the world. There has been growing interest in studying the mindful component of various meditation techniques. One of the various forms of mindfulness is the practice of a unique technique called cyclic mediation (CM). We aimed at ascertaining the level of mindfulness in experienced practitioners of CM using a Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: MAAS was administered anonymously in a classroom setup and two of the project coordinators were present to supervise the administration and to assist the participants where necessary. We executed a cross sectional design. One hundred and thirty-three (n = 133) healthy male volunteers (66 meditators and 67 non-meditators) with ages ranging from 25 to 35 years participated in the study. Meditators had a minimum 3 years experience of meditation. RESULTS: Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS 20. The data were checked for normality and an independent samples t-test was employed to compare the means of both the groups. MAAS scores were significantly higher in meditators as compared with the non-meditators (P < 0.001). We found a positive correlation (r = 0.620) between the years of meditation practice and the levels of trait mindfulness. CONCLUSIONS: CM can lead to development of higher levels of mindfulness and may have the ability to positively impact mental states and attention, thereby offering the potential for prevention of clinical levels of psychopathology and improving overall psychological well-being in healthy individuals.

25035624	Effect of Bhramari Pranayama on response inhibition: Evidence from the stop signal task.	CONTEXT: Response inhibition is a key executive control processes. An inability to inhibit inappropriate actions has been linked to a large range of neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders. AIMS: Examine the effect of Bhramari Pranayama (Bhpr) on response inhibition in healthy individuals. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Thirty-one male students age ranged from 19-31 years from a residential Yoga University, Bengaluru, India were recruited for this study. We used a randomized self as control within-subjects design. Participants were counterbalanced randomly into two different experimental conditions (Bhpr and deep breathing (DB)). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Response inhibition has been measured using a standard tool Stop Signal Task (SST). Each session lasted for 50 min with 10 min for the experimental conditions, preceded and followed by 20 min of assessment. The primary outcome measure was stop signal reaction time (SSRT), an estimate of the subject's capacity for inhibiting prepotent motor responses. Additional measures of interest were the probability of responding on stop signal trials, P (r | s) and mean RT to go stimuli. RESULTS: The mean probability of responding on stop signal trials (P (r | s)) during Bhpr and DB are close to 50%, indicating reliable SSRT. Paired sample t-tests showed a significant decrease (P = 0.024) in SSRT after Bhpr session, while the DB group did not show any significant change. Further, t-tests show that the go RT increased significantly after Bhpr (P = 0.007) and no other changes/differences were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Bhpr enhanced response inhibition and cognitive control in nonclinical participants.	Rajesh, Sasidharan K;Ilavarasu, Judu V;Srinivasan, Thaiyar M	2014 Jul
25035623	Hatha yoga on body balance.	BACKGROUND: A good body balance requires a proper function of vestibular, visual, and somatosensory systems which can be reach with exercise practice and/or yoga. AIM: To determine the effects of a 5-month hatha yoga training program on body balance in young adults. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used a controlled, nonrandomized design, where the experimental group underwent a 5-month training program and were then compared with the control group that had a sedentary lifestyle. A convenience sample of 34 out of 40 men aged 25-55 years old (34.0 +/- 0.9) were deemed eligible for this study. They were randomly divided into two groups: Experimental and control groups. Subjects in the experimental group were engaged in 60 min sessions of hatha yoga three times a week for 5 months. We evaluated postural control by measuring the limit of stability and velocity of oscillation (VOS) in three conditions of the balance rehabilitation unit (BRU) and through field procedures (four position, plane, flamingo, hopscotch, and dynamic test). RESULTS: We observed differences (P < 0.05) in postintervention scores between the groups regardless of BRU parameters and field procedures (except for flamingo) even after adjusting for preintervention scores, suggesting that these changes were induced by hatha yoga training. The partial eta squared on BRU parameters ranged from 0.78 (VOS1)-0.97 (COP2), and from 0.00 (flamingo)-0.94 (four position) for the field procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide substantial evidence that postural control in healthy young adults can be improved through practicing hatha yoga.

25035622	Effect of Yoga on migraine: A comprehensive study using clinical profile and cardiac autonomic functions.	CONTEXT AND AIMS: Migraine is an episodic disabling headache requiring long-term management. Migraine management through Yoga therapy would reduce the medication cost with positive health benefits. Yoga has shown to improve the quality of life, reduce the episode of headache and medication. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of Yoga as an adjuvant therapy in migraine patients by assessing clinical outcome and autonomic functions tests. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Migraine patients were randomly given either conventional care (n = 30) or Yoga with conventional care (n = 30). Yoga group received Yoga practice session for 5 days a week for 6 weeks along with conventional care. Clinical assessment (frequency, intensity of headache and headache impact) and autonomic function test were done at baseline and at the end of the intervention. RESULTS: Yoga with conventional care and convention care groups showed significant improvement in clinical variables, but it was better with Yoga therapy. Improvement in the vagal tone along with reduced sympathetic activity was observed in patients with migraine receiving Yoga as adjuvant therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Intervention showed significant clinical improvement in both groups. Headache frequency and intensity were reduced more in Yoga with conventional care than the conventional care group alone. Furthermore, Yoga therapy enhanced the vagal tone and decreased the sympathetic drive, hence improving the cardiac autonomic balance. Thus, Yoga therapy can be effectively incorporated as an adjuvant therapy in migraine patients.

25035621	Implicit measure for yoga research: Yoga implicit association test.	CONTEXT: The implicit association test (IAT), a new tool for yoga research is presented. Implicit measures could be used in those situations where (1) The construct is difficult to self-report, (2) there is a threat of social desirability. Clinically, we can assess cognitive dissonance by evaluating incongruence between implicit and explicit measures. Explicit preferences are self-reported. Implicit preferences are what we inherently believe, often without our conscious awareness. AIMS: The primary objective of this study is to provide a bird's eye view of the field, implicit cognition, with emphasis on the IAT and the secondary objective is to illustrate through an example of our study to develop an implicit tool to assess implicit preference toward yoga. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A total of 5 independent samples of total 69 students undergoing short and long-term yoga courses in a Yoga University were assessed for their implicit and explicit preferences towards yoga. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The yoga-IAT (Y-IAT), explicit self-rating scale was administered through computers using the Inquisit program by Millisecond Software. Experimental and scoring materials are provided. RESULTS: A moderate preference toward yoga was detected, with a lower implicit-explicit congruence, reflecting possible confound of social desirability in the self-report of preference toward yoga. CONCLUSIONS: Implicit measures may be used in the yoga field to assess constructs, which are difficult to self-report or may have social desirability threat. Y-IAT may be used to evaluate implicit preference toward yoga.	Ilavarasu, Judu V;Rajesh, Sasidharan K;Hankey, Alex	2014 Jul
25035620	Effect of yogic colon cleansing (Laghu Sankhaprakshalana Kriya) on pain, spinal flexibility, disability and state anxiety in chronic low back pain.	BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that Integrated Yoga reduces pain, disability, anxiety and depression and increases spinal flexibility and quality-of-life in chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the effect of two yoga practices namely laghu shankha prakshalana (LSP) kriya, a yogic colon cleansing technique and back pain specific asanas (Back pain special technique [BST]) on pain, disability, spinal flexibility and state anxiety in patients with CLBP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized control (self as control) study, 40 in-patients (25 were males, 15 were females) between 25 and 70 years (44.05 +/- 13.27) with CLBP were randomly assigned to receive LSP or BST sessions. The measurements were taken immediately before and after each session of either of the practices (30 min) in the same participant. Randomization was used to decide the day of the session (3(rd) or 5(th) day after admission) to ensure random distribution of the hang over effect of the two practices. Statistical analysis was performed using the repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Significant group * time interaction (P < 0.001) was observed in 11 point numerical rating scale, spinal flexibility (on Leighton type Goniometer) and (straight leg raise test in both legs), Oswestry Disability Index, State Anxiety (XI component of Spieldberger's state and trait anxiety inventory. There was significantly (P < 0.001, between groups) better reduction in LSP than BST group on all variables. No adverse effects were reported by any participant. CONCLUSION: Clearing the bowel by yoga based colon cleansing technique (LSP) is safe and offers immediate analgesic effect with reduced disability, anxiety and improved spinal flexibility in patients with CLBP.

25035619	Effect of Bhramari pranayama and OM chanting on pulmonary function in healthy individuals: A prospective randomized control trial.	BACKGROUND/AIM: Yoga is an ancient Indian science as well as the way of life. Pranayama is a part of yoga, which improves pulmonary function in combination of many pranayama, but the aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of only Bhramari pranayama and OM chanting on pulmonary function in healthy individuals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 82 subjects were randomized into the study group (SG) (n = 41) and control group (CG) (n = 41). Baseline assessment was performed before intervention for both groups. SG practiced Bhramari pranayama and OM chanting for the duration of 10 min (5 min for each practice)/day for the period of 6 days/week for 2 weeks and CG did not practice so. After intervention post-assessment was performed for SG (n = 40) and CG (n = 39). Statistical analysis was performed by Independent samples t-test and Student's paired t-test with the use of Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 16 (2007, USA). RESULTS: The result showed a significant improvement in peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced expiratory flow (FEF)25% and maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV) along with a significant reduction in weight in SG compared with CG in independent samples t-test. Significant improvement in slow vital capacity (SVC), forced expired volume in 1 s (FEV1) along with PEF, FEF25% and MVV; Significant reduction in weight and body mass index were observed in SG unlike in CG in Student's paired t-test. No significant changes were found in forced vital capacity, FEV1 /SVC and FEF50% , between and within the group analysis of SG and CG. CONCLUSION: Bhramari pranayama and OM chanting are effective in improving pulmonary function in healthy individuals.	Mooventhan, A;Khode, Vitthal	2014 Jul
25035618	Effect of trataka on cognitive functions in the elderly.	BACKGROUND: Trataka, a type of yoga practice is considered to improve cognitive functions. The aim of this study was to test the effect of trataka on cognitive functions of the elderly. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Elderly subjects were recruited based on inclusion and exclusion criteria (n = 60) and randomly divided using randomized block design into two groups: Trataka and wait list control group. Trataka (a visual cleansing technique) was given for a period of 1 month (26 days). The subjects in both groups were assessed on day 1 (pre- and postintervention in trataka group and after quiet sitting in control group) and on day 30 on Digit Span Test, Six Letter Cancellation Test (SLCT), and Trail Making Test-B (TMT-B). RESULTS: Friedman's test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that at the 2(nd) follow-up there was significant improvement in digit span scores (z = -3.35, P < 0.01) in the trataka group. SLCT scores (t = 5.08, P < 0.01) and TMT-B scores (t = -4.26, P < 0.01) improved immediately after the practice of trataka (when baseline compared to first follow-up). At 1 month follow-up, trataka group showed significantly better performance in the SLCT test compared to baseline (t = -3.93, P < 0.01) and TMT-B scores (t = 7.09, P < 0.01). Repeated measure analysis of variance (RM ANOVA) results also reiterated that there was significant interaction effect at the end of 1 month of trataka intervention as compared to control group on TMT-B and SLCT scores. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study establish that Trataka can be used as a technique to enhance cognition in the elderly.	Talwadkar, Shubhada;Jagannathan, Aarti;Raghuram, Nagarathna	2014 Jul
25035617	Comparative immediate effect of different yoga asanas on heart rate and blood pressure in healthy young volunteers.	INTRODUCTION: This study planned to compare immediate cardiovascular effects of different yoga asanas in healthy young volunteers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Heart rate (HR), systolic pressure (SP), and diastolic pressure (DP), blood pressure (BP), were recorded using the non invasive blood pressure (NIBP) apparatus in 22 healthy young subjects, before and after the performance of Dhanurasana (DA), Vakrasana (VA) (both sides), Janusirasasana (JSA) (both sides), Matsyasana and Shavasana for 30 s. HR and BP were further recorded during supine recovery at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 min. A repeated measure of ANOVA was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: There were significant changes in HR and BP both immediately after the Asanas as well as during the recovery period. Overall comparisons of % changes immediately after the performance of the Asanas revealed significant differences with regard to HR that increased significantly after DA. In the recovery phase, there were significant intergroup differences from 2 min onward in both SP and DP. The decrease of SP after VA (right side) (VA-R) was significantly greater than Shavasana (4(th), 6(th), and 8(th) min) and JSA (left side) (JSA-L) at 6(th) and 8(th) min. DP decreased significantly after performing JSA-L compared to VA-R at the 6(th) and 8(th) min. DISCUSSION: The cardiovascular changes immediately after the Asanas and during the recovery phase reveal inherent differences between the selected postures. The rise of HR in DA may be attributed to increased sympathetic response due to the relative difficulty of the posture as well as abdominal compression occurring in it. The effect of supine relaxation is more pronounced after the performance of the Asanas as compared to mere relaxation in Shavasana. This may be attributed to a normalization and resultant homeostatic effect occurring due to a greater, healthier de-activation of the autonomic nervous system occurring towing to the presence of prior activation. There were also subtle differences between the right sided and left sided performance of VA and JSA that may be occurring due to the different internal structures being either compressed or relaxed on either side. CONCLUSION: Our study provides initial evidence of differential cardiovascular effects of Asanas and subtle differences between right and left sided performance. Further, cardiovascular recovery is greater after the performance of the Asanas as compared to shavasan; thus, implying a better response when effort precedes relaxation.

25035612	Effect of repetitive yogic squats with specific hand position (Thoppukaranam) on selective attention and psychological states.	CONTEXT: Research on the effect of Thoppukaranam is limited despite it being practiced as a form of worship to the elephant-headed deity Lord Ganapati and punishment in schools. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of Thoppukaranam on selective attention and psychological states in a sample of young adults. SETTINGS AND DESIGNS: A randomized self-as-control within subjects design was employed. Thirty undergraduate students (4 females and 26 males) from a residential Yoga University in Southern India were recruited for this study (group mean age +/- standard deviation, 20.17 +/- 2.92). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The d2 test, State Anxiety Inventory-Short Form and State Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (SMAAS) were used to measure cognitive performance and psychological states. Assessments were made in three sessions: Baseline, control (squats), and experimental (Thoppukaranam) on 3 separate days. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Data were analyzed using one-way repeated measures analyses of variance between three sessions, that is, baseline, squat, and Thoppukaranam. RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in all measures of the d2 test of attention (TN, E, TN-E, E%, and concentration performance) and state mindfulness after Thoppukaranam. Further state anxiety reduced significantly after the experimental session. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate Thoppukaranam results in enhancement of cognitive functioning and psychological states.	Chandrasekeran, Angelica;Rajesh, Sasidharan K;Srinivasan, Tm	2014 Jan
25035611	Effect of 11 months of yoga training on cardiorespiratory responses during the actual practice of Surya Namaskar.	BACKGROUND: Surya Namaskar (SN), a popular traditional Indian yogic practice, includes practicing 12 physical postures with alternate forward and backward bending movement of the body along with deep breathing maneuvers. The practice of SN has become popular among yoga practitioners and other fitness conscious people. The long-term effect of practicing SN and other yogic practices on cardiorespiratory responses during SN are lacking. AIM: The present study was conducted to study the effect of yogic training on various cardiorespiratory responses during the SN practice in yoga trainees after a time interval of 3, 6, and 11 months. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study was conducted on 9 healthy male Army soldiers who underwent training in various yoga postures including SN, meditation, and pranayama for 1 h daily for 11 months. First, second, and third phase of the study was conducted in the laboratory after completion of 3, 6, and 11 months of the yoga training. The participants performed SN along with other yogic practices in the laboratory as per their daily practice schedule. The cardiorespiratory responses of the volunteers were recorded during actual practice of SN. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: One-way repeated measure ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD. RESULTS: Oxygen consumption and heart rate during actual practice of SN was 0.794 +/- 0.252, 0.738 +/- 0.229, and 0.560 +/- 0.165 L/min and 92.1 +/- 11.6, 97.9 +/- 7.3 and 87.4 +/- 9.2 beats/min respectively at 1(st) , 2(nd) , and 3(rd) phase of yoga training. Minute ventilation and tidal volume also reduced from 19.9 +/- 4.65 to 17.8 +/- 4.41 L/min and 1.091 +/- 0.021 to 0.952 L/breath from 1(st) phase to 3(rd) phase of yoga training. However, respiratory parameters like breathing rate (fR) did not show any reduction across the three phases. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study indicated that yogic training caused conditioning of cardiorespiratory parameters except fR, which did not reduce across three phases of training.

25035610	Barriers in the path of yoga practice: An online survey.	CONTEXT: Clinical benefits of yoga have been well explored, but factors contributing to adherence to regular yoga practice are not well studied. AIMS: To study the factors influencing adherence to yoga practices on those participants who have completed 1-month Yoga Instructors' course from a yoga university. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Online survey was conducted on participants who had finished 1-month Yoga Instructors' course at a yoga university. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Online survey was conducted using Survey Monkey web portal with response rate of 42.5%. A total of 1355 participants were approached. Demographic items and a checklist of 21 items on a 5-point likert scale were prepared based on traditional yoga texts. A few items to assess modern lifestyle barriers were also included. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: One-sample proportion test with chi square statistics was used for analysis. RESULTS: Irregularity in lifestyle, family commitments, and occupational commitments are perceived as significant strong barriers. Dullness, excessive talking, strictly adhering to rules, laziness, physical and mental overexertion, fickleness and wandering of mind, unsteadiness of mind, procrastination, and oversleeping are considered as significant barriers of moderate nature. CONCLUSIONS: Modern lifestyle is the major challenge for yoga practitioners to adhere to regular practice of yoga. To address this, attention is required in strengthening the lifestyle management and the spiritual dimension of yoga practice as the spiritual component seems to be side-tracked.

25035609	Differential effects of uninostril and alternate nostril pranayamas on cardiovascular parameters and reaction time.	BACKGROUND: Recent studies have reported the differential physiological and psychological effects of yogic uninostril breathing (UNB) and alternate nostril breathing (ANB) techniques. This study aims to determine differential effects of these techniques on reaction time (RT), heart rate (HR), and blood pressure (BP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty yoga-trained subjects came to the lab on six different days and RT, HR, and BP were recorded randomly before and after nine rounds of right UNB (surya nadi [SN]), left UNB (chandra nadi [CN]), right initiated ANB (surya bhedana [SB]), left initiated ANB (chandra bhedana [CB]), nadi shuddhi (NS), and normal breathing (NB). RESULTS: Overall comparison of % changes showed statistically significant differences between groups for all parameters. There was an overall reduction in HR- and BP-based parameters following CB, CN, and NS with concurrent increases following SB and SN. The differential effects of right nostril initiated (SB and SN) and left nostril initiated (CB, CN, and NS) UNB and ANB techniques were clearly evidenced. Changes following NB were insignificant in all respects. The overall comparison of % changes for RT showed statistically significant differences between groups that were significantly lowered following both SB and SN. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence of sympathomimetic effects of right nostril initiated pranayamas with sympatholytic/parasympathomimetic effect following left nostril initiated pranayamas. We suggest that the main effect of UNB and ANB techniques is determined by the nostril used for inspiration rather than that used for expiration. We conclude that right and left yogic UNB and ANB techniques have differential physiological effects that are in tune with the traditional swara yoga concept that air flow through right nostril (SN and pingala swara) is activatory in nature, whereas the flow through left nostril (CN and ida swara) is relaxatory.

25035608	Effect of yoga on the Myofascial Pain Syndrome of neck.	Myofascial Pain Syndrome (MPS) refers to pain attributed to muscle and its surrounding fascia, which is associated with "myofascial trigger points" (MTrPs). MTrPs in the trapezius has been proposed as the main cause of temporal and cervicogenic headache and neck pain. Literature shows that the prevalence of various musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) among physiotherapists is high. Yoga has traditionally been used to treat MSDs in various populations. But there is scarcity of literature which explains the effects of yoga on reducing MPS of the neck in terms of various physical parameters and subjective responses. Therefore, a pilot study was done among eight physiotherapists with minimum six months of experience. A structured yoga protocol was designed and implemented for five days in a week for four weeks. The outcome variables were Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hands (DASH) score, Neck Disability Index (NDI), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Pressure Pain Threshold (PPT) for Trigger Points, Cervical Range of Motion (CROM) - active & passive, grip and pinch strengths. The variables were compared before and after the intervention. Finally, the result revealed that all the variables (DASH: P<0.00, NDI: P<0.00, VAS: P<0.00, PPT: Left: P<0.00, PPT: Right: P<0.00, Grip strength: left: P<0.00, Grip strength: right: P<0.01, Key pinch: left: P<0.01, Key pinch: right: P<0.01, Palmar pinch: left: P<0.01, Palmar pinch: right: P<0.00, Tip pinch: left: P<0.01, Tip pinch: Right: P<0.01) improved significantly after intervention.

25035607	Changes in pain intensity and health related quality of life with Iyengar yoga in nonspecific chronic low back pain: A randomized controlled study.	BACKGROUND: Nonspecific chronic low back (nCLBP) pain is prevalent among adult population and often leads to functional limitations, psychological symptoms, lower quality of life (QOL), and higher healthcare costs. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of Iyengar yoga therapy on pain intensity and health related quality of life (HRQOL) with nCLBP. AIM OF THE STUDY: To compare the effect of Iyengar yoga therapy and conventional exercise therapy on pain intensity and HRQOL in nonspecific chronic low back pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experimental study with random sampling technique. SUBJECTS/INTERVENTION: Sixty subjects who fulfilled the selection criteria were randomly assigned to Iyengar yoga (yoga group, n = 30) and control group (exercise group, n = 30). Participants completed low back pain evaluation form and HRQOL-4 questionnaire before their intervention and again 4 weeks and 6 month later. Yoga group underwent 29 yogic postures training and exercise group had undergone general exercise program for 4 weeks. STATISTICS: Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze group differences over time, while controlling for baseline differences. RESULTS: Patients in both groups experienced significant reduction in pain and improvement in HRQOL. In visual analogue scale (VAS) yoga group showed reduction of 72.81% (P = 0.001) as compared to exercise group 42.50% (P = 0.001). In HRQOL, yoga group showed reduction of 86.99% (P = 0.001) as compared to exercise group 67.66% (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that Iyengar yoga provides better improvement in pain reduction and improvement in HRQOL in nonspecific chronic back pain than general exercise.

25035606	Effect of yoga training and detraining on respiratory muscle strength in pre-pubertal children: A randomized trial.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of yoga on forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in I(st) second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), FEVI/FVC ratio, and pulmonary pressures [maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) at the end of 3 months yoga training and the detraining effect on the above parameters in 7-9-years-old school going children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 100 participants were recruited from a school in Bangalore. After baseline assessments, the participants were randomly allocated to either yoga or physical activity group. Intervention was given for 3 months, and measures of pulmonary function and pulmonary pressures were determined immediately post-intervention and at 3-months follow-up. RESULTS: Although significant increase was observed in FVC, FEV1, PEFR, FEV1/FVC, MIP, and MEP at post-intervention, there were no significant differences between the two study groups after adjusting for height and age post training . However, MIP increased significantly in both the groups post-intervention, but the yoga group performed significantly higher than the PE group. The effects of training did not fade off even after 3 months of detraining. In fact, the FVC and FEV1 continued to increase significantly. A trend of decrease was observed in PEFR, MIP, and MEP. However, the values did not regress to the baseline value. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that practice of yoga for a short duration (3 months) of time can significantly improve respiratory muscle strength in pediatric population.

25035605	Can yoga practices benefit health by improving organism regulation? Evidence from electrodermal measures of acupuncture meridians.	OBJECTIVES: To document and explain Yoga's effects on acupuncture meridian energies. To understand mechanisms behind Yoga's efficacy by testing links between yoga and traditional Chinese medicine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY COMPARED TWO GROUPS OF YOGA PRACTITIONERS: Novice and experienced. Novices consisted of 33 volunteers from a Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana (S-VYASA) yoga instructor training module and the experienced practitioners were 20 resident SVYASA students. The intervention was 3 weeks of a yoga training program, new for the novices, but the lifestyle of the experienced group, who were therefore assessed only once. Novices were assessed on day 2 and 23 of their program at SVYASA's Yoga Medicine Hospital, making their data a pre-post, self-as-control, prospective study. Main outcome measures were mean acumeridian energy levels assessed by AcuGraph3 measures of electrodermal resistance at acupoints; additionally, gender differences, standard deviations (SDs) of all measures, and comparison of post and experienced group data. RESULTS: Averaged energy levels significantly improved in all 24 meridians (maximum P = 0.032, 4-P < 0.01, and 19-P < 0.001). Females improved more than males (P < 0.05), both ending at similar levels to experienced practitioners, whose SDs were lower than novices on 19/24 meridians (mean F = 3.715, P = 0.0022), and 4/5 average variables. CONCLUSIONS: AcuGraph3 electrodermal measures contain substantial information, P << 0.00001. Yoga-lifestyle practice can increase and balance acumeridian energies; long-term practice decreases group SD's. These three suggest reasons why yoga practice impacts health: One, increased prana levels are important; two and three, improved physiological regulation is the key. Further studies relating traditional Indian and Chinese medical systems are needed.

25035604	Decoding the integrated approach to yoga therapy: Qualitative evidence based conceptual framework.	AIM: The aim of this study was to define, decode, and append to the conceptual frame-work of the integrated approach to yoga therapy (IAYT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four stakeholders who followed two in-patients with depression over a period of 2 weeks in the residential center Arogyadhama (of Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandana Samsthana, Bangalore, India) were interviewed before the start of the IAYT treatment and prior to discharge of the patient. The patients were also interviewed pre and post and were observed once during their session. The data from the audio recordings from eight in-depth interviews were transcribed manually and qualitative analysis was conducted. RESULTS: The conceptual frame-work of IAYT depicts that patient related factors ("co-operation of patient", "patients awareness of his/her condition"), therapist related factors ("ability to guide", "the assistance to the patients", "explanation of the exercises") and treatment related factors ("combination of psychiatric or Ayurvedic medication with yoga", "counseling during the IAYT treatment", duration of treatment), play an integrated role in reaching the "aim of IAYT" and experiencing "improvements and changes". CONCLUSION: The IAYT is a holistic program and the ability of the patient to cooperate with and integrate the available factors (therapist related and treatment related) could enable best results.

25035603	Impact of yoga on biochemical profile of asthmatics: A randomized controlled study.	BACKGROUND: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways. The chronic inflammation causes an associated increase in airway hyperresponsiveness that leads to recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing at night or in the early morning. Most of the studies have reported, as the effects of yoga on bronchial asthma, significant improvements in pulmonary functions, quality of life, and decrease in medication use, but none of the studies has attempted to show the effect of yoga on biochemical changes. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of yoga on biochemical profile of asthmatics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, 276 patients of mild to moderate asthma (FEV 1> 60%) aged between 12 to 60 years were recruited from the Department of Pulmonary Medicine, King George's Medical University, U.P., Lucknow, India. They were randomly divided into two groups: Yoga group (with standard medical treatment and yogic intervention) and control group as standard medical treatment (without yogic intervention). At completion of 6 months of the study period, 35 subjects were dropped out, so out of 276 subjects, only 241 subjects completed the whole study (121 subjects from yoga group and 120 subjects from control group). Biochemical assessment was carried out at baseline and after 6 months of the study period. RESULTS: In yoga group, there was significant improvement found in the proportion of hemoglobin and antioxidant superoxide dismutase in comparison to control group and significant decrease was found in total leukocyte count (TLC) and differential leukocytes count in comparison to control group. There was no significant change found in TLC, polymorphs, and monocytes in between group comparison. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga group got significantly better improvement in biochemical variables than control group.

25035602	Referral to yoga therapists in rural primary health care: A survey of general practitioners in rural and regional New South Wales, Australia.	BACKGROUND: Yoga is an increasingly accepted complementary treatment modality for referral in Australian general practice, yet this practitioner group has largely escaped research attention in Australia. Complementary medicine use is highest in rural and regional areas, where a number of primary health care challenges are also more pronounced. Despite the significant role of complementary therapists in rural and regional Australia, and the increasing acceptance of yoga therapy in general practice, there has been little exploration of the interface between yoga therapists and conventional primary health care practitioners in this area. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 27-item questionnaire was sent to all 1486 general practitioners (GPs) currently practising in rural and regional Divisions of General Practice in New South Wales, Australia. RESULTS: Completed questionnaires were returned by 585 GPs, with 49 returned as 'no longer at this address' (response rate 40.7%). One-in-eight GPs (12.1%) advised their patients of specific yoga therapies and protocols, and 7.2% advised specific meditation techniques. Three-quarters of GPs (76.6%) referred to a yoga therapist at least a few times per year, with 12.5% of GPs referring at least once per week. GPs being in a remote location (OR = 10.95; CI: 1.55, 77.31), being female (OR = 1.85; 95% CI: 1.16, 2.94), GPs graduating from an Australian medical school (OR = 4.52; 95% CI: 2.61, 7.80), perceiving lack of other treatment options (OR = 3.29; 95% CI: 1.61, 6.74), GPs reporting good or very good knowledge of yoga therapies (OR = 18.2; 95% CI: 9.19, 36.19), and GPs using CAM for their own personal health (OR = 4.53; 95% CI: 2.60, 7.87) were all independently predictive of increased referral to yoga therapists amongst the rural GPs in this study. CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant interface between yoga therapists in Australian rural and regional general practice. There is generally high support for yoga therapies among Australian GPs, with low levels of opposition to the incorporation of these therapies in patient care. There is a need for increased research into yoga therapies practice, policy and regulation in these areas.	Wardle, Jon;Adams, Jon;Sibbritt, David	2014 Jan
25035601	In search of yoga: Research trends in a western medical database.	CONTEXT: The promotion of yoga practice as a preventative and treatment therapy for health outcomes in the western hemisphere is increasing rapidly. As the commercial success of yoga burgeons in popular culture, it is important to investigate the trends of yoga as a therapeutic intervention in academic literature. The free-access search engine, PubMed is a preeminent resource to identify health-related research articles published for academics, health practitioners and others. AIMS: To report the recent yoga-related publications in the western healthcare context with particular interest in the subject and type of yoga titles. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A bibliometric analysis to describe the annual trends in publication on PubMed from January 1950 to December 2012. RESULTS: The number of yoga-related titles included in the PubMed database is limited until a marked increase 2000 and steady surge since 2007. Bibliometric analysis indicates that more than 200 new titles are added per annum since 2011. Systematic reviews and yoga trials are increasing exponentially, indicating a potential increase in the quality of evidence. Titles including pain management, stress or anxiety, depression and cancer conditions are highly correlated with yoga and healthcare research. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of yoga research in western healthcare is increasing. The marked increase in volume indicates the need for more systematic analysis of the literature in terms of quality and results.	McCall, Marcy C	2014 Jan

25032903	Interpersonal stressors predict ghrelin and leptin levels in women.	OBJECTIVE: Stressful events enhance risk for weight gain and adiposity. Ghrelin and leptin, two hormones that are implicated in appetite regulation, may link stressful events to weight gain; a number of rodent studies suggest that stressors increase ghrelin production. The present study investigated the links among daily stressors, ghrelin and leptin, and dietary intake in humans. METHOD: Women (n=50) completed three study appointments that were scheduled at least 2 weeks apart. At each visit, women arrived fasting and ate a standardized breakfast and lunch. Blood samples were collected 45min after each meal. Women completed a self-report version of the Daily Inventory of Stressful Events (DISE) at each appointment. Two composites were created from the DISE data, reflecting the number of stressors that did and did not involve interpersonal tension. RESULTS: Women who experienced more stressors involving interpersonal tension had higher ghrelin and lower leptin levels than those who experienced fewer interpersonal stressors. Furthermore, women who experienced more interpersonal stressors had a diet that was higher in calories, fat, carbohydrates, protein, sugar, sodium, and fiber, and marginally higher in cholesterol, vegetables (but not fruits), vitamin A, and vitamin C. Stressors that did not involve interpersonal tension were unrelated to ghrelin and leptin levels or any of the dietary components examined. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that ghrelin and leptin may link daily interpersonal stressors to weight gain and obesity.

25030795	Why practice yoga? Practitioners' motivations for adopting and maintaining yoga practice.	We examined motives for adopting and maintaining yoga practice in a national survey of yoga practitioners (360 yoga students, 156 yoga teachers). Both students and teachers adopted yoga practice primarily for exercise and stress relief, but reported many other reasons, including flexibility, getting into shape, and depression/anxiety relief. Over 62 percent of students and 85 percent of teachers reported having changed their primary reason for practicing or discovering other reasons; for both, the top changed primary reason was spirituality. Findings suggest that most initiate yoga practice for exercise and stress relief, but for many, spirituality becomes their primary reason for maintaining practice.

25025601	Iyengar yoga for adolescents and young adults with irritable bowel syndrome.	OBJECTIVES: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic, disabling condition that greatly compromises patient functioning. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a 6-week twice per week Iyengar yoga (IY) program on IBS symptoms in adolescents and young adults (YA) with IBS compared with a usual-care waitlist control group. METHODS: Assessments of symptoms, global improvement, pain, health-related quality of life, psychological distress, functional disability, fatigue, and sleep were collected pre- and posttreatment. Weekly ratings of pain, IBS symptoms, and global improvement were also recorded until 2-month follow-up. A total of 51 participants completed the intervention (yoga = 29; usual-care waitlist = 22). RESULTS: Baseline attrition was 24%. On average, the yoga group attended 75% of classes. Analyses were divided by age group. Relative to controls, adolescents (14-17 years) assigned to yoga reported significantly improved physical functioning, whereas YA (18-26 years) assigned to yoga reported significantly improved IBS symptoms, global improvement, disability, psychological distress, sleep quality, and fatigue. Although abdominal pain intensity was statistically unchanged, 44% of adolescents and 46% of YA reported a minimally clinically significant reduction in pain following yoga, and one-third of YA reported clinically significant levels of global symptom improvement. Analysis of the uncontrolled effects and maintenance of treatment effects for adolescents revealed global improvement immediately post-yoga that was not maintained at follow-up. For YA, global improvement, worst pain, constipation, and nausea were significantly improved postyoga, but only global improvement, worst pain, and nausea maintained at the 2-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that a brief IY intervention is a feasible and safe adjunctive treatment for young people with IBS, leading to benefits in a number of IBS-specific and general functioning domains for YA. The age-specific results suggest that yoga interventions may be most fruitful when developmentally tailored.

25024234	The effects of an 8-week Hatha yoga intervention on executive function in older adults.	BACKGROUND: Few scientific studies have examined movement-based embodied contemplative practices such as yoga and their effects on cognition. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to examine the effects of an 8-week Hatha yoga intervention on executive function measures of task switching and working memory capacity. METHODS: Community-dwelling older adults (N = 118; mean age = 62.0) were randomized to one of two groups: a Hatha yoga intervention or a stretching-strengthening control. Both groups participated in hour-long exercise classes 3x/week over the 8-week study period. All participants completed established tests of executive function including the task switching paradigm, n-back and running memory span at baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: Analysis of covariances showed significantly shorter reaction times on the mixed and repeat task switching trials (partial eta(2) = .04, p < .05) for the Hatha yoga group. Higher accuracy was recorded on the single trials (partial eta(2) = .05, p < .05), the 2-back condition of the n-back (partial eta(2) = .08, p < .001), and partial recall scores (partial eta(2) = .06, p < .01) of running span task. CONCLUSIONS: Following 8 weeks of yoga practice, participants in the yoga intervention group showed significantly improved performance on the executive function measures of working memory capacity and efficiency of mental set shifting and flexibility compared with their stretching-strengthening counterparts. Although the underlying mechanisms need to be investigated, these results demand larger systematic trials to thoroughly examine effects of yoga on executive function as well as across other domains of cognition, and its potential to maintain or improve cognitive functioning in the aging process.

25022459	Preventing Loss of Independence through Exercise (PLIE): qualitative analysis of a clinical trial in older adults with dementia.	OBJECTIVES: Preventing Loss of Independence through Exercise (PLIE) is a novel, integrative exercise program for individuals with dementia that combines elements of different conventional and complementary exercise modalities (e.g. tai-chi, yoga, Feldenkrais, and dance movement therapy) and focuses on training procedural memory for basic functional movements (e.g., sit-to-stand) while increasing mindful body awareness and facilitating social connection. This study presents analyses of qualitative data collected during a 36-week cross-over pilot clinical trial in 11 individuals. METHODS: Qualitative data included exercise instructors' written notes, which were prepared after each class and also following biweekly telephone calls with caregivers and monthly home visits; three video-recorded classes; and written summaries prepared by research assistants following pre- and post-intervention quantitative assessments. Data were extracted for each study participant and placed onto a timeline for month of observation. Data were coded and analyzed to identify themes that were confirmed and refined through an iterative, collaborative process by the entire team including a qualitative researcher (SA) and the exercise instructors. RESULTS: Three overarching themes emerged: (1) Functional changes included increasing body awareness, movement memory and functional skill. (2) Emotional changes included greater acceptance of resting, sharing of personal stories and feelings, and positive attitude toward exercise. (3) Social changes included more coherent social interactions and making friends. CONCLUSIONS: These qualitative results suggest that the PLIE program may be associated with beneficial functional, emotional, and social changes for individuals with mild to moderate dementia. Further study of the PLIE program in individuals with dementia is warranted.	Wu, Eveline;Barnes, Deborah E;Ackerman, Sara L;Lee, Jennifer;Chesney, Margaret;Mehling, Wolf E	2015
25015704	Cognitive and brain reserve for mind-body therapeutic approaches in multiple sclerosis: a review.	PURPOSE: Cognitive impairment is one of the most disabling symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS), affecting a large proportion of patients and having a severe impact on their quality of life. Nevertheless, there exists a large variability in the neuropsychological profiles of MS patients and some of them appear to withstand better than others the MS-related brain pathology before showing cognitive decline. In recent years, many studies have made use of concepts such as cognitive reserve and brain reserve to take account of the inter-individual discrepancy between cognitive impairment and MS pathology. Critically, these studies have left open the fundamental issue of the clinical implications of this research for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in MS. METHODS AND RESULTS: We provide an updated and extensive overview of the studies that have explored cognitive and brain reserve in MS and discuss their implications for non-pharmacological therapeutic strategies aimed at potentiating patients' reserve. In particular, the possible utility of integrated approaches based on mind-body techniques such as mindfulness-meditation is considered. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that these techniques represent challenging mental enriching activities that may help cultivating cognitive reserve and more systematic research on their efficacy to protect against cognitive degradation in MS is encouraged.

25013838	Yoga therapy for promoting emotional sensitivity in University students.	BACKGROUND: Students need emotional intelligence (EI) for their better academic excellence. There are three important psychological dimensions of EI: Emotional sensitivity (ES), emotional maturity (EM) and emotional competency (EC), which motivate students to recognize truthfully, interpret honestly and handle tactfully the dynamics of their behavioral pattern. OBJECTIVE: The study was designed to assess ES in the students undergoing yoga therapy program in the form of yoga instructor's course (YIC) module. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and eighty four YIC students with 25.77 +/- 4.85 years of mean age participated in this study of 21 days duration (a single group pre-post design). The ES data was collected before (pre) and after (post) YIC module using Emotional Quotient test developed by Dr Dalip Singh and Dr N K Chadha. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Means, standard deviations, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and Wilcoxon signed rank test were used for analyzing the data with the help of SPSS 16. RESULTS: The data analysis showed 3.63% significant increase (P < 0.01) in ES. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that YIC module can result in improvement of ES among university students, thus paving the way for their academic success. Additional well-designed studies are needed before a strong recommendation can be made.	Ganpat, Tikhe Sham;Dash, Sasmita;Ramarao, Nagendra Hongasandra	2014
25012275	Age-related changes in cardiovascular system, autonomic functions, and levels of BDNF of healthy active males: role of yogic practice.	Aging is associated with decline in cardiovascular, autonomic function, and brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF). Reports are scanty regarding whether yoga can improve age-related degenerative changes in healthy active men. This study is designed to appraise the role of yoga in improving age-related degenerative changes in cardiometabolic risk profile, autonomic function, stress, and BDNF. Healthy active males of three age groups (20-29, 30-39, and 40-49 years) were randomly assigned to practice yoga daily 1 h for 3 months. Significantly higher values of heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), load in heart (DoP), myocardial oxygen consumption (RPP), and total cholesterol (TC) were noted in senior age group. HR, BP, DoP, RPP, and TC decreased significantly following yogic practice. High frequency (HF), total power (TP), all time domain variables of heart rate variability (HRV), and skin conductance (SC) were significantly decreased with advancement of age. HF, TP, and time domain parameters of HRV and SC increased significantly following yogic practice. Higher levels of catecholamines and low frequency (LF) power of HRV was noted with advancement of age. Levels of catecholamines and LF significantly decreased following yogic practice. Cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level raised in senior age group. BDNF, serotonin, and dopamine were low in higher age group. Significant decrement of cortisol; ACTH; and increment in serotonin, dopamine, and BDNF was noted following yogic practice. This study revealed that yogic practices might help in the prevention of age-related degeneration by changing cardiometabolic risk factors, autonomic function, and BDNF in healthy male.

25010441	Amplified pain syndromes in children: treatment and new insights into disease pathogenesis.	PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Although many diagnostic terms are used for pediatric chronic pain, evidence suggests a common thread of signal amplification, leading to the unifying term 'amplified pain syndromes'. Ongoing research provides new insights into biopsychosocial contributors and treatments for pediatric amplified pain syndromes. RECENT FINDINGS: Basic science indicates a complex interplay of genetic, epigenetic, neurochemical, endocrine, and inflammatory contributors, along with environmental and psychological factors. Although medications and interventions remain common approaches to children with chronic pain, their evidence is limited. Preliminary evidence exists for mindfulness-based therapies, yoga, and other complementary/alternative medicine approaches. The strongest evidence is for exercise-based and cognitive-behavioral treatments, in particular, when combined in a multidisciplinary format. Intensive approaches (pain rehabilitation) have the potential to effectively and efficiently treat those most disabled by amplified pain syndromes, and lead to sustained improvement in pain, functioning, and medical utilization. SUMMARY: Although understanding of the mechanisms underlying pediatric amplified pain syndromes evolves, standard of care is multidisciplinary emphasizing exercise therapy, cognitive-behavioral treatment, and self-regulation. Treatment should target full return to physical function, which leads to subsequent improvement or resolution of pain. Multidisciplinary care can be coordinated by a rheumatologist or other physician with appropriate referrals, or through a multidisciplinary team.	Hoffart, Cara M;Wallace, Dustin P	2014 Sep
25004196	Yoga as an adjunctive treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder: a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: More than a third of the approximately 10 million women with histories of interpersonal violence in the United States develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Currently available treatments for this population have a high rate of incomplete response, in part because problems in affect and impulse regulation are major obstacles to resolving PTSD. This study explored the efficacy of yoga to increase affect tolerance and to decrease PTSD symptomatology. METHOD: Sixty-four women with chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD were randomly assigned to either trauma-informed yoga or supportive women's health education, each as a weekly 1-hour class for 10 weeks. Assessments were conducted at pretreatment, midtreatment, and posttreatment and included measures of DSM-IV PTSD, affect regulation, and depression. The study ran from 2008 through 2011. RESULTS: The primary outcome measure was the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). At the end of the study, 16 of 31 participants (52%) in the yoga group no longer met criteria for PTSD compared to 6 of 29 (21%) in the control group (n = 60, chi(2)(1) = 6.17, P = .013). Both groups exhibited significant decreases on the CAPS, with the decrease falling in the large effect size range for the yoga group (d = 1.07) and the medium to large effect size decrease for the control group (d = 0.66). Both the yoga (b = -9.21, t = -2.34, P = .02, d = -0.37) and control (b = -22.12, t = -3.39, P = .001, d = -0.54) groups exhibited significant decreases from pretreatment to the midtreatment assessment. However, a significant group x quadratic trend interaction (d = -0.34) showed that the pattern of change in Davidson Trauma Scale significantly differed across groups. The yoga group exhibited a significant medium effect size linear (d = -0.52) trend. In contrast, the control group exhibited only a significant medium effect size quadratic trend (d = 0.46) but did not exhibit a significant linear trend (d = -0.29). Thus, both groups exhibited significant decreases in PTSD symptoms during the first half of treatment, but these improvements were maintained in the yoga group, while the control group relapsed after its initial improvement. DISCUSSION: Yoga significantly reduced PTSD symptomatology, with effect sizes comparable to well-researched psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacologic approaches. Yoga may improve the functioning of traumatized individuals by helping them to tolerate physical and sensory experiences associated with fear and helplessness and to increase emotional awareness and affect tolerance.

24998402	Metabolic, cardiopulmonary, and gait profiles of recently injured and noninjured runners.	OBJECTIVE: To examine whether runners recovering from a lower body musculoskeletal injury have different metabolic, cardiopulmonary, and gait responses compared with healthy runners. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Research laboratory at an academic institution. METHODS: Healthy runners (n = 50) were compared with runners who were recently injured but had returned to running (n = 50). Both groups were participating in similar cross-training modalities such as swimming, weight training, biking, and yoga. Running gait was analyzed on a treadmill using 3-dimensional motion capture, and metabolic and cardiopulmonary measures were captured simultaneously with a portable metabolic analyzer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of oxygen consumption, heart rate, ventilation, carbohydrate and fat oxidation values, gait temporospatial parameters and range of motion measures (ROM) in the sagittal plane, energy expenditure, and vertical displacement of the body's center of gravity (COG). RESULTS: The self-selected running speed was different between the injured and healthy runners (9.7 +/- 1.1 km/h and 10.6 +/- 1.1 km/h, respectively; P = .038). No significant group differences were noted in any metabolic or cardiopulmonary variable while running at the self-selected or standard speed (13.6 km/h). The vertical displacement of the COG was less in the injured group (8.4 +/- 1.4 cm and 8.9 +/- 1.4, respectively; P = .044). ROM about the right ankle in the sagittal plane at the self-selected running speed during the gait cycle was less in the injured runners compared with the healthy runners (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Runners with a recent lower body injury who have returned to running have similar cardiopulmonary and metabolic responses to running as healthy runners at the self-selected and standard speeds; this finding may be due in part to participation in cross-training modes that preserve cardiopulmonary and metabolic adaptations. Injured runners may conserve motion by minimizing COG displacement and ankle joint ROM during a gait cycle.

24996759	A systematic scoping review of yoga intervention components and study quality.	CONTEXT: The scientific study of yoga requires rigorous methodology. This review aimed to systematically assess all studies of yoga interventions to (1) determine yoga intervention characteristics; (2) examine methodologic quality of the subset of RCTs; and (3) explore how well these interventions are reported. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Searches were conducted through April 2012 in PubMed, PsycINFO, Ageline, and Ovid's Alternative and Complementary Medicine database using the text term yoga, and through handsearching five journals. Original studies were included if the intervention (1) consisted of at least one yoga session with some type of health assessment; (2) targeted adults aged >/=18 years; (3) was published in an English-language peer-reviewed journal; and (4) was available for review. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Of 3,062 studies identified, 465 studies in 30 countries were included. Analyses were conducted through 2013. Most interventions took place in India (n=228) or the U.S. (n=124), with intensity ranging from a single yoga session up to two sessions per day. Intervention lengths ranged from one session to 2 years. Asanas (poses) were mentioned as yoga components in 369 (79%) interventions, but were either minimally or not at all described in 200 (54%) of these. Most interventions (74%, n=336) did not include home practice. Of the included studies, 151 were RCTs. RCT quality was rated as poor. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the inadequate reporting and methodologic limitations of current yoga intervention research, which limits study interpretation and comparability. Recommendations for future methodology and reporting are discussed.	Elwy, A Rani;Groessl, Erik J;Eisen, Susan V;Riley, Kristen E;Maiya, Meghan;Lee, Jennifer P;Sarkin, Andrew;Park, Crystal L	2014 Aug
24995168	Effect of slow and fast pranayama training on handgrip strength and endurance in healthy volunteers.	BACKGROUND: Pranayama has been assigned very important role in yogic system of exercises and is said to be much more important than yogasanas for keeping sound health. Also different pranayamas produce divergent physiological effects. AIM: To study the effect of 12 weeks training of slow and fast pranayama on handgrip strength and endurance in young, healthy volunteers of JIPMER population. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Present study was conducted in the Department of Physiology, JIPMER in 2011-12 (1.06.11 to 1.04.12). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total of 91 volunteer subjects were randomised into slow pranayama (SPG) (n=29), fast pranayama (FPG) (n=32) and control groups (CG) (n=30). Supervised pranayama training (SPG - Nadisodhana, Pranav pranayama and Savitri pranayama; FPG - Kapalabhati, Bhastrika and Kukkuriya pranayama) was given for 30 minutes thrice a week for 12 weeks to both slow and fast pranayama groups by certified yoga trainer. Hand grip strength (HGS) and endurance (HGE) parameters were recorded using handgrip dynamometer (Rolex, India) at baseline and after 12 weeks of pranayama training. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Longitudinal changes in each group were compared by using Student's paired t-test. Delta changes in each group were analysed by ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc analysis. RESULTS: In SPG significant improvement occurred only in HGE parameter from 83.95+/-45.06 to 101.62+/-53.87 (seconds) (p<0.001) whereas in FPG, significant improvement was observed in HGS from 33.31+/-9.83 to 37.9+/-9.41 (Kilograms) (p=0.01) as well as in HGE from 92.78+/-41.37 to 116.56+/-58.54 (seconds) (p=0.004). Using Students unpaired t-test difference between the groups in HGS is found to be 1.17+/-5.485 in SPG and in FPG is 4.59+/-7.26 (p=0.39); HGE difference in SPG is 1.77+/-21.17 and in FPG is 2.38+/-43.27 (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Pranayama training decreases sympathetic activity, resulting in mental relaxation and decreased autonomic arousal thereby, decreasing force fluctuations during isometric contraction. This is reflected as improvement in HGS and HGE.	Thangavel, Dinesh;Gaur, Girwar Singh;Sharma, Vivek Kumar;Bhavanani, Ananda Balayogi;Rajajeyakumar, M;Syam, Sunder A	2014 May
24988414	The effects of mind-body therapies on the immune system: meta-analysis.	IMPORTANCE: Psychological and health-restorative benefits of mind-body therapies have been investigated, but their impact on the immune system remain less defined. OBJECTIVE: To conduct the first comprehensive review of available controlled trial evidence to evaluate the effects of mind-body therapies on the immune system, focusing on markers of inflammation and anti-viral related immune responses. METHODS: Data sources included MEDLINE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, and PsycINFO through September 1, 2013. Randomized controlled trials published in English evaluating at least four weeks of Tai Chi, Qi Gong, meditation, or Yoga that reported immune outcome measures were selected. Studies were synthesized separately by inflammatory (n = 18), anti-viral related immunity (n = 7), and enumerative (n = 14) outcomes measures. We performed random-effects meta-analyses using standardized mean difference when appropriate. RESULTS: Thirty-four studies published in 39 articles (total 2, 219 participants) met inclusion criteria. For inflammatory measures, after 7 to 16 weeks of mind-body intervention, there was a moderate effect on reduction of C-reactive protein (effect size [ES], 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.04 to 1.12), a small but not statistically significant reduction of interleukin-6 (ES, 0.35; 95% CI, -0.04 to 0.75), and negligible effect on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (ES, 0.21; 95% CI, -0.15 to 0.58). For anti-viral related immune and enumerative measures, there were negligible effects on CD4 counts (ES, 0.15; 95% CI, -0.04 to 0.34) and natural killer cell counts (ES, 0.12, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.45). Some evidence indicated mind-body therapies increase immune responses to vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Mind-body therapies reduce markers of inflammation and influence virus-specific immune responses to vaccination despite minimal evidence suggesting effects on resting anti-viral or enumerative measures. These immunomodulatory effects, albeit incomplete, warrant further methodologically rigorous studies to determine the clinical implications of these findings for inflammatory and infectious disease outcomes.

24985394	Yogic breathing and Ayurveda in aphasia: a case study.	PURPOSE: We present a case study of a woman who used yogic breathing as Ayurvedic medicine in her recovery from poststroke aphasia. Ayurvedic medicine is one of the most ancient medicines of the world, but it is not widely used for aphasia rehabilitation in many Western countries. The description of this case aims to further the understanding of the benefits that this type of medicine may provide to poststroke patients living with aphasia. METHOD: After her stroke, the patient received brief conventional language therapy for her aphasia. At 5 weeks post stroke, she received no further conventional rehabilitation; instead, she consulted with a Vedic priest. She followed a regimen of different body manipulations, yogic breathing techniques, and ingestion of coconut oil. Cognitive and language testing was performed throughout a 3-month period while she was involved in this therapy. RESULTS: Overall, improvement was noted in language, visual attention, and some mood measures. CONCLUSION: Although case studies lead to limited conclusions, changes were observed for this individual using Ayurvedic medicine. Given the changes in language and some aspects of cognition seen in this patient, further exploration of the effectiveness of yogic breathing and Ayurvedic medicine in the treatment of poststroke aphasia is warranted.

24985393	Randomized controlled trial of yoga for chronic poststroke hemiparesis: motor function, mental health, and quality of life outcomes.	PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy of yoga for motor function, mental health, and quality of life outcomes in persons with chronic poststroke hemiparesis. METHOD: Twenty-two individuals participated in a randomized controlled trial involving assessment of task-orientated function, balance, mobility, depression, anxiety, and quality of life domains before and after either a 10-week yoga intervention (n = 11) or no treatment (n = 11). RESULTS: The yoga intervention did not result in any significant improvements in objective motor function measures, however there was a significant improvement in quality of life associated with perceived motor function (P = .0001) and improvements in perceived recovery approached significance (P = .072). Memory-related quality of life scores significantly improved after yoga intervention (P = .022), and those participating in the intervention exhibited clinically relevant decreases in state and trait anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results offer promise for yoga as an intervention to address mental health and quality of life in persons with stroke-related activity limitations. There is a need to more rigorously evaluate these yoga benefits with a larger randomized controlled trial, which, based on this preliminary trial, is feasible.

24980836	Yoga management of breast cancer-related lymphoedema: a randomised controlled pilot-trial.	BACKGROUND: Secondary arm lymphoedema continues to affect at least 20% of women after treatment for breast cancer requiring lifelong professional treatment and self-management. The holistic practice of yoga may offer benefits as an adjunct self-management option. The aim of this small pilot trial was to gain preliminary data to determine the effect of yoga on women with stage one breast cancer-related lymphoedema (BCRL). This paper reports the results for the primary and secondary outcomes. METHODS: Participants were randomised, after baseline testing, to receive either an 8-week yoga intervention (n = 15), consisting of a weekly 90-minute teacher-led class and a 40-minute daily session delivered by DVD, or to a usual care wait-listed control group (n = 13). Primary outcome measures were: arm volume of lymphoedema measured by circumference and extra-cellular fluid measured by bioimpedance spectroscopy. Secondary outcome measures were: tissue induration measured by tonometry; levels of sensations, pain, fatigue, and their limiting effects all measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS) and quality of life based on the Lymphoedema Quality of Life Tool (LYMQOL). Measurements were conducted at baseline, week 8 (post-intervention) and week 12 (four weeks after cessation of the intervention). RESULTS: At week 8, the intervention group had a greater decrease in tissue induration of the affected upper arm compared to the control group (p = 0.050), as well as a greater reduction in the symptom sub-scale for QOL (p = 0.038). There was no difference in arm volume of lymphoedema or extra-cellular fluid between groups at week 8; however, at week 12, arm volume increased more for the intervention group than the control group (p = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: An 8-week yoga intervention reduced tissue induration of the affected upper arm and decreased the QOL sub-scale of symptoms. Arm volume of lymphoedema and extra-cellular fluid did not increase. These benefits did not last on cessation of the intervention when arm volume of lymphoedema increased. Further research trials with a longer duration, higher levels of lymphoedema and larger numbers are warranted before definitive conclusions can be made.

24980650	A yoga intervention for type 2 diabetes risk reduction: a pilot randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is a major health problem in many countries including India. Yoga may be an effective type 2 diabetes prevention strategy in India, particularly given its cultural familiarity. METHODS: This was a parallel, randomized controlled pilot study to collect feasibility and preliminary efficacy data on yoga for diabetes risk factors among people at high risk of diabetes. Primary outcomes included: changes in BMI, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, insulin, insulin resistance, blood pressure, and cholesterol. We also looked at measures of psychological well-being including changes in depression, anxiety, positive and negative affect and perceived stress. Forty-one participants with elevated fasting blood glucose in Bangalore, India were randomized to either yoga (n = 21) or a walking control (n = 20). Participants were asked to either attend yoga classes or complete monitored walking 3-6 days per week for eight weeks. Randomization and allocation was performed using computer-generated random numbers and group assignments delivered in sealed, opaque envelopes generated by off-site study staff. Data were analyzed based on intention to treat. RESULTS: This study was feasible in terms of recruitment, retention and adherence. In addition, yoga participants had significantly greater reductions in weight, waist circumference and BMI versus control (weight -0.8 +/- 2.1 vs. 1.4 +/- 3.6, p = 0.02; waist circumference -4.2 +/- 4.8 vs. 0.7 +/- 4.2, p < 0.01; BMI -0.2 +/- 0.8 vs. 0.6 +/- 1.6, p = 0.05). There were no between group differences in fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, insulin resistance or any other factors related to diabetes risk or psychological well-being. There were significant reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, anxiety, depression, negative affect and perceived stress in both the yoga intervention and walking control over the course of the study. CONCLUSION: Among Indians with elevated fasting blood glucose, we found that participation in an 8-week yoga intervention was feasible and resulted in greater weight loss and reduction in waist circumference when compared to a walking control. Yoga offers a promising lifestyle intervention for decreasing weight-related type 2 diabetes risk factors and potentially increasing psychological well-being.

24977005	Effects of yoga training in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	INTRODUCTION: Currently, several studies have assessed the effect of yoga training on the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but these studies involved a wide variation of sample and convey inconclusive results. Hence, the present study was performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy of yoga training in COPD patients. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched for relevant studies. The primary outcomes were forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), FEV1% predicted (% pred). Secondary outcomes included 6-min walking distance (6 MWD), arterial oxygen tension (PaO2), and arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2). Weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, and heterogeneity was assessed with the I(2) test. RESULTS: Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving 233 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Yoga training significantly improved FEV1 (WMD: 123.57 mL, 95% CI: 4.12-243, P=0.04), FEV1% pred (WMD: 3.90%, 95% CI: 2.27-5.54, P<0.00001), and 6 MWD (WMD: 38.84 m, 95% CI: 15.52-62.16, P=0.001). However, yoga training had no significant effects on PaO2 (WMD: 1.29 mmHg, 95% CI: -1.21-3.78, P=0.31) and PaCO2 (WMD: -0.76 mmHg, 95% CI: -2.06-0.53, P=0.25). CONCLUSIONS: The current limited evidence suggested that yoga training has a positive effect on improving lung function and exercise capacity and could be used as an adjunct pulmonary rehabilitation program in COPD patients. However, further studies are needed to substantiate our preliminary findings and to investigate the long-term effects of yoga training.

24975623	Meditation and mindfulness in clinical practice.	This article describes the various forms of meditation and provides an overview of research using these techniques for children, adolescents, and their families. The most researched techniques in children and adolescents are mindfulness-based stress reduction, mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, yoga meditation, transcendental meditation, mind-body techniques (meditation, relaxation), and body-mind techniques (yoga poses, tai chi movements). Current data are suggestive of a possible value of meditation and mindfulness techniques for treating symptomatic anxiety, depression, and pain in youth. Clinicians must be properly trained before using these techniques.	Simkin, Deborah R;Black, Nancy B	2014 Jul
24975229	Disentangling the neural mechanisms involved in Hinduism- and Buddhism-related meditations.	The most diffuse forms of meditation derive from Hinduism and Buddhism spiritual traditions. Different cognitive processes are set in place to reach these meditation states. According to an historical-philological hypothesis (Wynne, 2009) the two forms of meditation could be disentangled. While mindfulness is the focus of Buddhist meditation reached by focusing sustained attention on the body, on breathing and on the content of the thoughts, reaching an ineffable state of nothigness accompanied by a loss of sense of self and duality (Samadhi) is the main focus of Hinduism-inspired meditation. It is possible that these different practices activate separate brain networks. We tested this hypothesis by conducting an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. The network related to Buddhism-inspired meditation (16 experiments, 263 subjects, and 96 activation foci) included activations in some frontal lobe structures associated with executive attention, possibly confirming the fundamental role of mindfulness shared by many Buddhist meditations. By contrast, the network related to Hinduism-inspired meditation (8 experiments, 54 activation foci and 66 subjects) triggered a left lateralized network of areas including the postcentral gyrus, the superior parietal lobe, the hippocampus and the right middle cingulate cortex. The dissociation between anterior and posterior networks support the notion that different meditation styles and traditions are characterized by different patterns of neural activation.

26664239	Clinical study on the efficacy of Rajayapana Basti and Baladi Yoga in motor disabilities of cerebral palsy in children.	BACKGROUND: Cerebral palsy is a static encephalopathy that may be defined as a non-progressive disorder of posture and movement often associated with epilepsy and abnormalities in speech, vision and intellect resulting from a defect or lesion of the developing brain. There are 25 lakhs cerebral palsy affected children in India. AIM: To assess the efficacy of Rajayapana Basti (RB) and Baladi Yoga in motor disabilities of cerebral palsy in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total 98 children satisfying diagnostic criteria and between the age group of 2-10 years were included and randomly divided into two groups. In RB with Baladi group (n = 40) patients were treated with Mustadi Rajayapana Basti for 8 days, followed by oral administration of Baladi Yoga with honey and ghee for 60 days. Before administering Basti, patients were subjected to Sarvanga Abhyanga and Sastikashali Pinda Sveda. In the control group (n = 40), patients were given tablets of Godhuma Choorna for 60 days. Before administering the placebo tablet, the patients of the control group were given Sarvanga Abhyanga and Sastikashali Pinda Sveda for 8 days. The patients of the control group were given Basti with lukewarm water for 8 days. RESULTS: RB group has shown improvements in understanding ability (13.43%), speech (10%) and performance skill (11.11%), in fine motor functions such as putting small object in to a container (14.3%), throws the ball in all direction (21.8%), use of thumb and index finger (10.93%), retaining 2 inch cube in fist (19.04%), folds paper and inserts into envelope (10.30%), in gross motor functions such as in crawling (26.7%), sitting (31.7%), standing (13.75%), walking (9.5%) and claps hands (13.9%) respectively. CONCLUSION: Mustadi RB along with Baladi Yoga provided a significant improvement in all the parameters and has promising result in managing motor disabilities of cerebral palsy in children.

26664229	Importance of Manas Tattva: A searchlight in Yoga Darshana.	Since time immemorial 'Manas' has been the subject of curiosity for scholars, scientists and philosophers. The reason behind this curiosity is its importance in the development of mankind. Human being is superior to other creatures in the series of development. This supremacy of man remains in his quality to work after thinking, which is the function of 'Manas'. No other animal is capable to think logically. This is the only reason which leads the mankind to the crest of development in every aspect. To highlight the concept of Manas in Yoga Darshana, information extracted from Yoga literatures and Ayurvedic Samhitas. In Indian culture mind has been described from various angles. Vedic, Philosophical and Ayurvedic literatures have a vast and exclusive description of Manas. Philosophers either Astika or Nastika have described Manas Siddhanta vividly. Though many kinds of difference of opinions are there, Yoga Darshana accept the importance of mind in the process of perception and even for the birth of any individual.

24968577	Comparative study of effect of anuloma-viloma (pranayam) and yogic asanas in premenstrual syndrome.	The present study was planned to investigate the effects of Anuloma-viloma and specific yogic asanas in Premenstrual syndrome (PMS). The study group comprised of 60 females suffering from PMS between the age group of 18- 40 years, having 28-34 days regular menstrual cycle, further subdivided into 3 groups having equal number (n = 20) of subjects-group A (no intervention), group B (Anuloma-viloma) and group C (yogic asanas). Age-matched 30 healthy female subjects were taken as control. In all the subjects, a baseline recording of the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from the right arm was taken using an automated sphygmomanometer. The heart rate (HR/min), electromyogram (EMG; mV), galvanic skin response (GSR; komega), respiratory rate (RR/min), peripheral temperature (T; degrees F), were recorded simultaneously, on an automated biofeedback apparatus Relax 701. The subjects of group A and group B performed yogic exercises, regularly for 7 days prior to the expected date of menstruation for 3 consecutive menstrual cycles. The parameters were recorded again at the end of 7 days in each menstrual cycle. We observed that, in the group A and group B, HR, SBP, DBP, EMG, GSR and RR showed a very significant reduction (P < 0.001) and T rose more significantly (P < 0.001) after the 3rd menstrual cycle, when compared with their basal levels. On computing the percentage difference between the baseline and post values in all the three groups and than comparing this percentage difference, we found a y significant difference (P < 0.05) between the groups. In the present study, the relaxation response in the females suffering from PMS showed a reduction in an abnormally high basal sympathetic activity and a heightened relaxation response in both the study groups (group B and Group C) in comparison with group A.

24968492	Effect of short-term practice of pranayamic breathing exercises on cognition, anxiety, general well being and heart rate variability.	There has been an increasing interest in pranayamic breathing exercises which have been known to improve the quality of life. Present study was conducted to find out the effect of Bhastrika and Anulom Vilom Pranayam and yogasana on heart rate variability, general well being, cognition and anxiety levels of the medical students. Ninety-six medical students were randomly divided into two groups. One group performed Bhastrika and Anulom Vilom Pranayam and the second Suryanamaskar for six weeks. The subjects were made to fill in PGI memory scale, Hamilton- anxiety scale and psychological general well being schedule and recording of heart rate variability parameters was done, before and after six weeks of pranayam practice. The results showed highly significant increase in high frequency (HF) components of heart rate variability and decrease in low frequency (LF) components and LF/HF inthe group practising pranayam. There was also highly significant improvement of cognition, general well being and anxiety as shown by the PGI memory scale, Hamilton- anxiety scale and psychological general well being schedule scores in this group. In the yogasana group no significant changes were observed in the heart rate variability, cognition and anxiety although psychological general well being schedule scores significantly improved after six weeks practice of yogasana. The study shows that practice of slow breathing type of pranayam for six weeks improves cognition, anxiety and general well being and Increases the parasympathetic activity. Whereas there was no effect of the yogasana on the above parameters except improvements in the general well being.	Chandla, S S;Sood, S;Dogra, R;Das, S;Shukla, S K;Gupta, Sanjay	2013 Oct
24963220	Yoga and health.	Yoga has been the subject of research in the past few decades for therapeutic purposes for modern epidemic diseases like mental stress, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Individual studies report beneficial effect of yoga in these conditions, indicating that it can be used as nonpharmaceutical measure or complement to drug therapy for treatment of these conditions. However, these studies have used only yoga asana, pranayama, and/ or short periods of meditation for therapeutic purposes. General perception about yoga is also the same, which is not correct. Yoga in fact means union of individual consciousness with the supreme consciousness. It involves eight rungs or limbs of yoga, which include yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana, and samadhi. Intense practice of these leads to self-realization, which is the primary goal of yoga. An analytical look at the rungs and the goal of yoga shows that it is a holistic way of life leading to a state of complete physical, social, mental, and spiritual well-being and harmony with nature. This is in contrast to purely economic and material developmental goal of modern civilization, which has brought social unrest and ecological devastation.	Taneja, Davendra Kumar	2014 Apr
24959124	Low and then high frequency oscillations of distinct right cortical networks are progressively enhanced by medium and long term Satyananda Yoga meditation practice.	Meditation proficiency is related to trait-like (learned) effects on brain function, developed over time. Previous studies show increases in EEG power in lower frequency bands (theta, alpha) in experienced meditators in both meditation states and baseline conditions. Higher gamma band power has been found in advanced Buddhist meditators, yet it is not known if this occurs in Yoga meditation practices. This study used eLORETA to compare differences in cortical source activity underlying scalp EEG from intermediate (mean experience 4 years) and advanced (mean experience 30 years) Australian meditators from the Satyananda Yoga tradition during a body-steadiness meditation, mantra meditation, and non-meditation mental calculation condition. Intermediate Yoga meditators showed greater source activity in low frequencies (particularly theta and alpha1) during mental calculation, body-steadiness and mantra meditation. A similar spatial pattern of significant differences was found in all conditions but the number of significant voxels was double during body-steadiness and mantra meditation than in the non-meditation (calculation) condition. These differences were greatest in right (R) superior frontal and R precentral gyri and extended back to include the R parietal and occipital lobes. Advanced Yoga meditators showed greater activity in high frequencies (beta and especially gamma) in all conditions but greatly expanded during meditation practice. Across all conditions (meditation and non-meditation) differences were greatest in the same regions: R insula, R inferior frontal gyrus and R anterior temporal lobe. Distinct R core networks were identified in alpha1 (8-10 Hz) and gamma (25-42 Hz) bands, respectively. The voxels recruited to these networks greatly expanded during meditation practice to include homologous regions of the left hemisphere. Functional interpretation parallels traditionally described stages of development in Yoga proficiency.	Thomas, John;Jamieson, Graham;Cohen, Marc	2014
24955291	Yoga and eating disorders: is there a place for yoga in the prevention and treatment of eating disorders and disordered eating behaviours?	THIS PAPER ADDRESSES THE QUESTION: what can the practice of yoga offer the field of eating disorders in terms of prevention and treatment? Regarding prevention, preliminary research suggests that yoga may be effective in decreasing risk factors, and increasing protective factors, for eating disorders. Yoga was also found to be helpful in a small number of treatment studies. However, findings are not consistent across studies, which are limited in number, and due to the preliminary nature of this body of research, most studies have weaknesses in their designs (e.g. observational design, no control groups, or small sample sizes). The basic tenets of yoga, anecdotal reports of its effectiveness, its high accessibility and low cost, and initial research findings suggest that yoga may offer promise for the field of eating disorders. Two options are suggested for prevention: (1) eating disorder prevention can be integrated into ongoing yoga classes and (2) yoga can be integrated into eating disorder prevention programmes. Regarding treatment, it is important to examine the effectiveness of different teaching styles and practices for different eating disorders. Potential harms of yoga should also be explored. Further research, using stronger study designs, such as randomised, controlled trials, is needed.	Neumark-Sztainer, Dianne	2014 Jul

24942270	Establishing key components of yoga interventions for musculoskeletal conditions: a Delphi survey.	BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests yoga is a safe and effective intervention for the management of physical and psychosocial symptoms associated with musculoskeletal conditions. However, heterogeneity in the components and reporting of clinical yoga trials impedes both the generalization of study results and the replication of study protocols. The aim of this Delphi survey was to address these issues of heterogeneity, by developing a list of recommendations of key components for the design and reporting of yoga interventions for musculoskeletal conditions. METHODS: Recognised experts involved in the design, conduct, and teaching of yoga for musculoskeletal conditions were identified from a systematic review, and invited to contribute to the Delphi survey. Forty-one of the 58 experts contacted, representing six countries, agreed to participate. A three-round Delphi was conducted via electronic surveys. Round 1 presented an open-ended question, allowing panellists to individually identify components they considered key to the design and reporting of yoga interventions for musculoskeletal conditions. Thematic analysis of Round 1 identified items for quantitative rating in Round 2; items not reaching consensus were forwarded to Round 3 for re-rating. RESULTS: Thirty-six panellists (36/41; 88%) completed the three rounds of the Delphi survey. Panellists provided 348 comments to the Round 1 question. These comments were reduced to 49 items, grouped under five themes, for rating in subsequent rounds. A priori group consensus of >/=80% was reached on 28 items related to five themes concerning defining the yoga intervention, types of yoga practices to include in an intervention, delivery of the yoga protocol, domains of outcome measures, and reporting of yoga interventions for musculoskeletal conditions. Additionally, a priori consensus of >/=50% was reached on five items relating to minimum values for intervention parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Expert consensus has provided a non-prescriptive reference list for the design and reporting of yoga interventions for musculoskeletal conditions. It is anticipated future research incorporating the Delphi guidelines will facilitate high quality international research in this field, increase homogeneity of intervention components and parameters, and enhance the comparison and reproducibility of research into the use of yoga for the management of musculoskeletal conditions.

24938424	The feasibility and benefits of a 12-week yoga intervention for pediatric cancer out-patients.	BACKGROUND: Increasing rates of survival present a new set of psychosocial and physical challenges for children undergoing treatment for cancer. Physical activity (PA) has been shown to be a safe and effective strategy to mitigate the significant burden of cancer and its treatments, with yoga increasingly gaining recognition as a gentle alternative. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and benefits of a 12-week community-based yoga intervention on health-related quality of life (HRQL), select physical fitness outcomes and PA levels (PAL). PROCEDURE: Eight pediatric cancer out-patients (4 male; 4 female; Mage = 11.88, SD = 4.26) participated in the 12-week intervention consisting of supervised yoga sessions 2 times/week. Participants (patients and parent proxies) completed measures assessing HRQL, physical fitness and PAL at baseline and post-intervention. RESULTS: Rates of recruitment, retention, attendance and adverse events indicated the program was feasible. Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests indicated significant improvements for patient (P = 0.02) and parent reported HRQL (P = 0.03), functional mobility (P = 0.01), hamstring flexibility (left, P = 0.01 and right P = 0.02), and total PAL (P = 0.02) pre to post intervention. CONCLUSION: This 12-week community-based yoga intervention was feasible and provides preliminary evidence for the benefits of yoga on HRQL, physical fitness and PAL in pediatric cancer out-patients. In a population where sedentary behavior and the associated co-morbidities are a growing concern, these results promote the continued exploration of yoga programming.

24937018	Testing the efficacy of yoga as a complementary therapy for smoking cessation: design and methods of the BreathEasy trial.	INTRODUCTION: Smokers trying to quit encounter many challenges including nicotine withdrawal symptoms, cigarette craving, increased stress and negative mood and concern regarding weight gain. These phenomena make it difficult to successfully quit smoking. Studies in non-smoking populations show that yoga reduces stress and negative mood and improves weight control. By increasing mindfulness we anticipate that yoga may also improve smokers' ability to cope with the negative symptoms associated with quitting. Yoga may also improve cognitive deliberation which is needed to make effective choices and avoid smoking in tempting situations. METHODS/DESIGN: The BreathEasy study is a rigorous, randomized controlled clinical trial examining the efficacy of Iyengar yoga as a complementary therapy to cognitive-behavioral therapy for smoking cessation. All participants are given an 8-week program of smoking cessation classes, and are randomized to either twice weekly yoga (Yoga) or twice-weekly health and wellness classes which serve as a control for contact and participant burden (CTL). Assessments are conducted at baseline, 8 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up. The primary outcome is prolonged abstinence using an intention-to-treat approach. Multiple internal and external audits using blind data collection are employed to ensure treatment fidelity and reliability of study results. To understand why yoga may be more effective than CTL, we will examine the mechanisms of action (i.e., mediators) underlying intervention efficacy. We will examine the maintenance of yoga practice and smoking status at each follow-up. Focus groups and interviews will be used to enrich our understanding of the relationship of yoga practice and smoking abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide a stringent test of the relative efficacy of yoga compared to a condition that controls for contact time and attention. The use of mixed methodology also provides the opportunity to validate existing knowledge about yoga and helps to explore new themes for future mindfulness and yoga research.

24926629	A randomised controlled trial of the effects of Brain Wave Vibration training on mood and well-being.	BACKGROUND: The goal was to investigate the effects of Brain Wave Vibration (BWV), a meditation practised in a class involving rhythmic movements of the head, neck and body practised with related yoga-style exercises, and to isolate the rhythmic effects. METHODS: A randomised controlled trial was conducted with assessments pre- and post-trial and immediately before and after each session. Thirty-one healthy adults were assessed for mood, sleep, mindfulness, health and well-being, and pre- and post-class activation-deactivation. Participants were randomly assigned to either BWV in toto or a control group having similar yoga exercises without the rhythmic components. Participants completed eight to twelve 75-min classes of BWV or control training over 8-12 weeks. To control for expectation participants were told only that the aim was to compare two subtly different styles of Korean yoga. RESULTS: The BWV group had comparatively greater improvements in sleep duration and efficiency, although they had higher baseline inefficiency, and post-trial they had better global sleep and well-being and fewer illness symptoms, and better tiredness and energy post-class. Both groups benefitted in mood, mindfulness and vitality post-trial with improved tension and calmness post-class. CONCLUSIONS: The participants of both interventions had better mood and well-being on the whole following the trial and were more relaxed immediately after a class. However, BWV training was unique in its benefits to sleep, health, well-being, energy and tiredness, warranting further research.	Bowden, Deborah E;McLennan, Danielle;Gruzelier, John	2014 Sep
24919720	Yoga in addition to standard care for patients with haematological malignancies.	BACKGROUND: Haematological malignancies are malignant neoplasms of the myeloid or lymphatic cell lines including leukaemia, lymphoma and myeloma. In order to manage physical and psychological aspects of the disease and its treatment, complementary therapies like yoga are coming increasingly into focus. However, the effectiveness of yoga practice for people suffering from haematological malignancies remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of yoga practice in addition to standard cancer treatment for people with haematological malignancies. SEARCH METHODS: Our search strategy included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950 to 4th February 2014), databases of ongoing trials (controlled-trials.com; clinicaltrials.gov), conference proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the American Society of Hematology, the European Haematology Association, the European Congress for Integrative Medicine, and Global Advances in Health and Medicine. We handsearched references of these studies from identified trials and relevant review articles. Two review authors independently screened the search results. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of yoga in addition to standard care for haematological malignancies compared with standard care only. We did not restrict this to any specific style of yoga. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data for eligible studies and assessed the risk of bias according to predefined criteria. We evaluated distress, fatigue, anxiety, depression and quality of sleep. Further outcomes we planned to assess were health-related quality of life (HRQoL), overall survival (OS) and adverse events (AE), but data on these were not available. MAIN RESULTS: Our search strategies led to 149 potentially relevant references, but only a single small study met our inclusion criteria. The included study was published as a full text article and investigated the feasibility and effect of Tibetan Yoga additional to standard care (N = 20; 1 person dropped out before attending any classes and no data were collected) compared to standard care only (N = 19). The study included people with all stages of Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with and without current cancer treatment. The mean age was 51 years.We judged the overall risk of bias as high as we found a high risk for performance, detection and attrition bias. Additionally, potential outcome reporting bias could not be completely ruled out. Following the recommendations of GRADE, we judged the overall quality of the body of evidence for all predefined outcomes as 'very low', due to the methodical limitations and the very small sample size.The influence of yoga on HRQoL and OS was not reported. There is no evidence that yoga in addition to standard care compared with standard care only can improve distress in people with haematological malignancies (mean difference (MD) -0.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.55 to 4.95; P = 0.91). Similarly, there is no evidence of a difference between either group for fatigue (MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.94 to 0.94; P = 1.00), anxiety (MD 0.30, 95% CI -5.01 to 5.61; P = 0.91) or depression (MD -0.70, 95% CI -3.21 to 1.81; P = 0.58).There is very low quality evidence that yoga improves the overall quality of sleep (MD -2.30, 95% CI -3.78 to -0.82; P = 0.002). The yoga groups' total score for the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was 5.8 (+/- 2.3 SD) and better than the total score (8.1 (+/- 2.4 SD)) of the control group. A PSQI total score of 0 to 5 indicates good sleep whereas PSQI total score 6 to 21 points towards significant sleep disturbances. The occurrence of AEs was not reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The currently available data provide little information about the effectiveness of yoga interventions for people suffering from haematological malignancies. The finding that yoga may be beneficial for the patients' quality of sleep is based on a very small body of evidence. Therefore, the role of yoga as an additional therapy for haematological malignancies remains unclear. Further high-quality randomised controlled trials with larger numbers of participants are needed to make a definitive statement.

24919631	Learning from the patient: the East, synchronicity and transference in the history of an unknown case of C.G. Jung.	This article presents the history of one until now unknown case of C.G. Jung: Maggy Reichstein. Born in Indonesia in 1894 in a very aristocratic family, she brought her sister to Zurich to be treated by Jung in 1919, and later she herself was in analysis with him. Jung used her case as example in his lecture in 1937 on the realities of practical psychotherapy, relating it to the process of transference and countertransference. Jung deepened his studies in Eastern psychology after a series of dreams she had, which culminated in the Yoga Kundalini Seminars. She was also the case presented in his article of 1951 on the concept of synchronicity. Jung wrote that her case, concerning synchronicity, remained unique in his experience. Jung also published some of her mandalas. He considered her able to understand his ideas in depth. Reichstein was for Jung an important case, which challenged and triggered his interests in different subjects.	de Moura, Vicente	2014 Jun

24906591	Yoga for hypertension: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials.	OBJECTIVES: To critically evaluate the effectiveness of yoga as a treatment of hypertension. METHODS: Seventeen databases were searched from their inceptions to January 2014. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were included, if they evaluated yoga against any type of control in patients with any form of arterial hypertension. Risk of bias was estimated using the Cochrane criteria. Three independent reviewers performed the selection of studies, data extraction, and quality assessments. RESULTS: Seventeen trials met the inclusion criteria. Only two RCTs were of acceptable methodological quality. Eleven RCTs suggested that yoga leads to a significantly greater reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) compared to various forms of pharmacotherapy, breath awareness or reading, health education, no treatment (NT), or usual care (UC). Eight RCTs suggested that yoga leads to a significantly greater reduction in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) or night-time DBP compared to pharmacotherapy, NT, or UC. Five RCTs indicated that yoga had no effect on SBP compared to dietary modification (DIM), enhanced UC, passive relaxation (PR), or physical exercises (PE). Eight RCTs indicated that yoga had no effect on DBP compared to DIM, enhanced UC, pharmacotherapy, NT, PE, PR, or breath awareness or reading. One RCT did not report between-group comparisons. CONCLUSION: The evidence for the effectiveness of yoga as a treatment of hypertension is encouraging but inconclusive. Further, more rigorous trials seem warranted.

24906582	Yoga as an adjunct treatment for alcohol dependence: a pilot study.	OBJECTIVES: This pilot study explores the feasibility of yoga as part of a treatment program for alcohol dependence. DESIGN: Eighteen alcohol dependent patients were randomized to receive either treatment as usual or treatment as usual plus yoga. Assessments were taken at baseline and six month follow-up. SETTING: 'Riddargatan 1': an outpatient alcohol treatment clinic located in Stockholm, Sweden. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment as usual consisted of psychological and pharmacological interventions for alcohol dependence. The 10-week yoga intervention included a weekly group yoga session. Participants were encouraged to practice the yoga movements at home once per day. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Alcohol consumption (timeline follow-back method, DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence, and the Short Alcohol Dependence Data questionnaire), affective symptoms (the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), quality of life (Sheehan Disability Scale) and stress (the Perceived Stress Scale and saliva cortisol). RESULTS: Yoga was found to be a feasible and well accepted adjunct treatment for alcohol dependence. Alcohol consumption reduced more in the treatment as usual plus yoga group (from 6.32 to 3.36 drinks per day) compared to the treatment as usual only group (from 3.42 to 3.08 drinks per day). The difference was, however, not statistically significant (p = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS: Larger studies are needed to adequately assess the efficacy and long-term effectiveness of yoga as an adjunct treatment for alcohol dependence.

24906581	A comparison of the effects of hatha yoga and resistance exercise on mental health and well-being in sedentary adults: a pilot study.	OBJECTIVES: Physical activity has a positive effect on people's mental health and well-being. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of hatha yoga and resistance exercises on mental health and well-being in sedentary adults. DESIGN: Randomized controlled study. METHODS: Fifty-one participants aged mean (SD) 25.6 (5.7) years were randomly divided into three groups: Hatha Yoga Group, Resistance Exercise Group and Control Group. The Hatha Yoga Group and Resistance Exercise Group participated in sessions three days per week for 7 weeks and the Control Group did not participate in any sessions. All the subjects were evaluated through the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Body Cathexis Scale, Nottingham Health Profile and Visual Analog Scale for fatigue pre-and post-session. RESULTS: Significant improvements were found in terms of all outcome measures in the Hatha Yoga Group and the resistance exercise group. No improvements were found in the Control Group. Hatha yoga more improved the dimensions fatigue, self-esteem, and quality of life, whilst resistance exercise training more improved body image. Hatha yoga and resistance exercise decreased depression symptoms at a similar level. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that hatha yoga and resistance exercise had positive effects on mental health and well-being in sedentary adults. Hatha yoga and resistance exercise may affect different aspects of mental health and well-being.	Taspinar, Betul;Aslan, Ummuhan Bas;Agbuga, Bulent;Taspinar, Ferruh	2014 Jun

24904047	Musculoskeletal symptoms and orthopaedic complications in pregnancy: pathophysiology, diagnostic approaches and modern management.	Low back pain is a common musculoskeletal symptom in pregnancy that can present as lumbar pain or pelvic girdle pain, with significant physical and psychosocial implications. Pelvic girdle pain is more prevalent and results in greater disability than lumbar pain. It is possible to distinguish between these two conditions from a detailed history based on the site of the pain, its intensity, disability and pain provocation tests. Management of low back pain in pregnancy is conservative, with physical exercise for lumbar pain and minimising activities that exacerbate pain, analgesics and bed rest for pelvic girdle pain, as well as avoiding abduction beyond the pain-free zone in labour. There is evidence that stabilising exercises in patients with pelvic girdle pain postpartum have a beneficial effect. Other treatment modalities that have been shown to be safe and effective include pelvic belts, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, spinal manipulative therapy, acupuncture and complementary therapy with yoga. Other orthopaedic complications in pregnancy such as carpal tunnel syndrome, pubic symphysis rupture, transient osteoporosis and osteonecrosis are usually self-limiting with a satisfactory outcome. However, a lack of awareness and failure to recognise these complications can result in long-term morbidity. Knowledge of the preoperative diagnostic investigations, surgical approaches and intraoperative positioning of the mother to avoid gravid uterus compression is vital in orthopaedic emergencies such as lumbar disc herniation, cauda equina syndrome, fractures and acute compartment syndrome of the lower limb to ensure a safe maternal and fetal outcome and to prevent serious disability. Pregnancy is not contraindicated in women with pre-existing orthopaedic complications such as kyphoscoliosis and total hip arthroplasty as there is no evidence to suggest increased maternal or fetal risks.

24899906	Effect of regular yogic training on growth hormone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate as an endocrine marker of aging.	Growth hormone (GH) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) secretion decline with advancing age and are associated with the symptoms of aging. Yogic texts claimed that regular practice of yoga may restore and maintain general endocrinological properties in the human body. Objective of the Study. To observe the effect of yogic training for twelve weeks on basal level of GH and DHEAS in middle aged group. Method. Forty-five untrained volunteers were divided into two groups, that is, yoga practicing (experimental: male 15, age 42.80 +/- 7.43 yrs; female 8, age 44.75 +/- 8.40 yrs) and waitlisted control group (male 15, age 41.67 +/- 7.87 yrs; female 7, age 45.43 +/- 7.00 yrs). The experimental group underwent combined yogic practices daily in the morning for 6 days/week for 12 weeks, whereas control group continued their usual routine activities. Standing height, body weight, body mass index, and basal level of GH and DHEAS were measured before commencement and after six and twelve weeks of yogic training period. The repeated measure ANOVA was used for data analysis. Results. 12 weeks of yogic training produces a significant increase in GH and DHEAS for both male and female groups as compared to their baseline data, whereas no as such changes were observed in the control group. Conclusion. Combined approach of graded yogic training may be beneficial for maintaining the basal level of GH and DHEAS in the human body, thus promoting healthy aging.

24894436	Peer volunteers in an integrative pain management program for frail older adults with chronic pain: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is common among the older population. A literature review on pain management program showed that exercise, yoga, massage therapy, Tai Chi, and music therapy could significantly reduce pain. In spite of the proven benefits of pain management programs, these intervention programs were effective only in the short term, and older adults would resume their old habits. It has been suggested that interventions comprising some type of social support have great potential to increase the participation of older adults. Therefore, we propose the inclusion of peer volunteers in an integrated pain management program to relieve pain among frail older adults. This study aims to explore the effectiveness of an integrated pain management program supplemented with peer volunteers in improving pain intensity, functional mobility, physical activity, loneliness levels, happiness levels, and the use of non-pharmacological pain-relieving methods among frail older adults with chronic pain. METHODS/DESIGN: We intend to recruit 30 nursing home residents and 30 peer volunteers from the Institute of Active Ageing in Hong Kong in a group trial for an 8-week group-based integrated pain management program. There will be 16 sessions, with two 1-hour sessions each week.The primary outcome will be pain levels, while secondary outcomes will be assessed according to functional mobility, physical activity, loneliness levels, happiness levels, the use of non-pharmacological pain-relieving methods, and through a questionnaire for volunteers. DISCUSSION: In view of the high prevalence of chronic pain among older adults and its adverse impacts, it is important to provide older adults with tools to control their pain. We propose the use of peer volunteers to enhance the effects of an integrated pain management program. It is expected that pain can be reduced and improvements can be achieved among older adults in the areas of physical activity, functional mobility, loneliness levels, happiness levels, and the use of non-pharmacological pain relieving methods. Using these results, we will assess the need to conduct a larger study with a randomized controlled design. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered on 24 February 2014 at the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) with the trial number: ACTRN12614000195651.

24893766	Antipruritic effects of the probiotic strain LKM512 in adults with atopic dermatitis.	BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that intestinal microbiota play an important role in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD) through induction of immunosuppression and immune tolerance; however, the exact underlying mechanism is unclear. Few studies to date have examined the effects of probiotics on adult-type AD. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of the probiotic Bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis LKM512 on adult-type AD and the expression of metabolites that are known to be influenced by gut microbiota in fecal samples. METHODS: Forty-four patients were randomly assigned to receive LKM512 or a placebo and underwent medical examinations. Fecal microbiota were analyzed with real-time polymerase chain reaction. Metabolomic analysis was conducted to search for antipruritic metabolites produced by intestinal bacteria using feces derived from 3 patients whose itch scores had improved using capillary electrophoresis with time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Antipruritic effects of kynurenic acid were observed using AD-induced NC/Nga mice. RESULTS: LKM512 administration alleviated itch in AD patients compared with controls and improved the dermatology-specific quality-of-life scores when compared with the controls. Administration of LKM512 also increased the expression of the antipruritic and antinociceptive metabolite kynurenic acid (KYNA) in patients whose itch score had improved after LKM512 treatment. In mouse experiments, scratching behavior counts tended to be decreased by KYNA injection when compared with no treatment. CONCLUSION: LKM512 administration may exert antipruritic effects by increasing KYNA production. LKM512 could therefore be a potentially effective therapeutic candidate for the reduction of pruritus.

24891803	Stress and its Expression According to Contemporary Science and Ancient Indian Wisdom: Perseverative Cognition and the Panca kosas.	Stress is recognised as the most challenging issue of modern times. Contemporary science has understood this phenomenon from one aspect and Indian philosophy gives its traditional reasons based on classical texts. Modern science has recently proposed a concept of perseverative cognition (PC) as an important reason for chronic stress. This has shown how constant rumination on an unpalatable event, object or person leads to various lifestyle disorders. Similarly classical yoga texts like the Taittiriya Upanishad, the Bhagavad Gita, and the Yoga Vashistha describe stress in their unique ways. We have here attempted a detailed classification, description, manifestation, and development of a disease and its management through these models. This paper in a nutshell projects these two models of stress and shows how they could be used in future for harmonious management of lifestyle disorders.

24888209	Examining mechanisms of change in a yoga intervention for women: the influence of mindfulness, psychological flexibility, and emotion regulation on PTSD symptoms.	OBJECTIVE: This study explored possible mechanisms through which symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were reduced in a randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of a yoga intervention with an assessment control. METHOD: We examined whether changes in psychological flexibility, mindfulness, and emotion regulation strategies (expressive suppression and reappraisal) were associated with posttreatment PTSD symptoms for 38 women with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition full or subthreshold PTSD. RESULTS: Hierarchical linear regression models revealed that expressive suppression significantly decreased for the yoga group relative to the assessment control. Psychological flexibility increased significantly for the control but not yoga group. However, increases in psychological flexibility were associated with decreases in PTSD symptoms for the yoga but not control group. CONCLUSION: Preliminary findings suggest that yoga may reduce expressive suppression and may improve PTSD symptoms by increasing psychological flexibility. More research is needed to replicate and extend these findings.	Dick, Alexandra M;Niles, Barbara L;Street, Amy E;DiMartino, Dawn M;Mitchell, Karen S	2014 Dec
24886638	Yoga for managing knee osteoarthritis in older women: a pilot randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common problem in older women that is associated with pain and disabilities. Although yoga is recommended as an exercise intervention to manage arthritis, there is limited evidence documenting its effectiveness, with little known about its long term benefits. This study's aims were to assess the feasibility and potential efficacy of a Hatha yoga exercise program in managing OA-related symptoms in older women with knee OA. METHODS: Eligible participants (N=36; mean age 72 years) were randomly assigned to 8-week yoga program involving group and home-based sessions or wait-list control. The yoga intervention program was developed by a group of yoga experts (N=5). The primary outcome was the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) total score that measures knee OA pain, stiffness, and function at 8 weeks. The secondary outcomes, physical function of the lower extremities, body mass index (BMI), quality of sleep (QOS), and quality of life (QOL), were measured using weight, height, the short physical performance battery (SPPB), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Cantril Self-Anchoring Ladder, and the SF12v2 Health Survey. Data were collected at baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks, and 20 weeks. RESULTS: The recruitment target was met, with study retention at 95%. Based on ANCOVAs, participants in the treatment group exhibited significantly greater improvement in WOMAC pain (adjusted means [SE]) (8.3 [.67], 5.8 [.67]; p=.01), stiffness (4.7 [.28], 3.4 [.28]; p=.002) and SPPB (repeated chair stands) (2.0 [.23], 2.8 [.23]; p=.03) at 8 weeks. Significant treatment and time effects were seen in WOMAC pain (7.0 [.46], 5.4 [.54]; p=.03), function (24.5 [1.8], 19.9 [1.6]; p=.01) and total scores (35.4 [2.3], 28.6 [2.1]; p=.01) from 4 to 20 weeks. Sleep disturbance was improved but the PSQI total score declined significantly at 20 weeks. Changes in BMI and QOL were not significant. No yoga related adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A weekly yoga program with home practice is feasible, acceptable, and safe for older women with knee OA, and shows therapeutic benefits.

24879038	Associations between attention, affect and cardiac activity in a single yoga session for female cancer survivors: an enactive neurophenomenology-based approach.	Yoga practice is reported to lead to improvements in quality of life, psychological functioning, and symptom indices in cancer survivors. Importantly, meditative states experienced within yoga practice are correlated to neurophysiological systems that moderate both focus of attention and affective valence. The current study used a mixed methods approach based in neurophenomenology to investigate associations between attention, affect, and cardiac activity during a single yoga session for female cancer survivors. Yoga practice was associated with a linear increase in associative attention and positive affective valence, while shifts in cardiac activity were related to the intensity of each yoga sequence. Changes in attention and affect were predicted by concurrently assessed cardiac activity. Awareness of breathing, physical movement, and increased relaxation were reported by participants as potential mechanisms for yoga's salutary effects. While yoga practice shares commonalities with exercise and relaxation training, yoga may serve primarily as a promising meditative attention-affect regulation training methodology.

24878827	A comparative controlled trial comparing the effects of yoga and walking for overweight and obese adults.	BACKGROUND: Walking and yoga have been independently evaluated for weight control; however, there are very few studies comparing the 2 with randomization. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The present study compared the effects of 90 minutes/day for 15 days of supervised yoga or supervised walking on: (i) related biochemistry, (ii) anthropometric variables, (iii) body composition, (iv) postural stability, and (v) bilateral hand grip strength in overweight and obese persons. Sixty-eight participants, of whom 5 were overweight (BMI >/=25 kg/m2) and 63 were obese (BMI >/=30 kg/m2; group mean age +/-S.D., 36.4+/-11.2 years; 35 females), were randomized as 2 groups - (i) a yoga group and (ii) a walking group - given the same diet. RESULTS: All differences were pre-post changes within each group. Both groups showed a significant (p<0.05; repeated measures ANOVA, post-hoc analyses) decrease in: BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference, lean mass, body water, and total cholesterol. The yoga group increased serum leptin (p<0.01) and decreased LDL cholesterol (p<0.05). The walking group decreased serum adiponectin (p<0.05) and triglycerides (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Both yoga and walking improved anthropometric variables and serum lipid profile in overweight and obese persons. The possible implications are discussed.

26770098	Yoga as Therapy for Neurodegenerative Disorders: A Case Report of Therapeutic Yoga for Adrenomyeloneuropathy.	Yoga is a promising therapeutic modality for neurodegenerative diseases. This case study presents a therapeutic yoga protocol for adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) and its effect on a patient's quality of life (QOL), agility, balance, and peripheral dexterity. A 61-y-old man diagnosed with AMN who was experiencing (1) peripheral neuropathy in his legs and feet, (2) lower-back pain (LBP), and (3) osteoarthritis received 60-min weekly therapeutic yoga sessions for a 10-mo period. Yoga therapy included hatha yoga asanas (poses) and pranayama (breathing exercises). Hatha yoga asanas were aligned with 7 Berg Balance Scale (BBS) indicators to measure improvement in balance and range of motion. The 10-mo course of therapeutic yoga resulted in improved LBP; improved flexion of the patient's hips, knees, and ankles; improved propulsion phase of walking; and improvement in the patient's ability to stand and balance without an assistive device. The effect of yoga therapy on the patient in this case study aligns with current QOL improvements noted in current research on yoga therapy for neurological disorders. The described concepts and methods of employing therapeutic yoga provide insights for clinicians into a modality that is low risk and low cost and that can support individuals with other neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), fibromyalgia (FM), and diseases of the peripheral nervous system. Further study is warranted to help determine the safety and efficacy of yoga therapy for these conditions.	Muhammad, Charlene Marie;Moonaz, Steffany Haaz	2014 Jun
26327853	Effect of a 10-week yoga programme on the quality of life of women after breast cancer surgery.	AIM OF THE STUDY: The following research is aimed at determining the effect of yoga on the quality of life of women after breast cancer surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 10-week yoga programme included 90-minute yoga lessons once a week. To estimate the quality of life, questionnaires developed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23) were used. An experimental group consisted of 12 women who practised yoga, a control group - of 16 women who did not. Between groups there were no differences in age, time from operation and characteristics associated with disease, treatment and participation in rehabilitation. RESULTS: Our results revealed an improvement of general health and quality of life, physical and social functioning as well as a reduction of difficulties in daily activities among exercising women. Also their future prospects enhanced - they worried less about their health than they used to before participating in the programme. As compared to baseline, among exercising women, fatigue, dyspnoea and discomfort (pain, swelling, sensitivity) in the arm and breast on the operated side decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in the exercising programme resulted in an improvement of physical functioning, reduction of fatigue, dyspnoea, and discomfort in the area of the breast and arm on the operated side. Based on our results and those obtained in foreign studies, we conclude that rehabilitation with the use of yoga practice improves the quality of life of the patients after breast cancer surgery. However, we recommend further research on this issue in Poland.	Andysz, Aleksandra;Merecz, Dorota;Wojcik, Aleksandra;Swiatkowska, Beata;Sierocka, Kamilla;Najder, Anna	2014 Jun
24873115	The role of yoga: breathing, meditation and optimal fetal positioning.	Yoga is considered a good form of exercise in pregnancy (NHS Choices recommend exercise such as yoga, amongst others) to help women keep fit during their pregnancy and prepare for the birth. But apart from the physical postures, yoga has plenty to offer. The breathing and meditation techniques keep pregnant mothers healthy and relaxed, and provide the mental focus to aid childbirth. In this article we look at yogic breathing and meditation techniques for midwives to recommend to expectant mothers, and some postures that specifically help to encourage an optimal fetal position.

24872933	Exploratory study on the ayurvedic therapeutic management of cerebral palsy in children at a tertiary care hospital of karnataka, India.	Cerebral palsy (CP) is the leading cause of childhood disability affecting cognitive function and developments in approximately 1.5 to 3 cases per 1000 live births. Based on Ayurvedic therapeutic principles, CP patients were subjected to Abhyanga (massage) with Moorchita Tila Taila (processed sesame oil) and Svedana (fomentation) with Shastikashali Pinda Sveda (fomentation with bolus of drugs prepared with boiled rice). Study group received Mustadi Rajayapana Basti (enema with herbal decoction) and Baladi Yoga (a poly-herbo-mineral formulation), while the placebo group received Godhuma Vati (tablet prepared with wheat powder) and saline water as enema. Treatment with Mustadi Rajayapana Basti and Baladi Yoga improved the activities of daily life by 8.79%, gross motor functions by 19.76%, and fine motor functions 15.05%, and mental functions like memory retention got improved by 15.43%. The placebo group showed an improvement of 0.21% in daily life activities, 2.8% in gross motor, and 2.4% in fine motor functions. Mustadi Rajayapana Basti and Baladi Yoga proved to be more supportive in improving the motor activities and gross behavioral pattern. Further clinical trials are required to evaluate and validate the maximum effect of the combination therapy in a large sample with repetition of the courses for longer duration.

24867852	Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use in an Italian cohort of pediatric headache patients: the tip of the iceberg.	The use of complementary alternative medicine (CAM) in paediatric populations is considerably increased, especially for pain and chronic conditions, as demonstrated by epidemiological surveys both in Europe and in the USA. In our study, CAM was used in 76 % patients of a cohort of 124 children affected by headache (age 4-16 years; 67 % female; 70 % migraine without aura, 12 % migraine with aura, 18 % tensive headache according to IHS criteria) consecutively recruited at a Pediatric Headache University Center. CAM was used as preventive treatment in 80 % cases. The main reasons for seeking CAM were: the wish of avoiding chronic use of drugs with their related side effects, the desire of an integrated approach, the reported inefficacy of conventional medicine, and a more suitable children disposition to CAM than to pharmacological compound. Female gender, younger age, migraine without aura, parents' higher educational status, maternal use of CAM and other associated chronic conditions, correlated with CAM use (p < 0.05). 73 % patients chose CAM also to treat other diseases (i.e. allergies, colitis, asthma, insomnia, muscle-scheletric disorders and dysmenorrhoea). The most assumed CAM were: herbal remedies (64 %) such as Valeriana, Ginkgo biloba, Boswellia serrata, Vitex agnus-castus, passion flower, Linden tree; vitamins/minerals supplements (40 %) with magnesium, 5-Hydroxytryptophan, vitamin B6 or B12, Multivitamin compounds; Homeopathy (47 %) with Silicea, Ignatia Amara, Pulsatilla, Aconitum, Nux Vomica, Calcarea phosphorica; physical treatment (45 %) such as Ayurvedic massage, shiatsu, osteopathy; yoga (33 %); acupuncture (11 %). CAM-often integrated with conventional care-was auto-prescribed in 30 % of the cases, suggested by non-physician in 22 %, by the General Practitioner in 24 % and by paediatrician in 24 %. Both general practitioners and neurologists were mostly unaware of their patients' CAM use. In conclusion, neurologists should inquire for CAM use and be prepared to learn about CAM therapies or to directly interact with CAM trained experts, in order to coordinate an integrative approach to health, as especially required in paediatric headache patients and their parents. Further studies are required to investigate safety and efficacy of CAM in pediatric headache, as a possible side-medicine to conventional pharmacological approach.

24856936	Some physiotherapy treatments may relieve menstrual pain in women with primary dysmenorrhea: a systematic review.	QUESTION: In women with primary dysmenorrhoea, what is the effect of physiotherapeutic interventions compared to control (either no treatment or placebo/sham) on pain and quality of life? DESIGN: Systematic review of randomised trials with meta-analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Women with primary dysmenorrhea. INTERVENTION: Any form of physiotherapy treatment. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was menstrual pain intensity and the secondary outcome was quality of life. RESULTS: The search yielded 222 citations. Of these, 11 were eligible randomised trials and were included in the review. Meta-analysis revealed statistically significant reductions in pain severity on a 0-10 scale from acupuncture (weighted mean difference 2.3, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.9) and acupressure (weighted mean difference 1.4, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.9), when compared to a control group receiving no treatment. However, these are likely to be placebo effects because when the control groups in acupuncture/acupressure trials received a sham instead of no treatment, pain severity did not significantly differ between the groups. Significant reductions in pain intensity on a 0-10 scale were noted in individual trials of heat (by 1.8, 95% CI 0.9 to 2.7), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (2.3, 95% CI 0.03 to 4.2), and yoga (3.2, 95% CI 2.2 to 4.2). Meta-analysis of two trials of spinal manipulation showed no significant reduction in pain. None of the included studies measured quality of life. CONCLUSION: Physiotherapists could consider using heat, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and yoga in the management of primary dysmenorrhea. While benefits were also identified for acupuncture and acupressure in no-treatment controlled trials, the absence of significant effects in sham-controlled trials suggests these effects are mainly attributable to placebo effects.

24854543	The Living Well Lab: a community-based HIV/AIDS research initiative.	BACKGROUND: Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) is becoming a pillar in the rehabilitative efforts for many living with HIV/AIDS. A community-based research program called the Living Well Lab (LWL) was established in 2007, operating out of Friends For Life (FFL), a non-profit wellness center in Vancouver, Canada offering free CAM therapies to people living with HIV/AIDS. Therapies range from naturopathy to yoga. The LWL partnered with academic and community organizations to evaluate CAM use and changes in health and quality of life outcomes of FFL's HIV+ members. METHODS: A longitudinal, combined methods approach assessed the health- and quality-of-life-related outcomes and experiences of CAM users. Participants completed outcome packages (5 time points) over 18 months, which focused on changes in physical and emotional states, satisfaction with services and social support. Interviews were conducted at baseline, 9- and 18-month time points. Quantitative analyses were descriptive while content analysis and thematic coding were used in the qualitative analysis. RESULTS: Two hundred and seven members enrolled in the LWL. Quantitative data demonstrated improvement in mental and physical wellbeing, social support and patient satisfaction specifically: SF-12, Arizona Integrative Outcomes Scale and three visual analog scales (stress, pain and energy). Participants felt several factors contributed to these changes such as managing anxiety, accepting their illness, learning to relax, an increased capacity for self-care and social support. CONCLUSIONS: CAM use may be associated with changes to physical, social and mental wellbeing. Issues throughout the study provided important lessons for future research.

24852286	Prevalence of orthorexia nervosa among ashtanga yoga practitioners: a pilot study.	PURPOSE: Orthorexia nervosa (ON, i.e., fixation on righteous eating) is a poorly defined disordered eating behavior that results from a pathological obsession with food, its purported nutritional value, composition, origin, etc. METHODS: We investigated the prevalence of ON in a local ashtanga yoga community, by using a validated questionnaire (ORTO-15) that sets a threshold of ON diagnosis at </=40. RESULTS: Among the 136 respondents, the mean ORTO-15 score (which was normally distributed) was 35.27 +/- 3.69, i.e., 86 % of respondents had an ORTO-15 score lower than 40 and no significant association with age or BMI was recorded. When we analyzed the differential distribution of orthorexia in our cohort, we recorded an association of ORTO-15 score and vegetarianism, i.e., the ORTO-15 score was lower among vegetarians. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot study should suggest ashtanga yoga teachers to avoid excessive reference to a healthy diet, which is natural component of yoga practice.

24850815	Do workplace physical activity interventions improve mental health outcomes?	BACKGROUND: Mental health is an important issue in the working population. Interventions to improve mental health have included physical activity. AIMS: To review evidence for the effectiveness of workplace physical activity interventions on mental health outcomes. METHODS: A literature search was conducted for studies published between 1990 and August 2013. Inclusion criteria were physical activity trials, working populations and mental health outcomes. Study quality was assessed using the Jadad scale. RESULTS: Of 3684 unique articles identified, 17 met all selection criteria, including 13 randomized controlled trials, 2 comparison trials and 2 controlled trials. Studies were grouped into two key intervention areas: physical activity and yoga exercise. Of eight high-quality trials, two provided strong evidence for a reduction in anxiety, one reported moderate evidence for an improvement in depression symptoms and one provided limited evidence on relieving stress. The remaining trials did not provide evidence on improved mental well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Workplace physical activity and yoga programmes are associated with a significant reduction in depressive symptoms and anxiety, respectively. Their impact on stress relief is less conclusive.	Chu, A H Y;Koh, D;Moy, F M;Muller-Riemenschneider, F	2014 Jun
24835753	Comparative impacts of Tai Chi, balance training, and a specially-designed yoga program on balance in older fallers.	OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of a custom-designed yoga program with 2 other balance training programs. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: A group of older adults (N=39; mean age, 74.15 +/- 6.99 y) with a history of falling. INTERVENTIONS: Three different exercise interventions (Tai Chi, standard balance training, yoga) were given for 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Balance performance was examined during pre- and posttest using field tests, including the 8-foot up-and-go test, 1-leg stance, functional reach, and usual and maximal walking speed. The static and dynamic balances were also assessed by postural sway and dynamic posturography, respectively. RESULTS: Training produced significant improvements in all field tests (P<.005), but group difference and time x group interaction were not detected. For postural sway, significant decreases in the area of the center of pressure with eyes open (P=.001) and eyes closed (P=.002) were detected after training. For eyes open, maximum medial-lateral velocity significantly decreased for the sample (P=.013). For eyes closed, medial-lateral displacement decreased for Tai Chi (P<.01). For dynamic posturography, significant improvements in overall score (P=.001), time on the test (P=.006), and 2 linear measures in lateral (P=.001) and anterior-posterior (P<.001) directions were seen for the sample. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga was as effective as Tai Chi and standard balance training for improving postural stability and may offer an alternative to more traditional programs.

24834493	Effects of Yogic Practice on Metabolism and Antioxidant-Redox Status of Physically Active Males.	BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of yogic practice on resting metabolism and redox status. METHODS: The study was conducted on 64 physically trained male volunteers selected randomly at the Air Force Academy. The yoga group (n = 34) practiced yogasana, pranayama, and meditation for 3 months (February-May 2011) and the control group (n = 30) performed physical training. Antioxidant variables in blood samples along with physiological parameters were estimated before and after 3 months. RESULTS: No significant difference was noted between baseline data of the control group and yoga group. Reduced glutathione, vitamin C, and vitamin E; the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione; and total antioxidant status were increased significantly following yogic practice. Activities of superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase, and glutathione reductase were significantly increased, whereas activity of glutathione peroxidase was significantly decreased following yogic practice. Oxidized glutathione decreased significantly following yogic practice. A nonsignificant decrease of hydroperoxides, protein carbonyl, malondialdehyde, and blood sugar was noted in the yoga group. Carbon dioxide elimination and peripheral oxygen saturation increased significantly following yogic practice. No significant changes were observed in the control group following 3 months of physical training. CONCLUSIONS: Regular yogic practice can improve resting metabolism and redox status of the practitioner.

24833780	Timed-daily ingestion of whey protein and exercise training reduces visceral adipose tissue mass and improves insulin resistance: the PRISE study.	The present study examined the effects of timed ingestion of supplemental protein (20-g servings of whey protein, 3x/day), added to the habitual diet of free-living overweight/obese adults and subsequently randomized to either whey protein only (P; n = 24), whey protein and resistance exercise (P + RT; n = 27), or a whey protein and multimode exercise training program [protein and resistance exercise, intervals, stretching/yoga/Pilates, endurance exercise (PRISE); n = 28]. Total and regional body composition and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), insulin sensitivity [homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)], plasma lipids and adipokines, and feelings of hunger and satiety (visual analog scales) were measured before and after the 16-wk intervention. All groups lost body weight, fat mass (FM), and abdominal fat; however, PRISE lost significantly (P < 0.01) more body weight (3.3 +/- 0.7 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.7 kg, P + RT) and FM (2.8 +/- 0.7 vs. 0.9 +/- 0.5 kg, P + RT) and gained (P < 0.05) a greater percentage of lean body mass (2 +/- 0.5 vs. 0.9 +/- 0.3 and 0.6 +/- 0.4%, P + RT and P, respectively). Only P + RT (0.1 +/- 0.04 kg) and PRISE (0.21 +/- 0.07 kg) lost VAT mass (P < 0.05). Fasting glucose decreased only in P + RT (5.1 +/- 2.5 mg/dl) and PRISE (15.3 +/- 2.1 mg/dl), with the greatest decline occurring in PRISE (P < 0.05). Similarly, HOMA-IR improved (0.6 +/- 0.3, 0.6 +/- 0.4 units), and leptin decreased (4.7 +/- 2.2, 4.7 +/- 3.1 ng/dl), and adiponectin increased (3.8 +/- 1.1, 2.4 +/- 1.1 mug/ml) only in P + RT and PRISE, respectively, with no change in P. In conclusion, we find evidence to support exercise training and timed ingestion of whey protein added to the habitual diet of free-living overweight/obese adults, independent of caloric restriction on total and regional body fat distribution, insulin resistance, and adipokines.

24831396	Effects of yoga breathing exercises on pulmonary function in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy: an exploratory analysis.	OBJECTIVE: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common form of muscular dystrophy in children, and children with DMD die prematurely because of respiratory failure. We sought to determine the efficacy and safety of yoga breathing exercises, as well as the effects of those exercises on respiratory function, in such children. METHODS: This was a prospective open-label study of patients with a confirmed diagnosis of DMD, recruited from among those followed at the neurology outpatient clinic of a university hospital in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Participants were taught how to perform hatha yoga breathing exercises and were instructed to perform the exercises three times a day for 10 months. RESULTS: Of the 76 patients who entered the study, 35 dropped out and 15 were unable to perform the breathing exercises, 26 having therefore completed the study (mean age, 9.5 +/- 2.3 years; body mass index, 18.2 +/- 3.8 kg/m(2)). The yoga breathing exercises resulted in a significant increase in FVC (% of predicted: 82.3 +/- 18.6% at baseline vs. 90.3 +/- 22.5% at 10 months later; p = 0.02) and FEV1 (% of predicted: 83.8 +/- 16.6% at baseline vs. 90.1 +/- 17.4% at 10 months later; p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Yoga breathing exercises can improve pulmonary function in patients with DMD.

24829729	Preventive Effects of a Three-month Yoga Intervention on Endothelial Function in Patients with Migraine.	BACKGROUND: Migraine is a neurovascular disorder and any interventions improving endothelial function may contribute to its treatment and prevention of vascular complications like ischemic stroke. Yoga has been shown to have several beneficial effects on cardiovascular systems. However, no randomized controlled studies to date have investigated its effects on endothelial function of migraineurs. METHODS: A total of 42 women patients with migraine were enrolled and randomized into either a Yoga exercise group or a control group. The control group received only medication for 12 weeks and the Yoga group was placed in yoga training program in addition to the same medical treatment. Blood test was given from all patients in order to measure plasma levels intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) after yoga training program. RESULTS: Totally 32 patients were participated in the final analyses (yoga: n = 18, control: n = 14). By analyzing data between yoga and control groups after the treatment period, there was a significant decreased in plasma level of VCAM in yoga group compare with the control group (15.29 +/- 2.1 ng/ml vs. 21.70 +/- 3.0 ng/ml, P < 0.05), whereas there was no significant difference in ICAM level between groups (19.1 +/- 1.8 ng/ml vs. 20.97 +/- 1.9 ng/ml P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: It seems that yoga exercises, as a complementary treatment beside pharmacological treatments, can be potentially an effective way of improving vascular functions in migraineurs.

24825181	Yoga for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease.	BACKGROUND: A sedentary lifestyle and stress are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Since yoga involves exercise and is thought to help in stress reduction it may be an effective strategy in the primary prevention of CVD. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of any type of yoga on the primary prevention of CVD. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 11) in The Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to November Week 3 2013); EMBASE Classic + EMBASE (Ovid) (1947 to 2013 Week 48); Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) (1970 to 4 December 2013); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment Database and Health Economics Evaluations Database (Issue 4 of 4, 2013) in The Cochrane Library. We also searched a number of Asian databases and the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) (inception to December 2012). We searched trial registers and reference lists of reviews and articles, and approached experts in the field. We applied no language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials lasting at least three months involving healthy adults or those at high risk of CVD. Trials examined any type of yoga and the comparison group was no intervention or minimal intervention. Outcomes of interest were clinical CVD events and major CVD risk factors. We did not include any trials that involved multifactorial lifestyle interventions or weight loss. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 11 trials (800 participants) and two ongoing studies. Style and duration of yoga differed between trials. Half of the participants recruited to the studies were at high risk of CVD. Most of studies were at risk of performance bias, with inadequate details reported in many of them to judge the risk of selection bias.No study reported cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality or non-fatal events, and most studies were small and short-term. There was substantial heterogeneity between studies making it impossible to combine studies statistically for systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol. Yoga was found to produce reductions in diastolic blood pressure (mean difference (MD) -2.90 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.52 to -1.28), which was stable on sensitivity analysis, triglycerides (MD -0.27 mmol/l, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.11) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (MD 0.08 mmol/l, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.14). However, the contributing studies were small, short-term and at unclear or high risk of bias. There was no clear evidence of a difference between groups for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (MD -0.09 mmol/l, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.30), although there was moderate statistical heterogeneity. Adverse events, occurrence of type 2 diabetes and costs were not reported in any of the included studies. Quality of life was measured in three trials but the results were inconclusive. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The limited evidence comes from small, short-term, low-quality studies. There is some evidence that yoga has favourable effects on diastolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and uncertain effects on LDL cholesterol. These results should be considered as exploratory and interpreted with caution.	Hartley, Louise;Dyakova, Mariana;Holmes, Jennifer;Clarke, Aileen;Lee, Myeong Soo;Ernst, Edzard;Rees, Karen	2014 May 13
24824103	Exercise and yoga during pregnancy: a survey.	The primary objective of this survey was to ascertain the opinions, practices and knowledge about exercise, including yoga, during pregnancy; the secondary objective to compare the responses among women with body mass index (BMI) <30 kg/m(2) versus >/=30 kg/m(2). Survey consisted of 20 multiple choice questions assessing demographics and exercise practices, and five questions testing their knowledge about it during pregnancy (ACOG Committee Opinion # 267). Of the 500 surveys distributed, 84% (422) responses were analyzed. While 86% of women responded that exercise during pregnancy is beneficial, 83% felt it was beneficial to start prior to pregnancy, and walking was considered the most beneficial (62%). The majority (64%) of respondents were currently exercising during pregnancy and 51% exercised 2-3 times/week. Among the five questions testing knowledge about prenatal exercise, majority (range 60 to 92%) were aware of ACOG recommendations. About half had a BMI >/=30. Knowledge about benefits of exercise during pregnancy did not differ significantly between obese and non-obese. Yoga was tried significantly more among non-obese, 65% believed it is beneficial, and 40% had attempted yoga before pregnancy. In our population, the majority believes that exercise, including yoga, is beneficial and they are active.	Babbar, Shilpa;Chauhan, Suneet P	2015 Mar
24820613	[Yoga and the promotion of health].	The scope of this paper is to analyze the self-declared symptoms and state of well-being of participants in the "Yoga and Promotion of Health" program, which consisted of hatha yoga lessons. It includes body exercises and breathing techniques, as well as ethical and philosophical content, administered to two groups of lecturers, workers and students of a public university in the State of Sao Paulo from August to December 2011 and March to June 2012. The participants filled out the adapted version of the Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile form at the beginning and end of the program. Of the 20 participants in Group 1, eight filled out the form and half of them reported the improvement of self-declared symptoms; as regards the state of well being, three of them felt they had improved. In Group 2, which also had 20 participants, nine completed the program and all of them reported improvements of self-declared symptoms and well-being. In conclusion, yoga is a mind-body practice which exerts an important therapeutic effect on most practitioners and also promotes health for the majority of them, expanding their capacity of self perception and self care. However, it should be noted that it doesn't achieve the same positive effect for all practitioners as some yoga traditions advocate.	de Barros, Nelson Filice;Siegel, Pamela;de Moura, Soraia Maria;Cavalari, Thais Adriana;da Silva, Luis Geraldo;Furlanetti, Maria Renata;Goncalves, Andrea Vasconcelos	2014 Apr
24818341	Science of exercise: ancient Indian origin.	BACKGROUND: Many western literature on ancient exercise science were available. Unfortunately ancient Indian contribution in this area was ignored. AIM: The aim of this approach was to search ancient Indian literature on science of exercise. METHOD: The researcher reviewed thoroughly complete Caraka Samhita (nearly ten thousand prose and verse) and the outcome was first time reported in this paper. RESULT: More than one hundred and twenty slokes (aphorism) on exercise (vyayama) were discovered from Caraka Samhita. Oldest definition of exercise was found from Caraka Samhita, which was percolated from the world's oldest record of medicine practice. Caraka Samhita has been divided into eight section and it was observed that in each section vyayama (exercise) was specially referred whenever needed. The good effect, bad effect, contraindication and feature of correct exercise were mentioned in Caraka Samhita. The season and time of vyayama has also been mentioned. Caraka Samhita,also the world's oldest living evidence of exercise therapy literature prescribed twenty types of kaphaja (phlegm) diseases and many other diseases (obesity and diabetes etc.) can be cured or minimize the consequences through vyayama. According to Caraka Samhita, human is the combination of the body, mind and soul. This Samhita clearly suggested vyayama (exercise) for the body and yoga for mind and soul. CONCLUSION: From the ancient time India was familiar with the science of exercise and its beneficial effect. It was forgotten due to local ignorance and western influence. The contribution of Caraka Samhita and other ancient Indian literature on the science of exercise should be incorporated in all the appropriate places as early as possible.	Mondal, Samiran	2013 Aug

24813261	Physical activity interventions for people with mental illness: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVE: To determine effects of physical activity on depressive symptoms (primary objective), symptoms of schizophrenia, anthropometric measures, aerobic capacity, and quality of life (secondary objectives) in people with mental illness and explore between-study heterogeneity. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase, and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) were searched from earliest record to 2013. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials of adults with a DSM-IV-TR, ICD-10, or clinician-confirmed diagnosis of a mental illness other than dysthymia or eating disorders were selected. Interventions included exercise programs, exercise counseling, lifestyle interventions, tai chi, or physical yoga. Study methodological quality and intervention compliance with American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines were also assessed. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Two investigators extracted data. Data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Meta-regression was used to examine sources of between-study heterogeneity. RESULTS: Thirty-nine eligible trials were identified. The primary meta-analysis found a large effect of physical activity on depressive symptoms (n = 20; standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.80). The effect size in trial interventions that met ACSM guidelines for aerobic exercise did not differ significantly from those that did not meet these guidelines. The effect for trials with higher methodological quality was smaller than that observed for trials with lower methodological quality (SMD = 0.39 vs 1.35); however, the difference was not statistically significant. A large effect was found for schizophrenia symptoms (SMD = 1.0), a small effect was found for anthropometry (SMD = 0.24), and moderate effects were found for aerobic capacity (SMD = 0.63) and quality of life (SMD = 0.64). CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity reduced depressive symptoms in people with mental illness. Larger effects were seen in studies of poorer methodological quality. Physical activity reduced symptoms of schizophrenia and improved anthropometric measures, aerobic capacity, and quality of life among people with mental illness.

24804619	Yoga-enhanced cognitive behavioural therapy (Y-CBT) for anxiety management: a pilot study.	Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for generalized anxiety disorder, but there is still room for improvement. The aim of the present study was to examine the potential benefit of enriching CBT with kundalini yoga (Y-CBT). Participants consisted of treatment resistant clients at a community mental health clinic. A total of 32 participants enrolled in the study and 22 completed the programme. After the Y-CBT intervention, pre-post comparisons showed statistically significant improvements in state and trait anxiety, depression, panic, sleep and quality of life. Results from this preliminary study suggest that Y-CBT may have potential as a promising treatment for those suffering from generalized anxiety disorder. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGES: Yoga-enhanced cognitive behavioural therapy (Y-CBT) may be a promising new treatment for those suffering from generalized anxiety disorder. Y-CBT may also reduce depression in those suffering from generalized anxiety. Y-CBT may reduce depression and anxiety in a clinic population where clients suffer from multiple diagnoses including generalized anxiety disorder.

24803889	Online survey of patients with breast cancer on complementary and alternative medicine.	About 50% of cancer patients use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Women with breast cancer use CAM more frequently than others. We linked a questionnaire to the largest internet portal for cancer patients in Germany. The questionnaire addresses attitude towards CAM, disclosure to the oncologist, source of information, and objectives for use of CAM. 80 patients with breast cancer took part in our study, 61 currently using CAM. Most frequently used CAM methods were selenium, relaxation techniques, prayer, vitamin C, and meditation. Satisfaction was highest with relaxation techniques, vitamin C, homeopathy, yoga and Chinese herbs, lowest with mistletoe and acupuncture. 70% of participants did not think their oncologist took time to discuss CAM. Only 16% believed that their oncologist was well-informed about CAM. 46% relied on naturopaths and non-medical practitioners concerning CAM. Objectives for the use of CAM were to reduce side effects, boost the immune system, and become active.

24800258	Mental health status among married working women residing in Bhubaneswar city, India: a psychosocial survey.	Mental health is a major public health concern worldwide. This study aimed to assess the mental health status and its correlates among married working women residing in Bhubaneswar city of Odisha, India. A cross-sectional study was undertaken in 240 households involving 240 married working women following a multistage cluster random sampling design. Using the predesigned, pretested interview schedule and self-reporting questionnaire, all relevant information was collected. Our study revealed that 32.9% of study respondents had poor mental health and only about 10% of these women had sought any kind of mental health services. Logistic regression analysis showed that 3 predictors such as favourable attitude of colleagues, sharing their own problems with husband, and spending time for yoga/meditation/exercise had significant positive impact on the mental health status of married working women. A preventive program regarding various aspects of mental health for married working women at workplace as well as community level could be a useful strategy in reducing this public health problem.

24800042	Level of attitude toward complementary and alternative medicine among Iranian patients with multiple sclerosis.	BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an unpredictable neurological disease leading to severe disability in young adults. The majority of MS patients use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as adjunct to conventional therapies. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of CAM utilization among Iranian patients with MS and their attitude toward the CAM usage. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 119 definite MS patients referred to Tehran's Imam Khomeini and Sina hospitals. A questionnaire was used to examine the association between participants' health-related factors and usage of CAMs interventions. P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Among the enrolled patients, 60% of the participants agreed with using CAM, 42% experienced the usage of these treatments; out of whom 41% believed its efficiency and 18% reported exacerbation of symptoms. The mean duration of disease diagnosis and mean time from symptoms onset were both longer in users of CAM (P = 0.001). Most socio-demographic factors had no significant effect on the type of used CAM. However, Yoga was significantly more applied in those with higher degree of education (P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Regarding the widespread use of CAM by Iranian patients with MS, further researches about the safety and efficacy of each treatment on the special outcomes is recommended.

24799497	Psychological and behavioral approaches to cancer pain management.	This review examines evidence for psychological factors that affect pain across the cancer continuum from diagnosis through treatment and long-term survivorship or end of life. Evidence is convincing that emotional distress, depression, anxiety, uncertainty, and hopelessness interact with pain. Unrelieved pain can increase a desire for hastened death. Patients with cancer use many strategies to manage pain, with catastrophizing associated with increased pain and self-efficacy associated with lower pain reports. A variety of psychological and cognitive behavioral treatments can reduce pain severity and interference with function, as indicated in multiple meta-analyses and high-quality randomized controlled trials. Effective methods include education (with coping skills training), hypnosis, cognitive behavioral approaches, and relaxation with imagery. Exercise has been tested extensively in patients with cancer and long-term survivors, but few exercise studies have evaluated pain outcomes. In survivors post-treatment, yoga and hypnosis as well as exercise show promise for controlling pain. Although some of these treatments effectively reduce pain for patients with advanced disease, few have been tested in patients at the end of life. Given the clear indicators that psychological factors affect cancer pain and that psychological and behavioral treatments are effective in reducing varying types of pain for patients with active disease, these methods need further testing in cancer survivors post-treatment and in patients with end-stage disease. Multidisciplinary teams are essential in oncology settings to integrate analgesic care and expertise in psychological and behavioral interventions in standard care for symptom management, including pain.

24795629	Fluid intelligence and brain functional organization in aging yoga and meditation practitioners.	Numerous studies have documented the normal age-related decline of neural structure, function, and cognitive performance. Preliminary evidence suggests that meditation may reduce decline in specific cognitive domains and in brain structure. Here we extended this research by investigating the relation between age and fluid intelligence and resting state brain functional network architecture using graph theory, in middle-aged yoga and meditation practitioners, and matched controls. Fluid intelligence declined slower in yoga practitioners and meditators combined than in controls. Resting state functional networks of yoga practitioners and meditators combined were more integrated and more resilient to damage than those of controls. Furthermore, mindfulness was positively correlated with fluid intelligence, resilience, and global network efficiency. These findings reveal the possibility to increase resilience and to slow the decline of fluid intelligence and brain functional architecture and suggest that mindfulness plays a mechanistic role in this preservation.

24795403	A systematic review and meta-analysis of yoga for hypertension.	BACKGROUND: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendation for yoga as a therapeutic means in the management of prehypertension and hypertension. METHODS: MEDLINE/Pubmed, Scopus, CENTRAL, and IndMED were screened through February 2014 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of yoga interventions (>/=8 weeks) compared with usual care or any active control intervention on blood pressure in patients with prehypertension (120-139/80-89 mm Hg) or hypertension (>/=140/>/=90 mm Hg). Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool; quality of evidence was assessed according to the GRADE recommendations. RESULTS: Seven RCTs with a total of 452 patients were included. Compared with usual care, very low-quality evidence was found for effects of yoga on systolic (6 RCTs, n = 278; mean difference (MD) = -9.65 mm Hg, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -17.23 to -2.06, P = 0.01; heterogeneity: I (2) = 90%, chi(2) = 48.21, P < 0.01) and diastolic blood pressure (6 RCTs, n = 278; MD = -7.22 mm Hg, 95% CI = -12.83 to -1.62, P = 0.01; heterogeneity: I (2) = 92%, chi(2) = 64.84, P < 0.01). Subgroup analyses revealed effects for RCTs that included hypertensive patients but not for RCTs that included both hypertensive and prehypertensive patients, as well as for RCTs that allowed antihypertensive comedication but not for those that did not. More adverse events occurred during yoga than during usual care. Compared with exercise, no evidence was found for effects of yoga on systolic or diastolic blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Larger studies are required to confirm the emerging but low-quality evidence that yoga may be a useful adjunct intervention in the management of hypertension.

BACKGROUND: Due to the limited availability of data related to anemia in hospitalized children, this research was conducted to study the occurrence, morphological patterns, distribution in different age groups, sex, and severity of anemia among children aged 6 months-12 years. SETTING: Inpatients in department of pediatrics at a multispecialty hospital, Bangalore. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive cross sectional study from Oct, 2011 to Sep, 2012. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethical clearance was obtained from the ethical committee of the hospital as per 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. Unrestricted random sampling method was used to select the study group consisting of 882 children between the age of 6 months and 12 years. After obtaining the consent, data were obtained and statistically analyzed using statistical tools like mean, median, standard deviation, and Chi-square test. RESULTS: Out of 882 children selected, 642 (72.79%) were anemic, out of which a majority of 629 (98%) children suffered from nonhemoglobinopathies and a meagre 13 (2%) suffered from hemoglobinopathies. Children in the age group of 6 months-1 year were most affected with nonhemoglobinopathies (33%). Moderate degree of anemia (hemoglobin = 7-9.9 g/dL) was the commonest grade of anemia (80%), while microcytic hypochromic anemia was commonest morphological type of anemia (48%). Among hemoglobinopathies, thalassemia major was the most common (69%, that is 9 out of 13 patients). CONCLUSION: The occurrence of anemia among children aged between 6 months and 12 years is high and nonhemoglobinopathies predominate over the hemoglobinopathies.

24788589	Effects of antenatal yoga on maternal anxiety and depression: a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Antenatal depression and anxiety are associated with adverse obstetric and mental health outcomes, yet practicable nonpharmacological therapies, particularly for the latter, are lacking. Yoga incorporates relaxation and breathing techniques with postures that can be customized for pregnant women. This study tested the efficacy of yoga as an intervention for reducing maternal anxiety during pregnancy. METHODS: Fifty-nine primiparous, low-risk pregnant women completed questionnaires assessing state (State Trait Anxiety Inventory; STAI-State), trait (STAI-Trait), and pregnancy-specific anxiety (Wijma Delivery Expectancy Questionnaire; WDEQ) and depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; EPDS) before randomization (baseline) to either an 8-week course of antenatal yoga or treatment-as-usual (TAU); both groups repeated the questionnaires at follow-up. The yoga group also completed pre- and postsession state anxiety and stress hormone assessments at both the first and last session of the 8-week course. RESULTS: A single session of yoga reduced both subjective and physiological measures of state anxiety (STAI-S and cortisol); and this class-induced reduction in anxiety remained at the final session of the intervention. Multiple linear regression analyses identified allocation to yoga as predictive of greater reduction in WDEQ scores (B = -9.59; BCa 95% CI = -18.25 to -0.43; P = .014; d = -0.57), while allocation to TAU was predictive of significantly increased elevation in EPDS scores (B = -3.06; BCa 95% CI = -5.9 to -0.17; P = .042; d = -0.5). No significant differences were observed in state or trait anxiety scores between baseline and follow-up. CONCLUSION: Antenatal yoga seems to be useful for reducing women's anxieties toward childbirth and preventing increases in depressive symptomatology.

24782738	Movement-based embodied contemplative practices: definitions and paradigms.	Over the past decades, cognitive neuroscience has witnessed a shift from predominantly disembodied and computational views of the mind, to more embodied and situated views of the mind. These postulate that mental functions cannot be fully understood without reference to the physical body and the environment in which they are experienced. Within the field of contemplative science, the directing of attention to bodily sensations has so far mainly been studied in the context of seated meditation and mindfulness practices. However, the cultivation of interoceptive, proprioceptive and kinesthetic awareness is also said to lie at the core of many movement-based contemplative practices such as Yoga, Qigong, and Tai Chi. In addition, it likely plays a key role in the efficacy of modern somatic therapeutic techniques such as the Feldenkrais Method and the Alexander Technique. In the current paper we examine how these practices are grounded in the concepts of embodiment, movement and contemplation, as we look at them primarily through the lens of an enactive approach to cognition. Throughout, we point to a series of challenges that arise when Western scientists study practices that are based on a non-dualistic view of mind and body.

26997809	Complementary and Alternate Management of Glaucoma: The Verdict so Far.	Complementary and alternative medicine deserves scientific scrutiny as patients with glaucoma often lose vision despite adequate medical or surgical treatment. Most glaucomatologists abstain from recommending alternative medicine as there is little evidence to support most of the recommendations for complementary and alternate management (CAM) use in glaucoma. Megavitamin supplementation has not been shown to have a long-term beneficial effect on glaucoma. In a glaucomatous eye, a very modest benefit of IOP-lowering may be offset by the temporary elevation in IOP that accompanies exercise. There is little evidence to support the use of special diets, acupuncture, relaxation techniques, or therapeutic touch for the treatment of glaucoma. Marijuana can have a profound lowering of IOP, but the low response rate, short half-life, and significant toxicity are strong indicators that it is not an appropriate therapeutic agent. Future research must be carried out to document the effect of CAM not only on IOP, but also on perimetric tests or other objective parameters, such as ocular blood fow and nerve fiber layer thickness.

24774033	Spirituality in the context of life-threatening illness and life-transforming change.	OBJECTIVE: Individuals with life-threatening illness often engage in some form of spirituality to meet increased needs for meaning and purpose. This study aimed to identify the role of spirituality in persons who had reported positive, life-transforming change in relation to life-threatening cancer or cardiac events, and to connect these roles to palliative and supportive care. METHOD: A purposive sample of 10 cardiac survivors and 9 cancer survivors was recruited. Once the participants had given informed consent and passed screening in relation to life-transforming change and distress, they engaged in a semistructured one-hour qualitative interview on the theme of how their life-transforming change occurred in the context of their life-threatening illness. In the present article, our phenomenological analysis focuses on participants' references to purpose and meaning in their lives, with particular attention to the role and context of participants' spirituality. RESULTS: Participants mentioned spirituality, meaning, and purpose in many contexts, including connecting with family and friends, nature, art, music, and sometimes creating a relationship with God. Participants often accessed spirituality by enhancing connections in their own lives: with a higher power, people, their work, or themselves. These enhanced connections gave participants greater meaning and purpose in their lives, and substantially helped participants to adjust to their life-threatening illnesses. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Understanding the roles and contexts of spirituality among patients with a life-threatening illness allows us to develop better palliative and supportive care plans. Spiritually oriented supportive care may include support groups, yoga, meditation, nature, music, prayer, or referral to spiritual or religious counselors. A quantitative scale is needed to help healthcare clinicians assess the spiritual and coping needs of individuals with life-threatening illness.

24771916	Yoga for Patients with Early Breast Cancer and its Impact on Quality of Life - a Randomized Controlled Trial.	The aim of this prospective, randomized, controlled trial was to investigate the impact of yoga on newly diagnosed patients with early breast cancer in the immediate postoperative phase. 93 women newly diagnosed with early breast cancer were randomized into an intervention group (IG) and a control group (waiting group, WG). The IG started yoga immediately after the operation. The WG started yoga 5 weeks after surgery. Both groups attended yoga classes twice weekly for 5 weeks. Quality of life (QoL) was evaluated using the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23 questionnaires before the intervention, immediately after the operation and after 3 months. After 3 months the patients were asked whether yoga improved their physical activity and whether they wished to continue with yoga. The overall QoL (p = 0.002) and the functional status (p = 0.005) increased significantly in the IG, while physical symptoms decreased over time in both groups. 86 % of patients in the IG and only 59 % of patients in the WG (p = 0.04) confirmed a positive change in their physical activity through yoga. More women in the IG intended to continue with yoga (p = 0.03). Early initiation of yoga as a supportive treatment in cancer had a positive impact on QoL. Teaching yoga allowed patients to practice yoga by themselves, enhanced the patients' QoL and was found to improve physical activity.

24769590	The impact of yoga on quality of life and psychological distress in caregivers for patients with cancer.	PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of a six-week Vinyasa yoga (VY) intervention on caregivers' overall quality of life (QOL) and psychological distress. DESIGN: A single-group, pre- and post-test pilot study. SETTING: University public recreational facility. SAMPLE: 12 informal caregivers for patients with cancer. METHODS: Caregivers participated in a six-week VY intervention and completed measures of QOL and psychological distress pre- and postintervention. Program satisfaction was measured with open-ended survey questions. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: QOL, psychological distress, and program satisfaction. FINDINGS: Significant improvements were found in the mental component score of overall QOL and in overall psychological distress. Several subdomains of QOL and psychological distress were also improved significantly. Open-ended survey question responses revealed participants perceived physical and mental benefit from the intervention, highlighting improvements in flexibility, core and upper-body strength, balance, breathing, and energy. CONCLUSIONS: Informal caregivers may benefit mentally and physically from participating in VY. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Caregivers of patients with cancer characterize a group worthy of attention, research, and interventions focusing on their healthcare needs.

24769434	Heart rate variability and treatment outcome in major depression: a pilot study.	Variations in heart rate variability (HRV) have been associated with major depressive disorder (MDD), but the relationship of baseline HRV to treatment outcome in MDD is unclear. We conducted a pilot study to examine associations between resting baseline HRV and MDD treatment outcome. We retrospectively tested several parameters of HRV in an MDD treatment study with escitalopram (ESC, N=26) to generate a model of how baseline HRV related to treatment outcome, and cross-validated the model in a separate trial of MDD treatment with Iyengar yoga (IY, N=16). Lower relative power of very low frequency (rVLF) HRV at baseline predicted improvement in depressive symptoms when adjusted for age and gender (R2>.43 and p<0.05 for both trials). Although vagal parasympathetic measures were correlated with antidepressant treatment outcome, their predictive power was not significant after adjusting for age and gender. In conclusion, baseline resting rVLF was associated with depression treatment outcome in two independent MDD treatment studies. These results should be interpreted with caution due to limited sample size, but a strength of this study is its validation of the rVLF predictor in an independent sample. rVLF merits prospective confirmation as a candidate biomarker.

24767955	The effect of prenatal Hatha yoga on affect, cortisol and depressive symptoms.	Perinatal depression impacts maternal and child health, and little is known about effective interventions. The effects of prenatal Hatha yoga on cortisol, affect and depressive symptoms were investigated in 51 women. Twice during pregnancy, yoga group participants reported on affect and provided a saliva sample before and after a 90-min prenatal Hatha yoga session. Corresponding measures were obtained from yoga and control group participants on days of usual activity. Depressive symptoms were assessed in pregnancy and post partum. Cortisol was lower (p < .01) and positive affect higher (p < .001) on yoga compared to usual activity days. Negative affect and contentment (p < .05) improved more in response to the yoga session. Yoga group participants showed fewer postpartum (p < .05) but not antepartum depressive symptoms than control group participants. Findings indicate that prenatal Hatha yoga may improve current mood and may be effective in reducing postpartum depressive symptoms.

24765541	Yoga and Physical Rehabilitation Medicine: A Research Partnership in Integrative Care.	Mind-body interventions, such as yoga, that teach stress management with physical activity may be well suited for investigation in both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. In order to be considered as viable care options integrative studies need to offer a comprehensive design and include clinicians familiar with the disease process of the study populations. A review of the literature reveals a dearth of information related to the collaboration between yoga and physical rehabilitation medicine. This article discusses the collaboration with physical rehabilitation medicine to collect relevant pre- and post-intervention measures for an on-going pilot acceptability/feasibility yoga study for minority patients with osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. An interdisciplinary clinical research team selected psychosocial and physical measures for a community sample of bilingual minority patients, not typically identified as practicing yoga. Sixteen female adults aged 40-63 years (mean =51) completed baseline physical assessments using single leg stance, functional reach test, time up and go test, timed up from the floor test and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand measures. Baseline values show an average level of functional ability prior to beginning the intervention. Preliminary results indicate some improvement; however, selected measures may not have the sensitivity and specificity needed to identify significant change. In this study, combining interdisciplinary perspectives enhanced the quality of the research study design. The experience of this interdisciplinary clinical research team opens the discussion for future collaborations.	Middleton, Kr;Acevedo, At;Dietz, L;Brandon, Z;Andrade, R;Wallen, Gr	2013 Dec 7
24765080	Yoga for Children and Young People's Mental Health and Well-Being: Research Review and Reflections on the Mental Health Potentials of Yoga.	This article discusses yoga as a potential tool for children to deal with stress and regulate themselves. Yoga provides training of mind and body to bring emotional balance. We argue that children and young people need such tools to listen inward to their bodies, feelings, and ideas. Yoga may assist them in developing in sound ways, to strengthen themselves, and be contributing social beings. First, we address how children and young people in today's world face numerous expectations and constant stimulation through the Internet and other media and communication technologies. One reason why children experience stress and mental health challenges is that globalization exposes the youth all over the world to various new demands, standards, and options. There is also increased pressure to succeed in school, partly due to increased competition but also a diverse range of options available for young people in contemporary times than in the past. Our argument also partially rests on the fact that modern society offers plenty of distractions and unwelcome attractions, especially linked to new media technologies. The dominant presence of multimedia devices and the time spent on them by children are clear indicators of the shift in lifestyles and priorities of our new generation. While these media technologies are valuable resources in children and young people's lives for communication, learning, and entertainment, they also result in constant competition for youngster's attention. A main concept in our article is that yoga may help children and young people cope with stress and thus, contribute positively to balance in life, well-being, and mental health. We present research literature suggesting that yoga improves children's physical and mental well-being. Similarly, yoga in schools helps students improve resilience, mood, and self-regulation skills pertaining to emotions and stress.	Hagen, Ingunn;Nayar, Usha S	2014
24764631	The Effects of VR-based Wii Fit Yoga on Physical Function in Middle-aged Female LBP Patients.	[Purpose] The purpose of this research was to determine the effects of a virtual reality-based yoga program on middle-aged female low back pain patients. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty middle-aged female patients who suffered from low back pain were assigned to either a physical therapy program or a virtual reality-based yoga program for a period of four weeks. Participants could check their posture and weight bearing on a monitor as they shifted their weight or changed their postures on a Wii balance board. There were a total of seven exercise programs. A 30-minute, three times per week, virtual reality-based Wii Fit yoga program or trunk stabilizing exercise was performed, respectively. [Results] Repeated-measures analysis of covariance revealed significant differences in between pre- and post-training VAS, algometer, Oswestry low-back pain disability index (ODI), Roland Morris disability questionnaire (RMDQ), and fear avoidance beliefs questionnaire (FBQ) scores. The VAS, algometer, ODI, RMDQ, and FBQ scores showed significant differences in groups. Regarding the effect of time-by-group interaction, there were significant differences in VAS, ODI, ODI, and FBQ scores. [Conclusion] In conclusion, for middle-aged female patients who have low back pain, a virtual reality-based yoga program was shown to have positive effects on physical improvements, and this program can be employed as a therapeutic medium for prevention and cure of low back pain.

24763156	A group-based yoga therapy intervention for urinary incontinence in women: a pilot randomized trial.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of a group-based yoga therapy intervention for middle-aged and older women with urinary incontinence. METHODS: We conducted a pilot randomized trial of ambulatory women aged 40 years and older with stress, urgency, or mixed-type incontinence. Women were randomized to a 6-week yoga therapy program (n = 10) consisting of twice weekly group classes and once weekly home practice or a wait-list control group (n = 9). All participants also received written pamphlets about standard behavioral self-management strategies for incontinence. Changes in incontinence were assessed with 7-day voiding diaries. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age was 61.4 (8.2) years, and the mean baseline frequency of incontinence was 2.5 (1.3) episodes/d. After 6 weeks, the total incontinence frequency decreased by 70% (1.8 [0.9] fewer episodes/d) in the yoga therapy versus 13% (0.3 [1.7] fewer episodes/d) in the control group (P = 0.049). Participants in the yoga therapy group also reported an average of 71% decrease in stress incontinence frequency (0.7 [0.8] fewer episodes/d) compared with a 25% increase in controls (0.2 [1.1] more episodes/d) (P = 0.039). No significant differences in reduction in urgency incontinence were detected between the yoga therapy versus control groups (1.0 [1.0] versus 0.5 [0.5] fewer episodes/d; P = 0.20). All women starting the yoga therapy program completed at least 90% of the group classes and practice sessions. Two participants in each group reported adverse events unrelated to the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide preliminary evidence to support the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of a group-based yoga therapy intervention to improve urinary incontinence in women.

24763155	Comparison of mindfulness-based stress reduction versus yoga on urinary urge incontinence: a randomized pilot study. with 6-month and 1-year follow-up visits.	OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to compare the effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) versus yoga on urinary urge incontinence (UI) at 8 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year after beginning an 8-week program. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants in this prospective randomized single-masked pilot study were women aged 18 years or older with urge-predominant incontinence, 5 or more UI episodes (UIEs) on a 3-day voiding diary, and no recent anticholinergic use. Women were randomized to MBSR or yoga. The primary outcome was the percent change of UIE. RESULTS: Of 30 enrollees (15 in MBSR, 15 in yoga), 24 completed at least 5 of 8 sessions (13 in MBSR and 11 in yoga). Twenty and 21 women completed the 6-month and 12-month follow-up visits, respectively. At 8 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months, the median percent change from the baseline in UIE on the intention-to-treat analysis was greater for the MBSR group (-55.6, -71.4, and -66.7, respectively) compared with that for the yoga group (-33.3, -11.8, and -16.7, respectively), with P values ranging from 0.01 to 0.08. On intention-to-treat analysis, the median percent change in the Overactive Bladder Symptom and Quality of Life-Short Form and the Health-Related Quality of Life was greater at each time point for MBSR than for yoga but was statistically significant only at 8 weeks (P = 0.003 and 0.02, respectively). As per protocol analysis, at 8 weeks, 6/13 and 0/11 women in MBSR and yoga, respectively, reported they were very much or much better (P = 0.02), whereas at 1 year, 6/12 and 1/9 women in MBSR and yoga, respectively, did so (P = 0.16). DISCUSSION: These results support larger scale trials to evaluate MBSR, which seems to be a promising treatment of UI.	Baker, Jan;Costa, Donna;Guarino, Julie M;Nygaard, Ingrid	2014 May-Jun
24760476	Mechanisms for alternative treatments in Parkinson's disease: acupuncture, tai chi, and other treatments.	At least 40% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) use one or more forms of alternative therapy (AT) to complement standard treatments. This article reviews the commonest forms of AT for PD, including acupuncture, tai chi, yoga, mindfulness, massage, herbal medicine, and cannabis. We discuss the current evidence for the clinical efficacy of each AT and discuss potential mechanisms, including those suggested by animal and human studies. With a few notable exceptions, none of the treatments examined were investigated rigorously enough to draw definitive conclusions about efficacy or mechanism. Tai chi, acupuncture, Mucuna pruriens, cannabinoids, and music therapy have all been proposed to work through specific mechanisms, although current evidence is insufficient to support or refute these claims, with the possible exception of Mucuna pruriens (which contains levodopa). It is likely that most ATs predominantly treat PD patients through general mechanisms, including placebo effects, stress reduction, and improved mood and sleep, and AT may provide patients with a greater locus of control regarding their illness.

24755569	Yoga for improving sleep quality and quality of life for older adults.	CONTEXT: The aging process is associated with physiological changes that affect sleep. In older adults, undiagnosed and untreated insomnia may cause impaired daily function and reduced quality of life (QoL). Insomnia is also a risk factor for accidents and falls that are the main cause of accidental deaths in older adults and, therefore, is associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates in older populations. OBJECTIVES: The research team aimed to (1) examine the efficacy of a yoga intervention (YI) for the treatment of insomnia in older adults, (2) determine the ability of yoga to enhance the QoL of older adults, and (3) establish the applicability of yoga practice for older people in a Western cultural setting. DESIGN: A waiting-list controlled trial. Settings * The study took place in Jerusalem, Israel, from 2008-2009. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were older men and women (age >/= 60 y) with insomnia. INTERVENTION: The YI group participated in 12 wk of classes, held 2 x/wk, incorporating yoga postures, meditative yoga, and daily home practice of meditative yoga. OUTCOME MEASURES: The study used self-report assessments of sleep quality using the following: (1) sleep quality-the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and daily sleep and practice logs; (2) mood states-the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale long form (DASS-42) and the Profile of Mood States short form (POMS-SF); (3) a health survey (SF-36); and (4) mobile at-home sleep studies. RESULTS: Compared with controls, the YI group showed significant improvements in a range of subjective factors, including overall sleep quality; sleep efficiency; sleep latency and duration; self-assessed sleep quality; fatigue; general well-being; depression; anxiety; stress; tension; anger; vitality; and function in physical, emotional, and social roles. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga was shown to be safe and improved sleep and QoL in a group of older adults with insomnia. Outcomes depended on practice compliance.

24753993	A Pilot Feasibility Study of Whole-systems Ayurvedic Medicine and Yoga Therapy for Weight Loss.	OBJECTIVE: To develop and test the feasibility of a whole-systems lifestyle intervention for obesity treatment based on the practices of Ayurvedic medicine/ Yoga therapy. DESIGN: A pre-post weight loss intervention pilot study using conventional and Ayurvedic diagnosis inclusion criteria, tailored treatment within a standardized treatment algorithm, and standardized data collection instruments for collecting Ayurvedic outcomes. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of overweight/obese adult community members from Tucson, Arizona interested in a "holistic weight loss program" and meeting predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. INTERVENTION: A comprehensive diet, activity, and lifestyle modification program based on principles of Ayurvedic medicine/yoga therapy with significant self-monitoring of lifestyle behaviors. The 3-month program was designed to change eating and activity patterns and to improve self-efficacy, quality of life, well-being, vitality, and self-awareness around food choices, stress management, and barriers to weight loss. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in body weight, body mass index; body fat percentage, fat/lean mass, waist/hip circumference and ratio, and blood pressure. SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Diet and exercise self-efficacy scales; perceived stress scale; visual analog scales (VAS) of energy, appetite, stress, quality of life, well-being, and program satisfaction at all time points. RESULTS: Twenty-two adults attended an in-person Ayurvedic screening; 17 initiated the intervention, and 12 completed the 3-month intervention. Twelve completed follow-up at 6 months and 11 completed follow-up at 9 months. Mean weight loss at 3 months was 3.54 kg (SD 4.76); 6 months: 4.63 kg, (SD 6.23) and 9 months: 5.9 kg (SD 8.52). Self-report of program satisfaction was more than 90% at all time points. CONCLUSIONS: An Ayurveda-/yoga-based lifestyle modification program is an acceptable and feasible approach to weight management. Data collection, including self-monitoring and conventional and Ayurvedic outcomes, did not unduly burden participants, with attrition similar to that of other weight loss studies.

24753990	Pathways to Healing: Person-centered Responses to Complementary Services.	OBJECTIVES: This research study assessed perceived changes in quality-of-life measures related to participation in complementary services consisting of a variety of nontraditional therapies and/or programs at Pathways: A Health Crisis Resource Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota. DESIGN: Survey data were used to assess perceived changes participants ascribed to their experience with complementary services at Pathways. Quantitative data analysis was conducted using participant demographics together with participant ratings of items from the "Self-Assessment of Change" (SAC) measure developed at the University of Arizona, Tucson. Qualitative data analysis was conducted on written responses to an additional survey question: "To what extent has your participation at Pathways influenced your healing process?" SETTING/LOCATION: Pathways offers a variety of services, including one-to-one sessions using nontraditional healing therapies, support groups, educational classes, and practice groups such as yoga and meditation for those facing serious health challenges. These services are offered free of charge through community financial support using volunteer practitioners. PARTICIPANTS: People (126) diagnosed with serious health challenges who used Pathways services from 2007 through 2009. INTERVENTIONS: Participation in self-selected Pathways services. MEASURES: Responses to items on the SAC measure plus written responses to the question, "To what extent has your participation at Pathways influenced your healing process?" RESULTS: QUANTITATIVE FINDINGS: Participants reported experiencing significant changes across all components of the SAC measure. Qualitative findings: Responses to the open-ended survey question identified perspectives on the culture of Pathways and a shift in participants' perceptions of well-being based on their experience of Pathways services. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in services provided by the Pathways organization improved perceptions of quality of life and well-being and led to more active involvement in the experience of a healing process.

24750666	Regional variation in use of complementary health approaches by U.S. adults.	KEY FINDINGS: Data from the National Health Interview Survey, 2012 Use of nonvitamin, nonmineral dietary supplements (17.9%) was greater than any other complementary health approach used by U.S. adults in 2012. The use of practitioner-based chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation was nearly twice as high in the West North Central region as in the United States overall. Use of nonvitamin, nonmineral dietary supplements was highest in the Mountain, Pacific, and West North Central regions. Use of yoga with deep breathing or meditation was approximately 40% higher in the Pacific and Mountain regions than in the United States overall. Complementary health approaches are defined as "a group of diverse medical and health care interventions, practices, products, or disciplines that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine". They range from practitioner-based approaches, such as chiropractic manipulation and massage therapy, to predominantly self-care approaches, such as nonvitamin, nonmineral dietary supplements, meditation, and yoga. This report presents estimates of the four most commonly used complementary health approaches among adults aged 18 and over in nine geographic regions, using data from the 2012 National Health Interview Survey adult alternative medicine supplement.

24743466	Effect of exercise on cancer-related fatigue: a meta-analysis.	Numerous randomized controlled trials have been conducted to determine efficacy of exercise on cancer-related fatigue. However, many trials lacked sufficient power to demonstrate significant differences, and little is known about how the effect of exercise differs depending on patient- and intervention-level characteristics. A meta-analysis was performed to determine whether exercise reduces fatigue compared with usual care or nonexercise control intervention in patients with cancer. The authors searched Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINAHL. Two authors independently extracted the data. Randomized controlled trials comparing exercise with control intervention in cancer patients in which fatigue was quantified were eligible. Seventy-two randomized controlled trials were identified, 71 in adults and 1 in children. Exercise had a moderate effect on reducing fatigue compared with control intervention. Exercise also improved depression and sleep disturbance. Type of exercise did not significantly influence the effect on fatigue, depression, or sleep disturbance. Exercise effect was larger in the studies published 2009 or later. There was only one pediatric study. The results of this study suggest that exercise is effective for the management of cancer-related fatigue.	Tomlinson, Deborah;Diorio, Caroline;Beyene, Joseph;Sung, Lillian	2014 Aug
24742636	Relationship between complementary and alternative medicine use and incidence of adverse birth outcomes: an examination of a nationally representative sample of 1835 Australian women.	OBJECTIVE: there is evidence of high use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by pregnant women. Despite debate and controversy regarding CAM use in pregnancy there has been little research focus upon the impacts of CAM use on birth outcomes. This paper reports findings outlining the incidence of adverse birth outcomes among women accessing CAM during pregnancy. DESIGN: a survey-based cohort sub-study from the nationally-representative Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH) was undertaken in 2010. PARTICIPANTS: women (aged 31-36 years) who identified in 2009 as pregnant or recently given birth (n=2445) from the younger cohort (n=8012) of ALSWH were recruited for the study. MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: participants' responses were analysed to examine the relationship between use of CAM and adverse birth outcomes from their most recent pregnancy. Of the respondents (n=1835; 79.2%), there were variations in birth outcomes for the women who used different CAM. Notably, the outcome which was most commonly associated with CAM use was emotional distress. This was found to occur more commonly in women who practised meditation/yoga at home, used flower essences, or consulted with a chiropractor. In contrast, women who consulted with a chiropractor or consumed herbal teas were less likely to report a premature birth, whilst participation in yoga classes was associated with an increased incidence of post partum/intrapartum haemorrhage. KEY CONCLUSIONS: the results emphasise the necessity for further research evaluating the safety and effectiveness of CAM for pregnant women, with a particular focus on birth outcomes. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: health professionals providing care need to be aware of the potential birth outcomes associated with CAM use during pregnancy to enable the provision of accurate information to women in their care, and to assist in safely supporting women accessing CAM to assist with pregnancy, labour and birth.

24737932	A Randomized Controlled Trial to Study the Effect of Yoga Therapy on Cardiac Function and N Terminal Pro BNP in Heart Failure.	AIMS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether yoga training in addition to standard medical therapy can improve cardiac function and reduce N terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT pro BNP) in heart failure (HF). METHODS: 130 patients were recruited and randomized into two groups: Control Group (CG) (n = 65), Yoga Group (YG). In YG, 44 patients and in CG, 48 patients completed the study. Cardiac function using left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), myocardial performance index (Tei index), and NT pro BNP, a biomarker of HF, was assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks. RESULT: Improvement in LVEF, Tei index, and NT pro BNP were statistically significant in both the groups. Furthermore, when the changes in before and after 12 weeks were in percentage, LVEF increased 36.88% in the YG and 16.9% in the CG, Tei index was reduced 27.87% in the YG and 2.79% in the CG, NT pro BNP was reduced 63.75% in the YG and 10.77% in the CG. The between group comparisons from pre to post 12 weeks were significant for YG improvements (LVEF, P < 0.01, Tei index, P < 0.01, NT pro BNP, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the addition of yoga therapy to standard medical therapy for HF patients has a markedly better effect on cardiac function and reduced myocardial stress measured using NT pro BNP in patients with stable HF.

24737651	Australian men with cancer practice complementary therapies (CTs) as a coping strategy.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore how and why Australian men with cancer practice complementary therapies (CTs) and how their significant others (SOs) contribute to the regular uptake of CTs. METHODS: This qualitative study employed semi-structured interviews with 26 male cancer patients and 24 SOs. Participants were purposefully sampled from a preceding Australian survey investigating the use of CTs in men with cancer (94% response rate and 86% consent rate for follow-up interview). Interviews were conducted in a metropolitan location, and the 43 interview transcripts were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Three core themes were identified: men used CTs as (a) problem-focused coping (e.g., diet modification), (b) emotion-focused coping (e.g., meditation), and (c) meaning-based coping (e.g., prayer). Practicing CTs helped men to cope with physical, emotional, and spiritual concerns, although some men spoke of difficulties with practicing meditation to regulate their emotions. SOs were supportive of men's coping strategies but were only rarely involved in men's emotion-focused coping. CONCLUSIONS: Complementary therapies have the potential to facilitate coping with cancer, independent of any measurable physiological benefit. Our findings suggest that when clinicians engage in conversations about CTs use, they should consider the type of coping strategy employed by their patient. Such information may enhance the efficacy of some interventions (e.g., meditation) and also provide for an opportunity to discuss patients' expectations concerning CTs.

24734859	Movement therapies for the self-management of chronic pain symptoms.	OBJECTIVES: Chronic pain management typically consists of prescription medications or provider-based, behavioral, or interventional procedures which are often ineffective, may be costly, and can be associated with undesirable side effects. Because chronic pain affects the whole person (body, mind, and spirit), patient-centered complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) therapies that acknowledge the patients' roles in their own healing processes have the potential to provide more efficient and comprehensive chronic pain management. Active self-care CIM therapies (ACT-CIM) allow for a more diverse, patient-centered treatment of complex symptoms, promote self-management, and are relatively safe and cost-effective. To date, there are no systematic reviews examining the full range of ACT-CIM used for chronic pain symptom management. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted, using Samueli Institute's rapid evidence assessment of the literature methodology, to rigorously assess both the quality of the research on ACT-CIM modalities and the evidence for their efficacy and effectiveness in treating chronic pain symptoms. A working group of subject matter experts was also convened to evaluate the overall literature pool and develop recommendations for the use and implementation of these modalities. RESULTS: Following key database searches, 146 randomized controlled trials were included in the review, 30 of which investigated movement therapies, as defined by the authors. CONCLUSIONS: This article summarizes the current evidence, quality, efficacy, and safety of these modalities. Recommendations and next steps to move this field of research forward are also discussed. The entire scope of the review is detailed throughout the current Pain Medicine supplement.	Lee, Courtney;Crawford, Cindy;Schoomaker, Eric	2014 Apr
24732111	Hydnocarpus: an ethnopharmacological, phytochemical and pharmacological review.	ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The genus Hydnocarpus (Flacourtiaceae) includes forty species that are spread across the globe. In the Indian System of Medicine, Hydnocarpus pentandrus (Buch.-Ham.) Oken. is primarily used for treating leprosy and other skin disorders. It is known as "Chaulmoogra" and is also used to treat other indications including constipation, inflammation, blood disorders, and worm infestations. Various species of Hydnocarpus are also used in traditional medicine in China, Thailand, Malaysia, and Myanmar for several skin disorders. To assess the therapeutic potential of species from the Hydnocarpus genus and to determine future avenues for research. METHODS: All relevant scientific literature published up to the end of December 2013 was retrieved via a library and electronic search (SciFinder, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar). Manual searches of traditional books like to ancient classics, including Vaidya Yoga Ratnavali, Siddha Materia Medica, and contemporary references including The Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India and The Ayurveda Formulary, were also performed. RESULTS: Seed oil from species of the Hydnocarpus genus is used for medicinal purposes, predominantly for various skin disorders. This oil is reported to contain a characteristic class of compounds known as cyclopentenyl fatty acids. Furthermore, seeds of this genus are reported to contain triglycerides of fatty acids, sterols, flavonoids, and flavonolignans. Hydnocarpin, a flavonolignan, is reported to potentiate antimicrobial and anticancer activity. The extracts and compounds isolated from this plant show a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties, including antibacterial, antileprotic, antitubercular, antipsoriatic, antirheumatic, hypolipidemic, antidiabetic, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities. The antileprotic activity is postulated to be due to the cyclopentenyl fatty acids present in the seed oil. CONCLUSION: Flavonolignans have an interesting chemical motif, and hydnocarpin and its congeners should be investigated for their activities and the mechanism underlying these activities. Multi-drug-resistant microbes are on the increase, and the possible inhibitory effect of these compounds when used with current antimicrobials should also be evaluated. Furthermore, unique cyclopentenyl fatty acids should also be investigated to understand the exact mechanism of action underlying antileprotic activity. Additional in depth phytochemical investigations of seed oil and extracts are required to tap the true potential of species from the Hydnocarpus genus.

24731894	Core muscle function during specific yoga poses.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the potential use of 11 yoga poses in specific training and rehabilitation programs via examination of the muscle activation patterns in selected trunk and hip muscles. DESIGN: Repeated-measures descriptive study. SETTING: University laboratory, US. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty healthy yoga practitioners with more than 3 months yoga practice experience (mean age+/-SD, 32.0+/-12.3 y; 8 M/22 F) participated. INTERVENTIONS: Surface electromyographic signals of upper rectus abdominis, lower rectus abdominis, longissimus thoracis, external oblique abdominis and gluteus maximum muscle were recorded in 11 yoga poses: Halfway lift, Forward fold, Downward facing dog, Upward facing dog, High plank, Low plank, Chair, Mountain with arms down, Mountain with arms up, Warrior 1 (both sides). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Root mean square values of each muscle during each pose, normalized by the maximal voluntary contraction. RESULTS: There were significant main effects of pose (p<.001) and muscle (p<.001), and a significant posexmuscle interaction (p=.001). The post hoc analysis revealed unique patterns for the five muscles of interest for each of the 11 poses (p<.024). CONCLUSIONS: Variations in core muscle firing patterns depend on the trunk and pelvic positions during these poses. Training programs can be developed by choosing particular poses to target specific core muscles for addressing low back pain and declines in performance. The High plank, Low plank and Downward facing dog poses are effective for strengthening external oblique abdominis, Chair and Warrior 1 poses for targeting gluteus maximum, and Chair and Halfway lift poses for strengthening longissimus thoracis. And these three muscles could be strengthened by the Upward facing dog pose.	Ni, Meng;Mooney, Kiersten;Harriell, Kysha;Balachandran, Anoop;Signorile, Joseph	2014 Apr
24731893	Effects of yoga practice on stress-related symptoms in the aftermath of an earthquake: A community-based controlled trial.	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of an integrated hatha yoga practice on perceived stress and stress-related symptoms in the aftermath of an earthquake. DESIGN AND SETTING: Inhabitants, aged 20-67 years, from highly exposed earthquake areas of two villages in South Iceland were offered to participate in a yoga program subsequent to an earthquake. Sixty-six individuals were self-selected into the study and divided by residential convenience into an experimental group (n=31) and a waiting list control group (n=35). INTERVENTION: The yoga program was conducted twice a week for six weeks, in normal situations among the inhabitants in the community. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Several validated questionnaires assessing stress and stress-related symptoms, posttraumatic symptoms, depression, anxiety and health related quality of life were administered at pre- and post-intervention. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed differences between the experimental group and waiting list control group on sleep quality (p=.03) and social relations (p=.04). These differences did not prevail at Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (at alpha level of .005). Participants in both groups showed significant improvements in stress and some stress-related symptoms such as sleep, concentration, well-being, quality of life, depression and anxiety from pre- to post-intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The data from this small study show no statistically significant improvement of an integrated hatha yoga program above and beyond waiting list control, following exposure to an earthquake. However, the observed trend toward improved sleep quality and social relations deserve further exploration in larger effectiveness studies on the impact of Hatha yoga on recovery after natural disaster.

24726950	Use of complementary and alternative medicine in an urban county hospital epilepsy clinic.	We examined self-reported complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among a largely indigent population with epilepsy. Overall CAM use was 70%, with the most frequently reported complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) being medical marijuana (33%), prayer/spirituality (31%), meditation (19%), vitamins (19%), and stress management (16%). Forty-four percent of patients reported improved seizure control with CAMs. Stress management accounted for perceived seizure reduction in 74%, followed by marijuana (54%), prayer (49%), and yoga (42%). Among the most commonly used and helpful CAMs, stress management was not associated with specific demographic or clinical variables; marijuana use was significantly associated with lower age (users=35.2+/-10 years vs. nonusers=41.6+/-12; p<0.01) and lower income (under $15,000 40% use vs. 14% over $15,000; p<0.05); and prayer was significantly associated with female gender (male=21% vs. female=45%; p<0.01) and Black ethnicity (Black=55% vs. Hispanic=30% vs. White=23%; p<0.05). Taken together, our study was notable for the high rate of CAM utilization in a largely indigent population, with high rates of perceived efficacy among several CAM modalities.

24726322	Normalizing and scaling of data to derive human response corridors from impact tests.	It is well known that variability is inherent in any biological experiment. Human cadavers (Post-Mortem Human Subjects, PMHS) are routinely used to determine responses to impact loading for crashworthiness applications including civilian (motor vehicle) and military environments. It is important to transform measured variables from PMHS tests (accelerations, forces and deflections) to a standard or reference population, termed normalization. The transformation process should account for inter-specimen variations with some underlying assumptions used during normalization. Scaling is a process by which normalized responses are converted from one standard to another (example, mid-size adult male to large-male and small-size female adults, and to pediatric populations). These responses are used to derive corridors to assess the biofidelity of anthropomorphic test devices (crash dummies) used to predict injury in impact environments and design injury mitigating devices. This survey examines the pros and cons of different approaches for obtaining normalized and scaled responses and corridors used in biomechanical studies for over four decades. Specifically, the equal-stress equal-velocity and impulse-momentum methods along with their variations are discussed in this review. Methods ranging from subjective to quasi-static loading to different approaches are discussed for deriving temporal mean and plus minus one standard deviation human corridors of time-varying fundamental responses and cross variables (e.g., force-deflection). The survey offers some insights into the potential efficacy of these approaches with examples from recent impact tests and concludes with recommendations for future studies. The importance of considering various parameters during the experimental design of human impact tests is stressed.	Yoganandan, Narayan;Arun, Mike W J;Pintar, Frank A	2014 Jun 3
24726198	Yoga for asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Although yoga is frequently used by patients with asthma, its efficacy in alleviating asthma remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To systematically assess and meta-analyze the available data on efficacy and safety of yoga in alleviating asthma. METHODS: MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, CAM-Quest, CAMbase, and IndMED were searched through January 2014. Randomized controlled trials of yoga for patients with asthma were included if they assessed asthma control, symptoms, quality of life, and/or pulmonary function. For each outcome, standardized mean differences (SMDs) or risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool. RESULTS: Fourteen randomized controlled trials with 824 patients were included. Evidence for effects of yoga compared with usual care was found for asthma control (RR, 10.64; 95% CI, 1.98 to 57.19; P = .006), asthma symptoms (SMD, -0.37; 95% CI, -0.55 to -0.19; P < .001), quality of life (SMD, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.39 to 1.33; P < .001), peak expiratory flow rate (SMD, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.67; P < .001), and ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (SMD, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.75; P < .001); evidence for effects of yoga compared with psychological interventions was found for quality of life (SMD, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.99; P = .002) and peak expiratory flow rate (SMD, 2.87; 95% CI, 0.14 to 5.60; P = .04). No evidence for effects of yoga compared with sham yoga or breathing exercises was revealed. No effect was robust against all potential sources of bias. Yoga was not associated with serious adverse events. CONCLUSION: Yoga cannot be considered a routine intervention for asthmatic patients at this point. It can be considered an ancillary intervention or an alternative to breathing exercises for asthma patients interested in complementary interventions.

24725784	Yoga meets positive psychology: examining the integration of hedonic (gratitude) and eudaimonic (meaning) wellbeing in relation to the extent of yoga practice.	The present study aims to explore the existence of a relationship between the extent of yoga practice and two dimensions of psychological wellbeing: meaning in life and gratitude. Both of the variables are positive psychology constructs; there is theoretical affinity and empirical evidence that they are related to overall psychological wellbeing. One hundred and twenty four participants aged 18 years and above, with yoga experience ranging from none to over six years, responded to a number of scales. The extent of yoga practice was measured by the number of years during which individuals practiced yoga at least two times a week. Participants responded to the following scales: MLQ (Meaning in Life Questionnaire) and GQ-6 (Gratitude Questionnaire). This study hypothesised that the number of years practicing yoga would be positively correlated to the score obtained on the aforementioned scales. Positive correlations were identified between the extent of yoga practice and meaning in life and gratitude. Important implications regarding the contribution of yoga to both hedonic and Eudaimonic happiness are discussed.	Ivtzan, Itai;Papantoniou, Angeliki	2014 Apr
24719008	[Behavioral activation and depression: a contextual treatment approach].	Depression is a widespread psychological disorder that affects approximately one in five North American. Typical reactions to depression include inactivity, isolation, and rumination. Several treatments and psychological interventions have emerged to address this problematic. Cognitive behavioural therapies have received increasingly large amounts of empirical support. A sub-component of cognitive behavioural therapy, behavioural activation, has been shown to in itself effectively treat symptoms of depression. This intervention involves efforts to re-activate the depressed client by having them engage in pleasant, gratifying, leisure, social, or physical activities, thereby counteracting the tendency to be inactive and to isolate oneself. Clients are guided through the process of establishing a list of potentially rewarding social, leisure, mastery-oriented or physical activities, to then establish a gradual hierarchy of objectives to be accomplished over the span of several weeks. Concrete action plans are devised, and solutions to potential obstacles are elaborated. The client is the asked to execute the targeted objective and to record their mood prior to and following the activity. Behavioural activation effectively reverses the downward spiral to depression. Interestingly, studies show that behavioural activation has a positive effect on cognitive activities. It has been shown to reduce rumination and favour cognitive restructuring, without requiring cognitively-based interventions. The advantage of this treatment is therefore that it is simpler to administer in comparison to full-packaged cognitive behavioural therapies, it requires a lesser number of sessions and can be disseminated in a low-intensity format. This article begins by summarizing the origins of the behavioural model of depression, which serves as a basis to the understanding of behavioural activation. This is followed by a detailed explanation of the different phases involved in a behavioural activation intervention. Empirical support for behavioural activation is then presented in regards to depression as well as comorbid physical and psychological health problems. The results of meta-analyses and randomized controlled trials are presented. Behavioural activation is then discussed within the framework of third-wave therapies, discussing the potential role of mindfulness in behavioural activation objectives. Specifically, it is suggested that mindfulness, although not necessarily directly addressed in behavioural activation interventions, is an integral part of this intervention as clients are asked to record their mood and activities and to become cognizant of the relationship between their symptoms of depression and the participation in activities that provide positive reinforcement. This favours self-awareness and allows clients to realize the impact of their actions on their physical and psychological states. In engaging in self-observation and self-recording, and in participating in a variety of tasks and activities, clients are indirectly encouraged to focus on the here and now rather that to succumb to the depressive tendency that is to ruminate. Suggestions are made as to how therapists can include mindfulness-based activities in the behavioural activation hierarchy. It is hypothesized that, due to the calming effect of mindfulness practices on the nervous system, incorporating mindfulness-based activities-such as yoga, tai chi, Qi Gong, or meditation-could for some people enhance the efficacy of behavioural activation interventions and foster a greater sense of well-being. The article concludes by discussing issues that should be addressed in future research. It is suggested that future studies on behavioural activation explore the impacts of incorporating mindfulness-based activities in the behavioural activation hierarchy in comparison to a traditional hierarchy limited to the accomplishment of gratifying or mastery-oriented tasks, social outings, leisure activities and physical activity.

24716775	Inter-method reliability of paper surveys and computer assisted telephone interviews in a randomized controlled trial of yoga for low back pain.	BACKGROUND: Little is known about the reliability of different methods of survey administration in low back pain trials. This analysis was designed to determine the reliability of responses to self-administered paper surveys compared to computer assisted telephone interviews (CATI) for the primary outcomes of pain intensity and back-related function, and secondary outcomes of patient satisfaction, SF-36, and global improvement among participants enrolled in a study of yoga for chronic low back pain. RESULTS: Pain intensity, back-related function, and both physical and mental health components of the SF-36 showed excellent reliability at all three time points; ICC scores ranged from 0.82 to 0.98. Pain medication use showed good reliability; kappa statistics ranged from 0.68 to 0.78. Patient satisfaction had moderate to excellent reliability; ICC scores ranged from 0.40 to 0.86. Global improvement showed poor reliability at 6 weeks (ICC = 0.24) and 12 weeks (ICC = 0.10). CONCLUSION: CATI shows excellent reliability for primary outcomes and at least some secondary outcomes when compared to self-administered paper surveys in a low back pain yoga trial. Having two reliable options for data collection may be helpful to increase response rates for core outcomes in back pain trials. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01761617.

24715879	Frontal hemodynamic responses to high frequency yoga breathing in schizophrenia: a functional near-infrared spectroscopy study.	Frontal hemodynamic responses to high frequency yoga breathing technique, Kapalabhati (KB), were compared between patients of schizophrenia (n = 18; 14 males, 4 females) and age, gender, and education matched healthy subjects (n = 18; 14 males, 4 females) using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. The diagnosis was confirmed by a psychiatrist using DSM-IV. All patients except one received atypical antipsychotics (one was on typical). They had obtained a stabilized state as evidenced by a steady unchanged medication from their psychiatrist for the past 3 months or longer. They learned KB, among other yoga procedures, in a yoga retreat. KB was practiced at the rate of 120 times/min for 1 min. Healthy subjects who were freshly learning yoga too were taught KB. Both the groups had no previous exposure to KB practice and the training was carried out over 2 weeks. A chest pressure transducer was used to monitor the frequency and intensity of the practice objectively. The frontal hemodynamic response in terms of the oxygenated hemoglobin (oxyHb), deoxygenated hemoglobin (deoxyHb), and total hemoglobin (totalHb) or blood volume concentration was tapped for 5 min before, 1 min during, and for 5 min after KB. This was obtained in a quiet room using a 16-channel functional near-infrared system (FNIR100-ACK-W, BIOPAC Systems, Inc., USA). The average of the eight channels for each side (right and left frontals) was obtained for the three sessions. The changes in the levels of oxyHb, deoxyHb, and blood volume for the three sessions were compared between the two groups using independent samples t-test. Within group comparison showed that the increase in bilateral oxyHb and totalHb from the baseline was highly significant in healthy controls during KB (right oxyHb, p = 0.00; left oxyHb, p = 0.00 and right totalHb, p = 0.01; left totalHb, p = 0.00), whereas schizophrenia patients did not show any significant changes in the same on both the sides. On the other hand, schizophrenia patients showed significant reduction in deoxyHb in the right pre-frontal cortex (right deoxyHb, p = 0.00). Comparison between the groups showed that schizophrenia patients have reduced bilateral pre-frontal activation (right oxyHb, p = 0.01; left oxyHb, p = 0.03 and right total Hb, p = 0.03; left total Hb, p = 0.04) during KB as compared to healthy controls. This hypo-frontality of schizophrenia patients in response to KB may be used clinically to support the diagnosis of schizophrenia in future.

24703167	Yoga reduces inflammatory signaling in fatigued breast cancer survivors: a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Yoga is a popular mind-body therapy that has demonstrated beneficial effects on psychological, behavioral, and functional outcomes. However, few studies have investigated effects on inflammatory processes. This study tested the hypothesis that an Iyengar yoga intervention specifically designed for fatigued breast cancer survivors would lead to decreases in inflammation-related gene expression and circulating markers of proinflammatory cytokine activity. METHODS: Breast cancer survivors with persistent cancer-related fatigue were randomized to a 12-week Iyengar yoga intervention (n=16) or a 12-week health education control condition (n=15). Blood samples were collected at baseline, post-intervention, and at a 3-month follow-up for genome-wide transcriptional profiling and bioinformatic analyses. Plasma inflammatory markers and salivary cortisol were also assessed. RESULTS: In promoter-based bioinformatics analyses, the yoga group showed reduced activity of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), increased activity of the anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid receptor, and reduced activity of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) family transcription factors relative to controls (all ps<.05). There was also a significant intervention effect on the soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor type II (sTNF-RII), a marker of TNF activity; plasma levels of sTNF-RII remained stable in the yoga group, whereas levels of this marker increased in the health education group (p=.028). A similar, non-significant trend was observed for the interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (p=.16). No significant changes in C reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), or diurnal cortisol measures were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A 12-week restorative Iyengar yoga intervention reduced inflammation-related gene expression in breast cancer survivors with persistent fatigue. These findings suggest that a targeted yoga program may have beneficial effects on inflammatory activity in this patient population, with potential relevance for behavioral and physical health.

24702211	The effectiveness of yoga for depression: a critical literature review.	In the United States, the prevalence of depression is quite high-9% in the general population-with women, young adults, and seniors particularly vulnerable. In recent years, increasing numbers of people are turning to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for relief from depression and other mental health problems. One form of CAM, yoga, has been growing in popularity; this rise in popularity has, in part, been driven by interest in how this practice, with its mindfulness and meditation aspects, may decrease depression. This critical literature review examines six recent studies on yoga as an intervention; specifically, this review focuses on yoga styles in which the practice of yoga poses, called asanas, is the core component. Although the significant positive findings are promising, the studies had methodological limitations; identification of these limitations can inform future studies.	Louie, Lila	2014 Apr
24698988	Ayurveda for chemo-radiotherapy induced side effects in cancer patients.	Chemotherapy drugs and radiotherapy are highly toxic and both damage adjacent healthy cells. Side effects may be acute (occurring within few weeks after therapy), intermediate or late (occurring months or years after the therapy). Some important side effects of chemotherapy are: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, alopecia, constipation etc; whereas radiation therapy though administered locally, can produce systemic side effects such as fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, alteration in the taste, sleep disturbance, headache, anemia, dry skin, constipation etc. Late complications of these therapies also include pharyngitis, esophagitis, laryngitis, persistent dysphagia, fatigue, hepatotoxicity, infertility and cognitive deficits. These arrays of side effects have a devastating effect on the quality of life of cancer survivors. Due to the inadequacy of most of the radio-protectors and chemo-protectors in controlling the side effects of conventional cancer therapy the complementary and alternative medicines have attracted the view of researchers and medical practitioners more recently. This review aims at providing a comprehensive management protocol of above mentioned chemo-radiotherapy induced side effects based on Ayurveda, which is an ancient system of traditional medicine practiced in Indian peninsula since 5000 BC. When the major side effects of chemo-radiotherapy are looked through an ayurvedic perspective, it appears that they are the manifestations of aggravated pitta dosha, especially under the group of disorders called Raktapitta (haemorrhage) or Raktadushti (vascular inflammation). Based on comprehensive review of ancient vedic literature and modern scientific evidences, ayurveda based interventions are put forth. This manuscript should help clinicians and people suffering from cancer to combat serious chemo-radiotherapy related side effects through simple but effective home-based ayurveda remedies. The remedies described are commonly available and safe. These simple ayurveda based solutions may act as an important adjuvant to chemo-radiotherapy and enhance the quality of life of cancer patients.

24695779	Effects of Medhya Rasayana and Yogic practices in improvement of short-term memory among school-going children.	Excellent memory, extraordinary intelligence, great academic achievement, and successful career are the dreams of every individual in this era of competition and professionalism. A good memory power acts as a catalyst in all walks of life, be it academic success or maintenance of personal relationships. It is observed that an average man uses only 10% of his natural memory. Remaining 90% is left unused in a haphazard manner. As per the American psychologist Carl Emil Seashore, if one is alert and makes systematic attempts to awaken and use the natural memory properly, his/her natural memory would be activated creatively and would offer benefits of higher order. A comparative study was conducted comprising 90 subjects to know the efficacy of Medhya Rasayana and Yogic practices in short-term memory of school-going children. The study was conducted over a period of 3 months. It was an open, prospective, and randomized clinical study. The subjects of group A formed the control group and they were observed silently for 3 months without any intervention. The subjects in group B were administered with Choorna (powder) of four Medhya Rasayanas, Mandukaparni (Centella asiatica Linn.), Yashtimadhu (Glycyrrhiza glabra Linn.), Guduchi [Tinospora cordifolia (Willd.) Miers ex Hook. f. and Thoms.], and Sankhapushpi (Convolvulus pluricaulis Choisy), at a dose of 2 g twice daily with milk. Subjects belonging to group C were advocated regular Yogic practices of Asanas, Pranayama, and Dhyana. Further study revealed that among the three groups, group B treated with Medhya Rasayana showed highly significant and most effective changes with respect to objective parameters in the tests, i.e. (1) short-term memory test pictures and (2) serial recall effects test using memory scope. Among the three groups, group C treated with Yogic practices showed highly significant and most effective changes with respect to subjective and objective parameters in mini mental status scale i.e. test 3. The treatment is cost effective and devoid of side effects, which can be beneficial for the community. Mean increase after first follow-up in group B was higher as compared to group C. This shows that Medhya Rasayanas are quick in action and bring about improvement in memory faster when compared with Yogic practices. So, on the whole, group B can be considered to be the most efficient among the three groups.	Sarokte, Atul Shankar;Rao, Mangalagowri V	2013 Oct
24695505	Diagnosis and initial management of dysmenorrhea.	Dysmenorrhea is one of the most common causes of pelvic pain. It negatively affects patients' quality of life and sometimes results in activity restriction. A history and physical examination, including a pelvic examination in patients who have had vaginal intercourse, may reveal the cause. Primary dysmenorrhea is menstrual pain in the absence of pelvic pathology. Abnormal uterine bleeding, dyspareunia, noncyclic pain, changes in intensity and duration of pain, and abnormal pelvic examination findings suggest underlying pathology (secondary dysmenorrhea) and require further investigation. Transvaginal ultrasonography should be performed if secondary dysmenorrhea is suspected. Endometriosis is the most common cause of secondary dysmenorrhea. Symptoms and signs of adenomyosis include dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, and a uniformly enlarged uterus. Management options for primary dysmenorrhea include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and hormonal contraceptives. Hormonal contraceptives are the first-line treatment for dysmenorrhea caused by endometriosis. Topical heat, exercise, and nutritional supplementation may be beneficial in patients who have dysmenorrhea; however, there is not enough evidence to support the use of yoga, acupuncture, or massage.

24677282	Mindfulness-based stress reduction for older adults with worry symptoms and co-occurring cognitive dysfunction.	BACKGROUND: Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) has the potential to reduce worry and improve cognitive functioning. OBJECTIVES: In this treatment development project, we examined MBSR in older adults with worry symptoms and co-occurring cognitive dysfunction. We examined (i) acceptability of MBSR, (ii) whether MBSR needs to be lengthened providing more repetition, (iii) MBSR's benefits for worry reduction and cognitive improvements, and (iv) continued use of MBSR techniques during follow-up. METHODS: Two sites (St. Louis and San Diego) enrolled individuals aged 65 years or older with significant anxiety-related distress plus subjective cognitive dysfunction, into traditional 8-session MBSR groups and 12-session groups that had the same content but more repetition of topics and techniques. We examined measures of mindfulness, worry, and a neuropsychological battery focused on memory and executive function before and after the MBSR program, and we followed up participants for 6 months after the completion of MBSR regarding their continued use of its techniques. RESULTS: Participants (N = 34) showed improvements in worry severity, increases in mindfulness, and improvements in memory as measured by paragraph learning and recall after a delay, all with a large effect size. Most participants continued to use MBSR techniques for 6 months post-instruction and found them helpful in stressful situations. There was no evidence that the extended 12-week MBSR produced superior cognitive or clinical outcomes, greater satisfaction, or greater continuation of MBSR techniques than 8-week MBSR. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings are promising for the further testing and use of MBSR in older adults suffering from clinical worry symptoms and co-occurring cognitive dysfunction. These are common problems in a broad range of older adults, many of whom have anxiety and mood disorders; therefore, stress reduction intervention for them may have great public health value.

24676593	Complementary and Alternative Medicine for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms: A Systematic Review.	OBJECTIVES.: To (1) characterize complementary and alternative medicine studies for posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, (2) evaluate the quality of these studies, and (3) systematically grade the scientific evidence for individual CAM modalities for posttraumatic stress disorder. DESIGN.: Systematic review. Eight data sources were searched. Selection criteria included any study design assessing posttraumatic stress disorder outcomes and any complementary and alternative medicine intervention. The body of evidence for each modality was assessed with the Natural Standard evidence-based, validated grading rationale. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS.: Thirty-three studies (n = 1329) were reviewed. Scientific evidence of benefit for posttraumatic stress disorder was strong for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and good for acupuncture, hypnotherapy, meditation, and visualization. Evidence was unclear or conflicting for biofeedback, relaxation, Emotional Freedom and Thought Field therapies, yoga, and natural products. Considerations for clinical applications and future research recommendations are discussed.	Wahbeh, Helane;Senders, Angela;Neuendorf, Rachel;Cayton, Julien	2014 Jul
24673148	Transcendental experiences during meditation practice.	This article explores transcendental experiences during meditation practice and the integration of transcendental experiences and the unfolding of higher states of consciousness with waking, dreaming, and sleeping. The subject/object relationship during transcendental experiences is characterized by the absence of time, space, and body sense--the framework that gives meaning to waking experiences. Physiologically, transcendental experiences during Transcendental Meditation practice are marked by slow inhalation, along with autonomic orientation at the onset of breath changes and heightened alpha1 (8-10 Hz) frontal coherence. The integration of transcendental experiences with waking, dreaming, and sleeping is also marked by distinct subjective and objective markers. This integrated state, called Cosmic Consciousness in the Vedic tradition, is subjectively marked by inner self-awareness coexisting with waking, sleeping, and dreaming. Physiologically, Cosmic Consciousness is marked by the coexistence of alpha1 electroencephalography (EEG) with delta EEG during deep sleep, and higher brain integration, greater emotional stability, and decreased anxiety during challenging tasks. Transcendental experiences may be the engine that fosters higher human development.	Travis, Frederick	2014 Jan
24668767	A pilot study of a randomized controlled trial of yoga as an intervention for PTSD symptoms in women.	Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating condition that affects approximately 10% of women in the United States. Although effective psychotherapeutic treatments for PTSD exist, clients with PTSD report additional benefits of complementary and alternative approaches such as yoga. In particular, yoga may downregulate the stress response and positively impact PTSD and comorbid depression and anxiety symptoms. We conducted a pilot study of a randomized controlled trial comparing a 12-session Kripalu-based yoga intervention with an assessment control group. Participants included 38 women with current full or subthreshold PTSD symptoms. During the intervention, yoga participants showed decreases in reexperiencing and hyperarousal symptoms. The assessment control group, however, showed decreases in reexperiencing and anxiety symptoms as well, which may be a result of the positive effect of self-monitoring on PTSD and associated symptoms. Between-groups effect sizes were small to moderate (0.08-0.31). Although more research is needed, yoga may be an effective adjunctive treatment for PTSD. Participants responded positively to the intervention, suggesting that it was tolerable for this sample. Findings underscore the need for future research investigating mechanisms by which yoga may impact mental health symptoms, gender comparisons, and the long-term effects of yoga practice.

24661723	Yoga practice in England 1997-2008: prevalence, temporal trends, and correlates of participation.	BACKGROUND: Yoga is a holistic practice that may offer several health benefits. No study has examined the prevalence, temporal trends, or correlates of yoga practice at the population level in a European country and very few such studies exist worldwide. The objective of the study is to examine the prevalence, trends and correlates of yoga practice in England between 1997 and 2008. FINDINGS: Analysis was conducted in early 2013 using Health Survey for England data. Independent cohorts, representative of adults living in England, were surveyed in annual cycles in 1997-1999, 2003-2004, and 2006/2008. Prevalence of yoga practice (defined as any practice in the past four weeks) was determined at each time point and multiple logistic regression was used to examine temporal trends (using 1997-1999 as reference time point) and the correlates of yoga practice. The prevalence of yoga practice was 0.46% (95% CI: 0.39%-0.52%) in 1997-1999, 0.94% (0.83%-1.06%) in 2003-2004, and 1.11% (0.95%-1.28%) in 2006/2008. Yoga participants in England were more likely to be older, female, degree educated, of non-manual social class, lower BMI, better self-rated general health, inactive occupation, and higher moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Adjusted for age, sex, social class, and long standing illnesses, there was a significant increasing trend of yoga practice from 1997 to 2008 (2003/04 OR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.59-2.34; 2006/08 OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.77-2.71). CONCLUSIONS: Yoga practice has increased in popularity, though the absolute rates are still relatively low. Future population studies should more comprehensively examine the contexts, settings, styles, correlates and health benefits of yoga practice.	Ding, Ding;Stamatakis, Emmanuel	2014 Mar 24
24657958	Yoga and hypertension: a systematic review.	Lifestyle modification is a cornerstone of hypertension (HPT) treatment, yet most recommendations currently focus on diet and exercise and do not consider stress reduction strategies. Yoga is a spiritual path that may reduce blood pressure (BP) through reducing stress, increasing parasympathetic activation, and altering baroreceptor sensitivity; however, despite reviews on yoga and cardiovascular disease, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and anxiety that suggest yoga may reduce BP, no comprehensive review has yet focused on yoga and HPT. A systematic review of all published studies on yoga and HPT was performed revealing 39 cohort studies, 30 nonrandomized, controlled trials (NRCTs), 48 randomized, controlled trials (RCTs), and 3 case reports with durations ranging from 1 wk to 4 y and involving a total of 6693 subjects. Most studies reported that yoga effectively reduced BP in both normotensive and hypertensive populations. These studies suggest that yoga is an effective adjunct therapy for HPT and worthy of inclusion in clinical guidelines, yet the great heterogeneity of yoga practices and the variable quality of the research makes it difficult to recommend any specific yoga practice for HPT. Future research needs to focus on high quality clinical trials along with studies on the mechanisms of action of different yoga practices.	Tyagi, Anupama;Cohen, Marc	2014 Mar-Apr
24657956	Is yoga training beneficial for exercise-induced bronchoconstriction?	BACKGROUND: Some studies have shown the beneficial effects of yoga for individuals with bronchial hyperreactivity with regard to (1) a reduction in the use of rescue medication, (2) an increase in exercise capacity, and (3) an improvement in lung function. Despite the fact that yoga is promising as a new treatment for pediatric patients, further studies are needed to assess the use of this training for asthma management. OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to assess the beneficial effects of yoga in exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in children. DESIGN: The study was prospective, with no control group. Participants were randomly chosen among the new patients at the unit. SETTING: This study was conducted in the Erciyes University School of Medicine, Pediatric Allergy Unit, in Kayseri, Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: Two groups of asthmatic children aged 6-17 y were enrolled in the study: (1) children with positive responses to an exercise challenge (n = 10), and (2) those with negative responses (n = 10). INTERVENTION: Both groups attended 1-h sessions of yoga training 2 x/wk for 3 mo. OUTCOME MEASURES: Researchers administered spirometric measurement to all children before and immediately after participating in an exercise challenge. This process was performed at baseline and at the study's end. Age, gender, IgE levels, eosinophil numbers, and spirometric measurement parameters including forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1), forced expiratory flow 25%-75% (FEF25%-75%), forced vital capacity (FVC), peak expiratory flow percentage (PEF%), and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test and the Wilcoxon test. A P value < .05 was considered significant. RESULTS: At baseline, no significant differences were observed between the groups regarding demographics or pre-exercise spirometric measurements (P > .05, Mann-Whitney U test). Likewise, no significant differences in spirometric measurements existed between the groups regarding the change in responses to an exercise challenge after yoga training (P > .05, Wilcoxon test). For the exercise-response-positive group, the research team observed a significant improvement in maximum forced expiratory volume 1% (FEV1%) fall following the exercise challenge after yoga training (P > .05, Wilcoxon test). All exercise-response-positive asthmatics became exerciseresponse-negative asthmatics after yoga training. CONCLUSION: This study showed that training children in the practice of yoga had beneficial effects on EIB. It is the research team's opinion that yoga training can supplement drug therapy to achieve better control of asthma.	Tahan, Fulya;Eke Gungor, Hatice;Bicici, Emine	2014 Mar-Apr

24655636	Predictors of family caregiver burden in schizophrenia: Study from an in-patient tertiary care hospital in India.	BACKGROUND: Family caregivers experience significant burden in taking care of their patients with schizophrenia. Research on predictors of caregiver burden in India, where families are the primary caregivers of schizophrenia patients, is lacking. AIM: To study the predictors of burden experienced by the family caregivers of first admission in-patient schizophrenia patients in India. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Family caregivers of 137 schizophrenia patients admitted to an in-patient facility of a hospital in south India were interviewed using the Burden Assessment Schedule. The coping, knowledge about schizophrenia, perceived social support of the caregivers and illness severity, psychopathology and disability experienced by the patients were also assessed. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Bivariate correlation and multivariate regression analysis were used to study the association of different factors on burden. RESULTS: Duration of illness and levels of psychopathology and disability had significant direct correlation with total burden score; perceived social support had significant inverse correlation with total burden score. There was a high correlation between psychopathology and disability (p<0.001). Two separate regression analyses, each including total PANSS score (psychopathology) or total IDEAS score (disability) showed that duration of illness and perceived social support were significant predictors of burden in addition to psychopathology and disability. CONCLUSION: During the first hospitalization, in addition to symptom reduction and disability limitation, focus should be on enhancing social support in order to reduce caregiver burden among family members of schizophrenia patients.

24655586	The influence of Hatha yoga as an add-on treatment in major depression on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis activity: a randomized trial.	OBJECTIVES: The impact of Hatha yoga as add-on treatment to quetiapine fumarate extended release (QXR) or escitalopram (ESC) in depressed patients on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity was assessed. METHODS: 60 inpatients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD) according to DSM-IV were randomized for a 5 week treatment with Yoga or not (control group) and with either QXR (300 mg/day) or ESC (10 mg/day). Serial dexamethasone/corticotropin releasing hormone (DEX/CRH) tests were performed to assess HPA axis function. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (21-HAMD) was used weekly. RESULTS: A more pronounced down regulation of the HPA axis activity due to yoga could not be detected. The stepwise long term cortisol reduction was seen in both medication groups, irrespectively of yoga add-on treatment. In addition, cortisol improvers in week 1 of therapy (reduction in cortisol peak value within the DEX/CRH test) reached significant greater amelioration of depressive symptoms after 5 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that antidepressant agents down regulate HPA axis function to a greater extent than additional Hatha yoga treatment. Moreover, an early reduction of HPA system hyperactivity after one week of pharmacological treatment seems to raise the possibility of a favorable treatment response.

24654357	Yoga induced acute ulnar nerve compression by a ganglion cyst in Guyon's canal.	Acute ulnar neuropathy at the wrist can be difficult to diagnose, as it is an uncommon neuropathy with variable clinical presentations and numerous etiologies. We present a case of acute ulnar neuropathy of the deep motor branch caused by a ganglion cyst in Guyon's canal. Interestingly, this case of acute loss of motor function occurred after the patient participated in yoga (specifically the downward dog position), and resolved spontaneously over time after stopping yoga, without surgical excision of the ganglion, suggesting exacerbation or protrusion of an occult ganglion cyst due to increased activity and compression of the hypothenar eminence.

24648794	PTSD and comorbid AUD: a review of pharmacological and alternative treatment options.	BACKGROUND: Although posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorders (AUD) frequently co-occur there are no specific treatments for individuals diagnosed with these comorbid conditions. The main objectives of this paper are to review the literature on pharmacological options for PTSD and comorbid AUD, and to summarize promising behavioral and alternative interventions for those with these dual diagnoses. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search on PsycINFO and MEDLINE/PubMed databases using Medical Subject Headings terms in various combinations to identify articles that used pharmacotherapy for individuals with dual diagnoses of PTSD and AUD. Similar strategies were used to identify articles on behavioral and alternative treatments for AUD and PTSD. We identified and reviewed six studies that tested pharmacological treatments for patients with PTSD and comorbid AUD. RESULTS: The literature on treatment with US Food and Drug Administration approved medications for patients with dual diagnosis of PTSD and AUD is very limited and inconclusive. Promising evidence indicates that topiramate and prazosin may be effective in reducing PTSD and AUD symptoms in individuals with comorbidity. Seeking safety has had mixed efficacy in clinical trials. The efficacy of other behavioral and alternative treatments (mindfulness-based, yoga, and acupuncture) is more difficult to evaluate since the evidence comes from small, single studies without comparison groups. CONCLUSION: There is a clear need for more systematic and rigorous study of pharmacological, behavioral, and alternative treatments for patients with dual diagnoses of PTSD and AUD.

24648359	Effectiveness of a mindfulness education program in primary health care professionals: a pragmatic controlled trial.	INTRODUCTION: Burnout is a very prevalent type of stress among health professionals. It affects their well-being, performance, and attitude toward patients. This study assessed the effectiveness of a training program for primary health care professionals designed to reduce burnout and mood disturbance, increase empathy, and develop mindfulness. METHODS: Pragmatic randomized controlled trial with pre- and postintervention measurements of 68 primary health care professionals (43 in the intervention and 25 in the control group) in Spain. The intervention consisted of presentations of clinically relevant topics, mindfulness-based coping strategies, mindfulness practice, yoga, and group discussions (8 sessions of 2.5 hours per week plus a 1-day session of 8 hours). Outcome measures included the Maslach Burnout Inventory, Profile of Mood States, Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy, Baer's Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire, and a questionnaire on changes in personal habits and mindfulness practice. Measurements were performed at baseline and after 8 weeks. RESULTS: The intervention group improved in the 4 scales measured. The magnitude of the change was large in total mood disturbance (difference between groups -7.1; standardized effect-size [SES] 1.15) and mindfulness (difference between groups 11; SES 0.9) and moderate in the burnout (difference between groups -7; SES 0.74) and empathy scales (difference between groups 5.2; SES 0.71). No significant differences were found in the control group. DISCUSSION: Our study supports the use of mindfulness-based programs as part of continuing professional education to reduce and prevent burnout, promote positive attitudes among health professionals, strengthen patient-provider relationships, and enhance well-being.

24647380	Yoga as an alternative and complementary approach for stress management: a systematic review.	Stress has become a global public health problem. Yoga offers one possible way of reducing stress. The purpose of this study was to look at studies from 2011 to May 2013 and examine whether yoga can be an efficacious approach for managing stress. A systematic search of Medline, CINAHL, and Alt HealthWatch databases was conducted for quantitative articles involving all schools of yoga. A total of 17 articles met the inclusion criteria. Six of these were from the United States, 3 from India, 2 from the United Kingdom, and 1 each from Australia, Brazil, Germany, Iraq, Sweden, and Taiwan. Of the 17 studies, 12 demonstrated positive changes in psychological or physiological outcomes related to stress. Despite the limitations, not all studies used a randomized controlled design, had smaller sample sizes, had different outcomes, had nonstandardized yoga intervention, and had varying lengths, yoga appears to be a promising modality for stress management.

24647379	Yoga as an alternative and complementary approach for arthritis: a systematic review.	In the United States, approximately 21% of the adults suffer from arthritis. Yoga offers one possible way of managing arthritis. The purpose of this study was to look at studies from 2010 to June 2013 and examine whether yoga can be an efficacious approach for managing arthritis. A systematic search from Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, and Alt HealthWatch databases was conducted for quantitative articles involving all schools of yoga. A total of 9 articles met the inclusion criteria. Five of these were from the United States and 4 from India. Of the 9 studies, 6 demonstrated positive changes in psychological or physiological outcomes related to arthritis. Despite the limitations not all studies using randomized controlled design, having smaller sample sizes, having different outcomes, having nonstandardized yoga intervention, not using behavioral theory, and having varying lengths, yoga appears to be a promising modality for arthritis.

24647095	Between inhale and exhale: yoga as an intervention in smoking cessation.	The current study provided a review of evidence-based yoga interventions' impact on smoking cessation. The researchers reviewed articles obtained from MEDLINE (PubMed), EBSCOHOST, PROQUEST, MEDINDIA, CINAHL, Alt HealthWatch, and AMED databases. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) study published between 2004 and 2013, (b) study published in English language, (c) study used yoga-based interventions, (d) study involved smokers with varying level of smoking, (e) study used any quantitative design, and (f) study had physiological and/or psychological outcomes. A total of 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. Designs were 2 pre-post tests and 8 randomized controlled trials. Majority of the interventions were able to enhance quitting smoking rates in the participants under study. Yoga-based interventions hold promise for smoking cessation. Some of the limitations include short follow-up measurements and short duration of intervention.	Dai, Chia-Liang;Sharma, Manoj	2014 Apr
24642625	Prognostic nomogram for nonresectable pancreatic cancer treated with gemcitabine-based chemotherapy.	BACKGROUND: A nomogram is progressively being used as a useful predictive tool for cancer prognosis. A nomogram to predict survival in nonresectable pancreatic cancer treated with chemotherapy has not been reported. METHODS: Using prospectively collected data on patients with nonresectable pancreatic cancer receiving gemcitabine-based chemotherapy at five Japanese hospitals, we derived a predictive nomogram and internally validated it using a concordance index and calibration plots. RESULTS: In total, 531 patients were included between June 2001 and February 2013. The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM stages were III and IV in 204 and 327 patients, respectively. The median survival time of the total cohort was 11.3 months. A nomogram was generated to predict survival probabilities at 6, 12, and 18 months and median survival time, based on the following six variables: age; sex; performance status; tumour size; regional lymph node metastasis; and distant metastasis. The concordance index of the present nomogram was higher than that of the AJCC TNM staging system at 12 months (0.686 vs 0.612). The calibration plots demonstrated good fitness of the nomogram for survival prediction. CONCLUSIONS: The present nomogram can provide valuable information for tailored decision-making early after the diagnosis of nonresectable pancreatic cancer.

24642209	Validation of the German version of the Neck Disability Index (NDI).	BACKGROUND: The Neck Disability Index (NDI) is the most commonly used outcome measure for neck pain. This study aimed to determine the psychometric properties of a German version of the NDI. Cross-cultural translation and psychometric testing of the NDI were performed. METHODS: The 10-item NDI was translated into German and administered to 558 patients with chronic unspecific neck pain (Mean age 49.9 +/- 11.4 years, 76% female). The factor structure and reliability of the NDI were assessed using factor analysis, Cronbach's alpha, split-half reliability (Spearman-Brown coefficient), and intra-class correlation (ICC2,1). To determine convergent validity, pain intensity (visual analog scale; VAS), pain on movement (VAS), and quality of life (Short Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire; SF-36) were correlated with the NDI. Correlation with range of motion and sensitivity to change were also assessed in a subsample of 49 patients. RESULTS: The mean NDI score was 32.75 +/- 13.09. Factor analysis revealed a single factor that explained 39.8% of the variance. Cronbach's alpha was 0.81; Spearman-Brown coefficient was 0.80; and intra-class correlation was 0.81 (95% confidence interval = 0.78, 0.83). Significant correlations were found for pain intensity (r = 0.22, p < 0.01), pain on movement (r = 0.39, p < 0.01), quality of life (r = -0.30 to -0.45, p < 0.01), and range of motion (r = -0.34, p = 0.02). Patients who reported global improvement of health after an exercise or yoga intervention showed a higher decrease on the NDI than patients who reported no global improvement (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The German version of the NDI has a comparable factor structure as the original version, acceptable psychometric properties, and is sensitive to change after physical activity. Neck disability is associated with other measures of neck pain.	Cramer, Holger;Lauche, Romy;Langhorst, Jost;Dobos, Gustav J;Michalsen, Andreas	2014 Mar 19
24636596	Hatha-yoga as a psychological adjuvant for women undergoing IVF: a pilot study.	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the influence of Hatha-yoga (HY) practice on distress of women before starting their first in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle. STUDY DESIGN: We offered 143 consecutive women with couple infertility the opportunity to attend a free HY course lasting 3 months as a psychological support before starting their first IVF cycle. All women were asked to complete the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Y1 (STAY-Y1), Edinburgh Depression Scale (EDS) and General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) at baseline (T1) and after 3 months (T2), to evaluate symptoms of anxiety, depression and distress, respectively. RESULTS: Of the 143 women, 120 completed all three questionnaires. Of these, 45 attended the HY course and 75 did not. At T1, EDS and GHQ-12 scores were significantly higher in the HY group than in the non-HY group. There were no group differences in STAI-Y1 scores. At T2 there were no group differences. When, in each group, the score of each questionnaire at T1 was compared to the score at T2, a significant T1 to T2 reduction was observed in the HY group (p<0.0001 for STAY-Y1 and GHQ-12, p<0.001 for EDS). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that women who are more distressed are more likely to accept psychological support before starting an IVF cycle and that in these women HY practice is associated with distress reduction.

24636547	Effects of yoga on cardiovascular disease risk factors: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: The aim of this review was to systematically assess and meta-analyze the effects of yoga on modifiable biological cardiovascular disease risk factors in the general population and in high-risk disease groups. METHODS: MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and IndMED were screened through August 2013 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on yoga for predefined cardiovascular risk factors in healthy participants, non-diabetic participants with high risk for cardiovascular disease, or participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: Forty-four RCTs with a total of 3168 participants were included. Risk of bias was high or unclear for most RCTs. Relative to usual care or no intervention, yoga improved systolic (mean difference (MD)=-5.85 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval (CI)=-8.81, -2.89) and diastolic blood pressure (MD=-4.12 mm Hg; 95%CI=-6.55, -1.69), heart rate (MD=-6.59 bpm; 95%CI=-12.89, -0.28), respiratory rate (MD=-0.93 breaths/min; 95%CI=-1.70, -0.15), waist circumference (MD=-1.95 cm; 95%CI=-3.01, -0.89), waist/hip ratio (MD=-0.02; 95%CI=-0.03, -0.00), total cholesterol (MD=-13.09 mg/dl; 95%CI=-19.60, -6.59), HDL (MD=2.94 mg/dl; 95%CI=0.57, 5.31), VLDL (MD=-5.70 mg/dl; 95%CI=-7.36, -4.03), triglycerides (MD=-20.97 mg/dl; 95%CI=-28.61, -13.32), HbA1c (MD=-0.45%; 95%CI=-0.87, -0.02), and insulin resistance (MD=-0.19; 95%CI=-0.30, -0.08). Relative to exercise, yoga improved HDL (MD=3.70 mg/dl; 95%CI=1.14, 6.26). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis revealed evidence for clinically important effects of yoga on most biological cardiovascular disease risk factors. Despite methodological drawbacks of the included studies, yoga can be considered as an ancillary intervention for the general population and for patients with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

24629718	The effects of mindfulness eating and yoga exercise on blood sugar levels of pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus.	AIM: This randomized controlled trial was carried out to investigate the effect of mindfulness eating and yoga exercise on blood sugar levels among pregnant Thai women with GDM. BACKGROUND: Interventions promoting achievement of good glycemic control result in desired pregnancy outcomes. Little is known about the health benefits of mindfulness eating and yoga exercise on blood sugar levels among pregnant with GDM. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was carried out. Main outcome measures were capillary fasting plasma glucose, 2-h postprandial blood glucose, and hemoglobin A1c. RESULTS: The intervention group showed significantly reduced fasting plasma glucose, 2-h postprandial blood glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the intervention group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness eating and yoga exercise had health benefits on glycemic control in pregnant women with GDM. It should be recommended in clinical and community health services.

24620850	Effects of Hatha yoga on blood pressure, salivary alpha-amylase, and cortisol function among normotensive and prehypertensive youth.	OBJECTIVE: Evidence is accumulating, predominantly among clinical trials in adults, that yoga improves blood pressure (BP) control, with downregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) projected as underlying mechanisms. This pilot study assessed whether Hatha yoga has the potential to reduce BP among youth and whether dampening of the SNS and/or HPA activity is a likely pathway of change. DESIGN: Thirty-one seventh graders were randomly assigned to a Hatha yoga program (HYP) or attention control (AC) music or art class. Baseline and 3-month evaluations included resting BP; overnight urine samples; and saliva collected at bedtime, upon awakening, and at 30 and 60 minutes after awakening for alpha-amylase and cortisol assays. RESULTS: Twenty-eight (14 in the HYP group and 14 in the AC group) students were assessed both before and after the intervention. BP changes from pre- to post-intervention were -3.0/-2.0 mmHg for the HYP group and -0.07/-0.79 mmHg for the AC group (p=0.30 and 0.57, respectively). Changes in systolic BP (SBP)/diastolic BP (DBP) for the prehypertensive (75th-94th percentiles for SBP) subgroup analyses were -10.75/-8.25 mmHg for the HYP group (n=4) versus 1.8/1.0 mmHg for the AC group (n=5) (p for SBP=0.02; p for DBP=0.09). Although no statistically significant group differences were observed with changes in SNS or HPA awakening curves (area under curve for alpha-amylase and cortisol, respectively), a small to moderate effect size was seen favoring a reduction of alpha-amylase activation for the HYP group (Cohen d=0.34; prehypertensive d=0.20). CONCLUSIONS: A school-based Hatha yoga program demonstrated potential to decrease resting BP, particularly among prehypertensive youth. Reduced SNS drive may be an underlying neurohormonal pathway beneficially affected by the program. A large-scale efficacy/effectiveness randomized clinical trial is warranted.

24617172	Immediate effects of Suryanamaskar on reaction time and heart rate in female volunteers.	Suryanamaskar (SN), a yogic technique is composed of dynamic muscular movements synchronised with deep rhythmic breathing. As it may have influence on CNS, this study planned to investigate immediate effects of SN on reaction time (RT) and heart rate (HR). 21 female volunteers attending yoga classes were recruited for study group and 19 female volunteers not participating in yoga were recruited as external-controls. HR, auditory reaction time (ART) and visual reaction time (VRT) were recorded before and after three rounds of SN in study group as well as 5 minutes of quiet sitting in both groups. Performance of SN produced immediate decrease in both VRT and ART (P < 0.001). This was significant when compared to self-control period (P < 0.001) and compared to external-control group, it decreased significantly in ART (p = 0.02). This was pronounced when delta% was compared between groups (P < 0.001). HR increased significantly following SN compared with both self-control (p = 0.025) and external-control group (p = 0.032). Faster reactivity may be due to intermediate level of arousal by conscious synchronisation of dynamic movements with breathing. Rise in HR is attributed to sympathetic arousal and muscular exertion. We suggest that SN may be used as an effective training means to improve neuro-muscular abilities.	Bhavanani, Ananda Balayogi;Ramanathan, Meena;Balaji, R;Pushpa, D	2013 Apr-Jun
24617167	Comparison of cardiorespiratory responses between Surya Namaskar and bicycle exercise at similar energy expenditure level.	Surya Namaskar (SN), a popular traditional Indian yogic practice called "Sun Salutations", includes practice of twelve physical postures involving alternate backward bending and forward bending postures. The practice of twelve postures in succession makes one round of its practice. Many people practise it as part of their daily physical fitness regimen. No study is available to compare cardiorespiratory responses of SN with bicycle exercise (BE). 20 healthy Yoga instructors practicing various Yogic practices including SN since last 7-8 years participated in the study. They performed SN in the laboratory according to their customary daily practice routine. The subject also performed incremental load bicycle exercise test till exhaustion on their second visit for measuring their VO2 max. SN and BE were compared at three similar exercise intensity levels in terms of % of VO2 max. The exercise intensities were light (10-20% VO2 max), moderate (21-40% VO2 max) and high intensities (41-50% VO2 max). Heart rate at high work intensity was significantly higher in BE than SN (P < .001). Ventilation and carbon dioxide output were significantly higher in BE than SN at high exercise intensity (P < 0.001). Overall, cardiorespiratory stress is less in SN than BE at similar work intensities.	Sinha, Biswajit;Sinha, Tulika Dasgupta;Pathak, Anjana;Tomer, O S	2013 Apr-Jun
24617165	Effect of yoga on short-term heart rate variability measure as a stress index in subjunior cyclists: a pilot study.	Subjunior athletes experience mental stress due to pressure from the coach, teachers and parents for better performance. Stress, if remains for longer period and not managed appropriately can leads to negative physical, mental and cognitive impact on children. The present study was aimed to evaluate the effect of integrated yoga module on heart rate variability (HRV) measure as a stress index in subjunior cyclists. Fast furrier transform technique of frequency domain method was used for the analysis of HRV. We have found a significant increase in high frequency (HF) component by 14.64% (P < 0.05) and decrease in the low frequency component (LF) of HRV spectrum by 5.52% (P < 0.05) and a decrease in LF/HF ratio by 19.63% (P < 0.01) in yoga group. In the control group, there was decrease in the HF component and, no significant difference in the LF component of HRV spectrum and LF/HF ratio. The results show that yoga practice decreases sympathetic activity and causes a shift in the autonomic balance towards parasympathetic dominance indicating a reduction in stress. In conclusion, yoga practice helps to reduce stress by optimizing the autonomic functions. So, it is suggested to incorporate yoga module as a regular feature to keep subjunior athletes both mentally and physically fit.

24617124	Effect of yogic intervention on the autonomic nervous system in the patients with coronary artery disease: a randomized controlled trial.	In this study 258 patients from the Department of Cardiology in Chhatrapati Shahuji Maharaj Medical University, Lucknow were selected to participate. All had been diagnosed with coronary artery disease. They were randomly divided into 2 groups, the yoga group and the non-yoga group, 129 in each group; 208 completed the study protocol. The yogic intervention consisted of 35-40 min/day, 5 days a week over a period of 18 months in the Department of Physiology. Autonomic function testing was done in both the groups at zero time and after 18 months. We observed a statistically significant reduction in body mass index, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate (P < 0.05), i.e., a significant positive effect was observed when yoga therapy was used as an adjunct in patients with coronary artery disease.

24615209	Search of novel model for integrative medicine.	This article provides global and Indian scenario with strengths and limitations of present health care system. Affordability, accessibility and availability of health care coupled with disproportionate growth and double burden of diseases have become major concerns in India. This article emphasizes need for mindset change from illness-disease-drug centric curative to person-health-wellness centric preventive and promotive approaches. It highlights innovation deficit faced pharmaceutical industry and drugs being withdrawn from market for safety reasons. Medical pluralism is a growing trend and people are exploring various options including modern, traditional, complementary and alternative medicine. In such a situation, knowledge from Ayurveda, yoga, Chinese medicine and acupuncture may play an important role. We can evolve a suitable model by integrating modern and traditional systems of medicine for affordable health care. In the larger interest of global community, Indian and Chinese systems should share knowledge and experiences for mutual intellectual enrichments and work together to evolve a novel model of integrative medicine.

24596712	Effect of yoga therapy on heart rate, blood pressure and cardiac autonomic function in heart failure.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: It is well known that a hall mark of heart failure is adverse changes in autonomic function. Elevated blood pressure is a powerful predictor of congestive heart failure and other Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) outcomes. In this study, we planned to examine the effects of a 12 week yoga therapy on blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability, and rate pressure product (RPP). METHODS: Out of 130 heart failure patients recruited for the study, 65 patients were randomly selected to receive 12 week yoga therapy along with standard medical therapy (yoga group). Other patients (n=65) received only standard medical therapy (control group). Heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac autonomic function (by short-term heart-rate variability analysis) and myocardial oxygen consumption (by RPP) were assessed before and after 12 weeks. In the yoga group, 44 patients and in the control group, 48 patients completed the study. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in heart rate, blood pressure and RPP in yoga group compared to control group. Also, LFnu and LF-HF ratio decreased significantly and HFnu increased significantly in yoga group compared to control group. CONCLUSION: Twelve-week yoga therapy significantly improved the parasympathetic activity and decreased the sympathetic activity in heart failure patients (NYHA I&II).

24596711	Effect of fast and slow pranayama practice on cognitive functions in healthy volunteers.	OBJECTIVES: To compare the cumulative effect of commonly practised slow and fast pranayama on cognitive functions in healthy volunteers. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: 84 participants who were in self-reported good health, who were in the age group of 18-25 years, who were randomized to fast pranayama, slow pranayama and control group with 28 participants in each group. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fast pranayama included kapalabhati, bhastrika and kukkuriya. Slow pranayama included nadishodhana, Pranav and Savitri. Respective pranayama training was given for 35 minutes, three times per week, for a duration of 12 weeks under the supervision of a certified yoga trainer. Parameters were recorded before and after 12 weeks of intervention: Perceived stress scale (PSS), BMI, waist to hip ratio and cognitive parameters-letter cancellation test, trail making tests A and B, forward and reverse digit spans and auditory and visual reaction times for red light and green light. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Inter-group comparison was done by one way ANOVA and intra-group comparison was done by paired t-test. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Executive functions, PSS and reaction time improved significantly in both fast and slow pranayama groups, except reverse digit span, which showed an improvement only in fast pranayama group. In addition, percentage reduction in reaction time was significantly more in the fast pranayama group as compared to that in slow pranayama group. Both types of pranayamas are beneficial for cognitive functions, but fast pranayama has additional effects on executive function of manipulation in auditory working memory, central neural processing and sensory-motor performance.

24590636	Randomized, controlled trial of yoga in women with breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy.	PURPOSE: Previous research incorporating yoga (YG) into radiotherapy (XRT) for women with breast cancer finds improved quality of life (QOL). However, shortcomings in this research limit the findings. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stages 0 to III breast cancer were recruited before starting XRT and were randomly assigned to YG (n = 53) or stretching (ST; n = 56) three times a week for 6 weeks during XRT or waitlist (WL; n = 54) control. Self-report measures of QOL (Medical Outcomes Study 36-item short-form survey; primary outcomes), fatigue, depression, and sleep quality, and five saliva samples per day for 3 consecutive days were collected at baseline, end of treatment, and 1, 3, and 6 months later. RESULTS: The YG group had significantly greater increases in physical component scale scores compared with the WL group at 1 and 3 months after XRT (P = .01 and P = .01). At 1, 3, and 6 months, the YG group had greater increases in physical functioning compared with both ST and WL groups (P < .05), with ST and WL differences at only 3 months (P < .02). The group differences were similar for general health reports. By the end of XRT, the YG and ST groups also had a reduction in fatigue (P < .05). There were no group differences for mental health and sleep quality. Cortisol slope was steepest for the YG group compared with the ST and WL groups at the end (P = .023 and P = .008) and 1 month after XRT (P = .05 and P = .04). CONCLUSION: YG improved QOL and physiological changes associated with XRT beyond the benefits of simple ST exercises, and these benefits appear to have long-term durability.

24578076	A pilot study of the feasibility and outcomes of yoga for lung cancer survivors.	PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To determine the feasibility of a standardized yoga intervention for survivors of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and, effects on sleep, mood, salivary cortisol levels, and quality of life (QOL). DESIGN: This 14-week, one-group, repeated-measures study included a three-week preintervention phase, eight weeks of yoga classes (40 minutes once per week) and home practice, and a three-week postintervention phase. Follow-up occurred at three and six months poststudy. SETTING: A community-based cancer support center in the midwestern United States. SAMPLE: 7 adults who had completed initial treatment for stages I-IIIa NSCLC. METHODS: A standardized yoga protocol was developed prior to the study by experts in the field. Breathing ease was monitored before, during, and after classes to assess feasibility of movement without compromising respiratory status while doing yoga. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, repeated-measures analysis of variance, and salivary cortisol analysis. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Sleep quality, mood, salivary cortisol, and QOL were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Profile of Mood States-Brief, a cortisol measurement, and the Medical Outcomes Survey SF-36(R), respectively. Breathing ease was assessed using a dyspnea numeric rating scale as well as observation of participants. FINDINGS: Participants with varying stages of disease and length of survivorship were able to perform yoga without respiratory distress. Class attendance exceeded 95%, and all practiced at home. Mood, sleep efficiency, and QOL significantly improved; salivary cortisol levels decreased over time. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga was feasible for NSCLC survivors without further compromising breathing with movement. Potential benefits were identified, supporting the need for future clinical trials with larger samples stratified by cancer stage, treatment, and length of survivorship. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses and healthcare providers should consider yoga as a mind-body practice to manage stress, improve mood and sleep, and potentially enhance QOL for NSCLC survivors.

24575302	The Effect of Community Exercise Interventions for People with MS Who Use Bilateral Support for Gait.	Background. Mobility limitations are a key feature of MS and 25% will require the use of a walking aid 15 years after diagnosis. Few studies have specifically evaluated the effectiveness of physiotherapy and exercise interventions delivered in the community for those with significant disability. Methods. An assessor blind, block randomised, and controlled study recruited participants who required bilateral assistance for gait and who occasionally used wheelchairs for longer distances. They were randomised to 10 weeks of group physiotherapy (balance and strengthening exercises), individual physiotherapy, yoga group, or a control group. Results. Repeated measures ANOVA found significant time effects for physical component of MSIS-29v2 (f = 7.993, P = 0.006) and MFIS (f = 8.695, P = 0.004). The group x time interaction was significant for the BBS (f = 4.391, P = 0.006). Post hoc analysis revealed no difference between group and individual physiotherapy for BBS. There was no significant difference between groups but the 6MWT improved for individual physiotherapy (P = 0.001) and MSIS-29v2 psychological score for group physiotherapy (P = 0.005). Discussion. This study found that balance and strengthening exercises, delivered in the community to those with significant mobility limitations, improve balance. The effect on walking endurance and patient-reported outcomes are unclear and warrants further investigation with a larger control group with similar baseline characteristics to the intervention groups.

24574705	Complementary and alternative medicines in irritable bowel syndrome: an integrative view.	Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder with a high incidence in the general population. The diagnosis of IBS is mainly based on exclusion of other intestinal conditions through the absence of inflammatory markers and specific antigens. The current pharmacological treatment approaches available focus on reducing symptom severity while often limiting quality of life because of significant side effects. This has led to an effectiveness gap for IBS patients that seek further relief to increase their quality of life. Complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) have been associated with a higher degree of symptom management and quality of life in IBS patients. Over the past decade, a number of important clinical trials have shown that specific herbal therapies (peppermint oil and Iberogast((R))), hypnotherapy, cognitive behavior therapy, acupuncture, and yoga present with improved treatment outcomes in IBS patients. We propose an integrative approach to treating the diverse symptoms of IBS by combining the benefits of and need for pharmacotherapy with known CAM therapies to provide IBS patients with the best treatment outcome achievable. Initial steps in this direction are already being considered with an increasing number of practitioners recommending CAM therapies to their patients if pharmacotherapy alone does not alleviate symptoms sufficiently.

24568299	Yoga vs. physical therapy vs. education for chronic low back pain in predominantly minority populations: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain causes substantial morbidity and cost to society while disproportionately impacting low-income and minority adults. Several randomized controlled trials show yoga is an effective treatment. However, the comparative effectiveness of yoga and physical therapy, a common mainstream treatment for chronic low back pain, is unknown. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a randomized controlled trial for 320 predominantly low-income minority adults with chronic low back pain, comparing yoga, physical therapy, and education. Inclusion criteria are adults 18-64 years old with non-specific low back pain lasting >/= 12 weeks and a self-reported average pain intensity of >/= 4 on a 0-10 scale. Recruitment takes place at Boston Medical Center, an urban academic safety-net hospital and seven federally qualified community health centers located in diverse neighborhoods. The 52-week study has an initial 12-week Treatment Phase where participants are randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio into i) a standardized weekly hatha yoga class supplemented by home practice; ii) a standardized evidence-based exercise therapy protocol adapted from the Treatment Based Classification method, individually delivered by a physical therapist and supplemented by home practice; and iii) education delivered through a self-care book. Co-primary outcome measures are 12-week pain intensity measured on an 11-point numerical rating scale and back-specific function measured using the modified Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire. In the subsequent 40-week Maintenance Phase, yoga participants are re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either structured maintenance yoga classes or home practice only. Physical therapy participants are similarly re-randomized to either five booster sessions or home practice only. Education participants continue to follow recommendations of educational materials. We will also assess cost effectiveness from the perspectives of the individual, insurers, and society using claims databases, electronic medical records, self-report cost data, and study records. Qualitative data from interviews will add subjective detail to complement quantitative data. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov, with the ID number: NCT01343927.

24568209	The effect of chair yoga in older adults with moderate and severe Alzheimer's disease.	Using a quasi-experimental single-group design, this study examined the feasibility of older adults with Alzheimer's disease (AD)-type dementia to complete the Sit 'N' Fit Chair Yoga Program. Physical function of participants who completed the program was measured. The nine older adults with AD (mean age = 83) participated in the 8-week Sit 'N' Fit Chair Yoga Program. To measure physical function, the Six-Minute Walk Test, the Gait Speed Test, and the Berg Balance Scale were administered at pre-intervention, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 1 month after program completion. All participants completed the program. Positive changes were seen across all physical measures. Further study, using a larger sample and including a control group, is needed to fully determine the effect of the Sit 'N' Fit Chair Yoga Program on older adults with moderate to severe AD.

24559828	Self-prescribed complementary and alternative medicine use for back pain amongst a range of care options: results from a nationally representative sample of 1310 women aged 60-65 years.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence and characteristics of women who self-prescribe complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for back pain. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of a nationally-representative sample of women aged 60-65 years from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH). RESULTS: A significant number of women (75.2%, n=985) self-prescribed one or more CAM for back pain in the previous twelve months. Use of self-prescribed CAM for back pain was not associated with socio-economic status. The most common self-prescribed CAM used by women was supplements (n=776, 59.2%), vitamins/minerals (n=592, 45.2%), yoga/meditation (n=187, 14.3%), herbal medicines (n=172, 13.1%) and aromatherapy oils (n=112, 8.6%). Women who visited general practitioners (GPs) more than three times in the previous twelve months were 1.59 times (95% CI: 1.14, 2.22) more likely to self-prescribe CAM for back pain than those women who did not visit GPs. Women who visited a pharmacist three or more times in the previous twelve months were 2.90 times (95% CI: 1.65, 5.09) more likely to self-prescribe CAM for back pain than those women who did not visit a pharmacist. CONCLUSION: This study identifies substantial use of self-prescribed CAM by women for back pain regardless of their education, income or urban/rural residency. In order to ensure safe, effective practice it is important that all providing and managing health services for back pain sufferers remain mindful of patients' possible use of self-prescribed CAM.

24559823	The use of complementary and alternative medicine by women transitioning through menopause in Germany: results of a survey of women aged 45-60 years.	OBJECTIVES: To describe prevalence rates of complementary and alternative medicine therapies (CAM) for the relief of menopausal complaints among German women. Furthermore, to investigate the perceived effectiveness of these therapies. DESIGN: A self-administered questionnaire was sent to 9785 randomly selected women in Germany aged between 45 and 60 years. RESULTS: A total of 1893 (19.3%) questionnaires have been sent back. The mean age of all participants was 52.6+/-4.3 years. 81% (n=1517) of the responding women stated that they had experienced menopausal complaints at least once. Symptoms ranged from vasomotor symptoms, including hot flushes and night sweats, in 71.2% of cases, to bladder problems in 42.7%. The average symptom score (MRS II total score, range 1-44) among the respondents was 12.76+/-9.6. More than half (56%; n=1049/1872) of the responding women had used some form of therapy to alleviate their symptoms at least once. The majority of women undertaking a therapy (64.8%; n=679/1049) had used only CAM interventions (either one or more type of CAM), 14.2% (n=149) had used hormone replacement therapy (HRT) only, while 21.1% (n=221/1049) had tried both CAM and HRT. Popular CAM interventions by the respondents were an alteration of lifestyle (28.7%), St. John's wort (18.3%) and homoeopathy (14.9%). An alteration in lifestyle was rated as the most effective CAM treatment with 84.9% (n=457). Other treatments like hormone yoga (79.2%; n=42), homoeopathy (73.7%; n=205) and TCM (59.1%; n=94) were also perceived to be effective. Phytoestrogens were rated as the most ineffective (45.5%; n=50). CONCLUSION: CAM interventions to alleviate menopausal complaints are popular among German women, with 48.2% (n=900/1872) of respondents reporting having used CAM either alone or in combination with HRT. However, the users rated the effects of CAM differently, with some reporting CAM to be highly effective, while others indicate lower effectiveness. Nevertheless, women with a significantly higher symptom scoring tend to use both CAM and a conventional therapy (HRT).	Buhling, K J;Daniels, B V;Studnitz, F S G V;Eulenburg, C;Mueck, A O	2014 Feb

24554958	The effect of laughter Yoga on general health among nursing students.	BACKGROUND: Promotion and provision of individuals' health is one of the bases for development in societies. Students' mental health is very important in each society. Students of medical sciences universities, especially nursing students, are under various stresses in clinical environment, in addition to the stress they experience in theoretical education environment. With regard to the importance of nursing students' general health and considering the various existing strategies to promote general health components, use of complementary treatments is more considered because of their better public acceptance, low costs, and fewer complications. One of the new strategies in this regard is laughter Yoga. The present study was conducted with an aim to define the effect of laughter Yoga on general health among nursing students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a quasi-experimental two-group three-step study conducted on 38 male nursing students in the nursing and midwifery school of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in 2012. In the study group, eight 1 h sessions of laughter Yoga were held (two sessions a week), and in the control group, no intervention was conducted. The data of the present study were collected by Goldberg and Hiller's General Health Questionnaire and analyzed by SPSS version 12. RESULTS: The findings showed a significant difference in the mean scores of general health before and after laughter Yoga intervention in the two groups of study and control. CONCLUSIONS: The findings showed that laughter Yoga had a positive effect on students' general health and improved the signs of physical and sleep disorders, lowered anxiety and depression, and promoted their social function. Therefore, laughter Yoga can be used as one of the effective strategies on students' general health.	Yazdani, Mohsen;Esmaeilzadeh, Mojtaba;Pahlavanzadeh, Saeid;Khaledi, Firouz	2014 Jan

24550962	Shoulder injury incidence and severity through identification of risk factors in rugby union players.	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze shoulder injury incidence and severity to reduce players' risk of sustaining injuries and missing playing time. METHODS: Ninety-five South African Premier team rugby Union players (mean: 25 years of age) took part in the study with injury data collected through the use of injury reports. RESULTS: This study found that approximately two of every five participants sampled incurred a primary shoulder injury with dislocation being the most prevalent. Twenty-one (80.8%) of the participants that experienced a primary shoulder injury also sustained a secondary shoulder injury with rotator cuff tears being most predominant. Only three players were found to have suffered tertiary shoulder injuries. The injuries were mainly related to tackling during training and matches. Twenty players were found to have adhered to a strength and conditioning program prior to their injuries and 14 of the injured participants received or adhered to a prehabilitation program. Eight of the injured players also suffered from recurrent injuries with dislocations being the most common. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS indicated that specific positions in rugby are at higher risk of shoulder injuries than others and that with the correct preventive measures put in place, the severity of injuries can be reduced.

24534390	Is exercise effective for the management of neck pain and associated disorders or whiplash-associated disorders? A systematic review by the Ontario Protocol for Traffic Injury Management (OPTIMa) Collaboration.	BACKGROUND CONTEXT: In 2008, the Neck Pain Task Force (NPTF) recommended exercise for the management of neck pain and whiplash-associated disorders (WAD). However, no evidence was available on the effectiveness of exercise for Grade III neck pain or WAD. Moreover, limited evidence was available to contrast the effectiveness of various types of exercises. PURPOSE: To update the findings of the NPTF on the effectiveness of exercise for the management of neck pain and WAD grades I to III. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Systematic review and best evidence synthesis. SAMPLE: Studies comparing the effectiveness of exercise to other conservative interventions or no intervention. OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes of interest included self-rated recovery, functional recovery, pain intensity, health-related quality of life, psychological outcomes, and/or adverse events. METHODS: We searched eight electronic databases from 2000 to 2013. Eligible studies were critically appraised using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network criteria. The results of scientifically admissible studies were synthesized following best-evidence synthesis principles. RESULTS: We retrieved 4,761 articles, and 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were critically appraised. Ten RCTs were scientifically admissible: nine investigated neck pain and one addressed WAD. For the management of recent neck pain Grade I/II, unsupervised range-of-motion exercises, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and acetaminophen, or manual therapy lead to similar outcomes. For recent neck pain Grade III, supervised graded strengthening is more effective than advice but leads to similar short-term outcomes as a cervical collar. For persistent neck pain and WAD Grade I/II, supervised qigong and combined strengthening, range-of-motion, and flexibility exercises are more effective than wait list. Additionally, supervised Iyengar yoga is more effective than home exercise. Finally, supervised high-dose strengthening is not superior to home exercises or advice. CONCLUSIONS: We found evidence that supervised qigong, Iyengar yoga, and combined programs including strengthening, range of motion, and flexibility are effective for the management of persistent neck pain. We did not find evidence that one supervised exercise program is superior to another. Overall, most studies reported small effect sizes suggesting that a small clinical effect can be expected with the use of exercise alone.

24531385	Personality, cognitive styles and Morningness-Eveningness disposition in a sample of Yoga trainees.	BACKGROUND: Yoga is a psychophysical, spiritual science of holistic living, aiming towards body and mind development; it can influence well-being, cognitive processes, personality (Gunas), psychophysiological parameters, and human health. Since it has been observed that Morningness-Eveningness disposition is associated with personality, and that personality can characterize people practicing Yoga, in this exploratory study we posited that Morningness-Eveningness might be associated with personality in Yoga trainees. Since Yoga can have influences over cognitive perspectives, and since it has been observed that Morningness-Eveningness disposition can associate with cognitive processes, we investigated a sample of Yoga trainees with reference to relationship with styles of learning and thinking (relevant aspects of cognitive functioning) and also with Morningness-Eveningness disposition. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We tested 184 Yoga trainees using the following questionnaires: Styles of Learning and Thinking (Torrance), Big Five Questionnaire (Caprara, Barbaranelli, Borgogni), and reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (Natale). RESULTS: We found that Morning types score significantly higher than Evening types on Conscientiousness, Friendliness, Scrupulousness, Openness to Culture, emotional Stability, emotion Control, they score higher than intermediate types on Conscientiousness, Friendliness, Scrupulousness. Moreover, data showed that the high majority of subjects, also with reference to Morningness-Eveningness disposition, have right-sided styles of learning and thinking, pointing out a tendency towards right-sided cognitive precessing in the whole sample. Personality traits of the Yoga trainees were also investigated. CONCLUSIONS: Data are discussed with reference to existing literature, psychological and neuroscientific perspectives are suggested, previous studies about Yoga published on Medical Science Monitor are also considered.

24530169	Compliance effects in a randomised controlled trial of yoga for chronic low back pain: a methodological study.	STUDY DESIGN: Methodological study nested within a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) of yoga plus usual general practitioner (GP) care vs usual GP care for chronic low back pain. OBJECTIVE: To explore the treatment effects of non-compliance using three approaches in an RCT evaluating yoga for low back pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A large multicentre RCT using intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis found that participants with chronic low back pain who were offered a 12-week progressive programme of yoga plus usual GP care had better back function than those offered usual GP care alone. However, ITT analysis can underestimate the effect of treatment in those who comply with treatment. As such, the data were analysed using other approaches to assess the problem of non-compliance. The main outcome measure was the self-reported Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). METHODS: Complier average causal effect (CACE) analysis, per-protocol analysis and on-treatment analysis were conducted on the data of participants who were fully compliant, predefined as attendance of at least three of the first six sessions and at least three other sessions. The analysis was repeated for participants who had attended at least one yoga session (i.e. any compliance), which included participants who were fully compliant. Each approach was described, including strengths and weaknesses, and the results of the different approaches were compared with those of the ITT analysis. RESULTS: For the participants who were fully compliant (n=93, 60%), a larger beneficial treatment effect was seen using CACE analysis compared with per-protocol, on-treatment and ITT analyses at 3 and 12 months. The difference in mean change in RMDQ score between randomised groups was -3.30 [95% confidence interval (CI) -4.90 to -1.70, P<0.001] at 3 months and -2.23 (95% CI -3.93 to -0.53, P=0.010) at 12 months for CACE analysis, -3.12 (95% CI -4.26 to -1.98, P<0.001) at 3 months and -2.11 (95% CI -3.33 to -0.89, P=0.001) at 12 months for per-protocol analysis, and -2.91 (95% CI -4.06 to -1.76, P<0.001) at 3 months and -2.10 (95% CI -3.31 to -0.89, P=0.001) at 12 months for on-treatment analysis. For the participants who demonstrated any compliance (n=133, 85%), the results were generally consistent with the fully compliant group at 3 months, but the treatment effect was smaller. The difference in mean change in RMDQ score between randomised groups was -2.45 (95% CI -3.67 to -1.24) for CACE analysis, -2.30 (95% CI -3.43 to 1.17) for per-protocol analysis and -2.15 (95% CI -3.25 to -1.06) for on-treatment analysis, which was slightly less than that for ITT analysis. In contrast, at 12 months, per-protocol and on-treatment analyses showed a larger treatment effect compared with CACE and ITT analyses: per protocol analysis -1.86 (95% CI -3.02 to -0.71), on-treatment analysis -1.99 (95% CI -3.13 to -0.86) and CACE analysis -1.67 (95% CI -2.95 to -0.40). CONCLUSION: ITT analysis estimated a slightly smaller treatment effect in participants who complied with treatment. When examining compliance, CACE analysis is more rigorous than per-protocol and on-treatment analyses. Using CACE analysis, the treatment effect was larger in participants who complied with treatment compared with participants who were allocated to treatment, and the difference between ITT and CACE analyses for the fully compliant group at 3 months was small but clinically important. Per-protocol and on-treatment analyses may produce unreliable estimates when the effect of treatment is small. INTERNATIONAL STANDARD RANDOMISED TRIAL NUMBER REGISTER: ISRCTN 81079604.

24528618	Review of complementary and alternative medical treatment of arrhythmias.	Complementary and alternative medical (CAM) therapies are commonly used by patients for the treatment of medical conditions spanning the full spectrum of severity and chronicity. The use of alternative remedies, both herbal and others, for conditions lacking effective medical treatment, is on the increase. Included within this categorization, arrhythmic disease-absent effective catheter-based therapy or with medical therapy limited by the toxicities of contemporary antiarrhythmic agents is frequently managed by patients with CAM therapies without their practitioner's knowledge and in the face of potential herb-drug toxicities. This study reviews 9 CAM therapies: 7 individual herbal therapies along with acupuncture and yoga that have been studied and reported as having an antiarrhythmic effect. The primary focuses are the proposed antiarrhythmic mechanism of each CAM agent along with interactions between the CAM therapies and commonly prescribed medical therapy for arrhythmia patients. We stress persistent vigilance on the part of the provider in discussing the use of herbal or other CAM agents within the arrhythmia population.	Brenyo, Andrew;Aktas, Mehmet K	2014 Mar 1
24525556	Physiotherapeutic scoliosis-specific exercises for adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis.	The use of exercises for the treatment of Adolescents with Idiopathic Scoliosis is controversial. Whilst exercises are routinely used in a number of central and southern European countries, most centres in the rest of the world (mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries), do not advocate its use. One of the reasons for this is that many health care professionals are usually not conversant with the differences between generalised physiotherapy exercises and physiotherapeutic scoliosis-specific exercises (PSSE): while the former are generic exercises usually consisting of low-impact stretching and strengthening activities like yoga, Pilates and the Alexander technique, PSSE consist of a program of curve-specific exercise protocols which are individually adapted to a patients' curve site, magnitude and clinical characteristics. PSSEs are performed with the therapeutic aim of reducing the deformity and preventing its progression. It also aims to stabilise the improvements achieved with the ultimate goal of limiting the need for corrective braces or the necessity of surgery. This paper introduces the different 'Schools' and approaches of PSSE currently practiced (Scientific Exercise Approach to Scoliosis - SEAS, Schroth, Barcelona Scoliosis Physical Therapy School - BSPTS, Dobomed, Side Shift, Functional Individual Therapy of Scoliosis - FITS and Lyon) and discusses their commonalities and differences.

24519347	[Systematic review of yoga for depression and quality of sleep in the elderly].	BACKGROUND: Aging and age-related health problems are major issues of concern for community health services. Yoga is an exercise with both physiological and psychological effects on aging. Although many studies have assessed the effectiveness of yoga in the elderly, little information is available in the literature to support empirical conclusions. PURPOSE: This review synthesizes and characterizes findings related to the effects of yoga on depression and quality of sleep in the elderly. METHODS: Researchers used keywords including yoga, elderly, aged / older adult, depression, sleep, and quality to search 6 electronic databases for relevant studies published prior to March 2013. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to screen identified study abstracts. The Jadad scale appraised the quality of identified studies. RESULTS: Seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Five studies found significant changes in participant depression symptoms after doing yoga. Three studies found significant effects on the quality of sleep of participants after 6 months of doing yoga. CONCLUSION: Yoga significantly reduced the depressive symptoms of elderly participants and improved their quality of sleep after 6 months. Findings were similar for elderly living in institutions and in the community. However, the majority of participants in the assessed studies were women characterized by a high level of social participation and proactive participation in health promotion activities. Future studies should broaden the scope of research to address different aging populations and use long-term cohort observations in order to better elicit the effectiveness of yoga and to develop strategies to introduce yoga into daily activities.

24517304	A systematic review of yoga for balance in a healthy population.	OBJECTIVE: A systematic review was done of the evidence on yoga for improving balance. DESIGN: Relevant articles and reviews were identified in major databases (PubMed, MEDLINE((R)), IndMed, Web of Knowledge, EMBASE, EBSCO, Science Direct, and Google Scholar), and their reference lists searched. Key search words were yoga, balance, proprioception, falling, fear of falling, and falls. Included studies were peer-reviewed articles published in English before June 2012, using healthy populations. All yoga styles and study designs were included. Two (2) raters individually rated study quality using the Downs & Black (DB) checklist. Final scores were achieved by consensus. Achievable scores ranged from 0 to 27. Effect size (ES) was calculated where possible. RESULTS: Fifteen (15) of 152 studies (age range 10-93, n=688) met the inclusion criteria: 5 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 4 quasi-experimental, 2 cross-sectional, and 4 single-group designs. DB scores ranged from 10 to 24 (RCTs), 14-19 (quasi-experimental), 6-12 (cross-sectional), and 11-20 (single group). Studies varied by yoga style, frequency of practice, and duration. Eleven (11) studies found positive results (p<0.05) on at least one balance outcome. ES ranged from -0.765 to 2.71 (for 8 studies) and was not associated with DB score. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga may have a beneficial effect on balance, but variable study design and poor reporting quality obscure the results. Balance as an outcome is underutilized, and more probing measures are needed.	Jeter, Pamela E;Nkodo, Amelie-Francoise;Moonaz, Steffany Haaz;Dagnelie, Gislin	2014 Apr
24513347	Inter-operator variability of electrodermal measure at Jing Well points using AcuGraph 3.	Recent studies have found that many factors, both biological and operator induced, influence electrodermal measurements. Here, we report on operator variability for a series of measurements made by four operators at Jing-Well points on 132 individuals of both sexes (68 males and 64 females) by using the AcuGraph 3 'Digital Meridian Imaging Tool': Operator 1 (16 males, 12 females), Operator 2 (18 males, 13 females), Operator 3 (15 males, 21 females), and Operator 4 (19 males, 18 females). The individuals studied were attending a yoga therapy program for type 2 diabetes mellitus and were assessed on the 1st day of treatment. Large inter-operator variations in overall acumeridian energy readings were observed. For individual meridians, the AcuGraph 3 measure differed by up to 42 points for minimum values and 67 points for maximum values. After normalization, the data showed similar patterns between different acumeridians. This suggested that variations were caused by operators applying different pressures when making measurements. Thus, inter-operator variability should be considered when interpreting electrodermal measurements made by several different operators. Unless inter-operator variability is taken into account, actual values may not have meaning; only then can readings for the same population taken by different operators be evaluated correctly.

24512627	Healthcare professional views and experiences of complementary and alternative therapies in obstetric practice in North East Scotland: a prospective questionnaire survey.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) therapy by UK healthcare professionals involved in the care of pregnant women, and to identify key predictors of use. DESIGN: A prospective survey. SETTING: Maternity services in Grampian, North East Scotland. SAMPLE: All healthcare professionals (135) involved in the care of pregnant women (midwives, obstetricians, anaesthetists). METHODS: Questionnaire development, piloting, and distribution. Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis. RESULTS: A response rate of 87% was achieved. A third of respondents (32.5%) had recommended (prescribed, referred, or advised) the use of CAMs to pregnant women. The most frequently recommended CAMs modalities were: vitamins and minerals (excluding folic acid) (55%); massage (53%); homeopathy (50%); acupuncture (32%); yoga (32%); reflexology (26%); aromatherapy (24%); and herbal medicine (21%). Although univariate analysis identified that those who recommended CAMs were significantly more likely to be midwives who had been in post for more than 5 years, had received training in CAMs, were interested in CAMs, and were themselves users of CAMs, the only variable retained in bivariate logistic regression was 'personal use of CAM', with an odds ratio of 8.26 (95% CI 3.09-22.05; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Despite the lack of safety or efficacy data, a wide variety of CAM therapies are recommended to pregnant women by approximately a third of healthcare professionals, with those recommending the use of CAMs being eight times more likely to be personal CAM users.

24512477	How mindfulness changed my sleep: focus groups with chronic insomnia patients.	BACKGROUND: Chronic insomnia is a major public health problem affecting approximately 10% of adults. Use of meditation and yoga to develop mindful awareness ('mindfulness training') may be an effective approach to treat chronic insomnia, with sleep outcomes comparable to nightly use of prescription sedatives, but more durable and with minimal or no side effects. The purpose of this study was to understand mindfulness training as experienced by patients with chronic insomnia, and suggest procedures that may be useful in optimizing sleep benefits. METHODS: Adults (N = 18) who completed an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program as part of a randomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate MBSR as a treatment for chronic insomnia were invited to participate in post-trial focus groups. Two groups were held. Participants (n = 9) described how their sleep routine, thoughts and emotions were affected by MBSR and about utility (or not) of various mindfulness techniques. Groups were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: Four themes were identified: the impact of mindfulness on sleep and motivation to adopt a healthy sleep lifestyle; benefits of mindfulness on aspects of life beyond sleep; challenges and successes in adopting mindfulness-based practices; and the importance of group sharing and support. Participants said they were not sleeping more, but sleeping better, waking more refreshed, feeling less distressed about insomnia, and better able to cope when it occurred. Some participants experienced the course as a call to action, and for them, practicing meditation and following sleep hygiene guidelines became priorities. Motivation to sustain behavioral changes was reinforced by feeling physically better and more emotionally stable, and seeing others in the MBSR class improve. The body scan was identified as an effective tool to enable falling asleep faster. Participants described needing to continue practicing mindfulness to maintain benefits. CONCLUSIONS: First-person accounts are consistent with published trial results of positive impacts of MBSR on sleep measured by sleep diary, actigraphy, and self-report sleep scales. Findings indicate that mindfulness training in a group format, combined with sleep hygiene education, is important for effective application of MBSR as a treatment for chronic insomnia.

24509107	Angelina's choice: private decision, public impact.	The decision of the actress, Angelina Jolie (AJ), to undergo preventive risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy has elicited extreme responses, in support and against. We will discuss whether her decision was justified and if there are other options available to women. AJ, who is 38 years old, inherited the BRCA 1 gene. Because of the lack of randomised trials, there is controversy about the overall benefit that various risk-reduction strategies offer carriers of the BRCA 1, but some of the strategies offer a clear benefit. The decision to opt for mastectomy must be driven by the patient's choice, evidence on the balance of the risks and benefits, the quality of life after surgery and issues relating to body image.

24501521	Efficacy of Yoga for sustained attention in university students.	Sustained attention (SA) is a vital function mediated by the right frontal - parietal cortex. The digit vigilance test (DVT) measures SA. Assessment of SA in students for their academic excellence is considered to be an essential part of a neuropsychological evaluation. The objective of this study is to determine SA in students undergoing training of integrated Yoga module (IYM). A total of 66 university students aged between 18-37 years participated in this study with a single group pre-post design. The DVT data was collected before and after the IYM. Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 19 was used for data analysis. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showed that the data were not normally distributed. The Wilcoxon's signed ranks test was used to compare means of data. The data analysis showed 11.66% decrease (P < 0.001) in total time taken for DVT and 31.90% decrease (P < 0.001) in error scores for DVT. The present study suggests that IYM can result in improvement of SA among students, thus paving the way for their academic excellence. Additional well-designed studies are needed before a strong recommendation can be made.	Sheela;Nagendra, Hongasandra Rama Rao;Ganpat, Tikhe Sham	2013 Jul
24491402	A systematic review of yoga for heart disease.	BACKGROUND: This systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed to evaluate the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendation for yoga as an ancillary intervention for heart disease. METHODS: Medline/PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and IndMED were searched up to October 2013. Main outcome measures were mortality, nonfatal cardiac events, exercise capacity, health-related quality of life, and modifiable cardiac risk factors. Risk of bias, quality of evidence, and the strength of the recommendation for or against yoga were assessed according to the Cochrane Collaboration and GRADE recommendations. RESULTS: Seven RCTs with 624 patients comparing yoga to usual care were included. For coronary heart disease (four RCTs), there was very low evidence for no effect on mortality, for a reduced number of angina episodes, and for increased exercise capacity, and low evidence for reduced modifiable cardiac risk factors. For heart failure (two RCTs), there was very low evidence for no effect on mortality, and low evidence for increased exercise capacity, and for no effect on health-related quality of life. For cardiac dysrhythmias treated with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (one RCT), there was very low evidence for no effect on mortality, and for improved quality, and low evidence for effects on nonfatal device-treated ventricular events. Three RCTs reported safety data and reported that no adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this review, weak recommendations can be made for the ancillary use of yoga for patients with coronary heart disease, heart failure, and cardiac dysrhythmia at this point.

24481577	Use of complementary and alternative medicine by a sample of Turkish primary headache patients.	OBJECTIVE: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is increasingly being used as adjunctive treatment in primary headache syndromes in many countries. In the Turkish population, no epidemiologic data have been reported about awareness and usage of these treatments in patients with headache. METHODS: One hundred and ten primary headache patients attending three headache clinics completed a questionnaire regarding their headaches, the known modalities and the use and effect of CAM procedures for their headaches. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 34.7+/-9.6 years (32.8-36.5). Almost two-thirds of patients had completed high school and university, and one-third of patients were housewives. Migraine without aura (45.5%) was the most frequently diagnosed type of headache followed by migraine with aura (19.1%) and tension-type headache (18.2%). In 43.6% of the patients, headache frequency was 5-10 per month. The most frequently known CAM modalities were massage (74.5%), acupuncture (44.5%), yoga (31.8%), exercise (28.2%), psychotherapy (25.5%), and rosemary (23.6%). The most frequently used CAM treatments were massage (51%) and exercise (11%). Only massage was reported to be beneficial in one-third of the primary headache patients; the other modalities were not. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the subgroup of primary headache patients in Turkey seek and use alternative treatments, frequently in combination with standard treatments. Neurologists should become more knowledgeable regarding CAM therapies; further randomized and controlled clinical researches with large sample sizes are needed.

26770079	Pranayam for Treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Results From a Randomized, Controlled Trial.	CONTEXT: Existing medications for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) do not modify the long-term decline in lung functions. The increasing prevalence of COPD requires the development of interventions beyond the usual medical treatment, with a specific focus on rehabilitation. Controlled breathing (pranayam) is a specific set of respiratory exercises within yoga that has been shown to improve the resting respiratory rate, vital capacity, maximum voluntary ventilation, breath-holding time, and maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures. OBJECTIVE: In this study, pranayam was analyzed as an adjunct treatment for medically stable individuals with moderate to severe COPD. DESIGN: The research team carried out a case control study. SETTING: This study took place at a tertiary care institution, with the participation of the departments of Physiology, Yoga and Naturopathy, and Pulmonary Medicine at Pandit Bhagwat Dayal Sharma Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Rohtak, Haryana, India. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 50 medically stable individuals with moderate to severe COPD. INTERVENTION: Twenty-five participants in the intervention arm (IA) were trained to practice pranayam for 30 min 2 x/d and also received the usual medical treatment. The control group also included 25 participants, and they received the usual medical treatment only, without pranayam. OUTCOME MEASURES: The COPD assessment test (CAT) score and the body-mass index, obstruction, dyspnea, exercise (BODE) capacity index were assessed at baseline and at 3 mo. The results were expressed using standard statistical methods. RESULTS: For the IA, a significant improvement occurred in the CAT score (21.2 +/- 2.6-17.4 +/- 2.5, P < .001) and in the impact level, which moved from high (>20) to medium (10-20) after 3 mo of practicing pranayam. The control arm (CA) showed no significant improvement in the CAT score (21.6 +/- 2.7-21.4 +/- 2.7). Although the IA showed a significant improvement in a 6-min walk test (6MWT) when compared to the CA, (1) the IA's forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1), which is a measure of airflow that is commonly impaired in COPD patients and which is associated with poor functional status, showed no significant improvements, and (2) the IA's BODE capacity index showed no significant improvements. CONCLUSION: The current study shows that pranayam has been demonstrated as useful for individuals with moderate to severe COPD. Significant improvements in the IA's CAT scores after 3 mo of practice suggests that pranayam can improve the subjective experience of health, disease severity, and functional status for COPD patients, without much improvement in FEV1 actually occurring and with airflow limitation not fully reversible but usually progressive. The research team concluded that pranayam is a useful adjunct treatment and can be an effective rehabilitation program for individuals with COPD.

24473534	Pilot study of integral yoga for menopausal hot flashes.	OBJECTIVE: This study aims to obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of yoga for reducing self-reported menopausal hot flashes in a randomized study including an attention control group. METHODS: We randomized 54 late perimenopausal women (2-12 mo of amenorrhea) and postmenopausal women (>12 mo of amenorrhea)--aged 45 to 58 years and who experienced at least four hot flashes per day, on average, for at least 4 weeks--to one of three groups: yoga, health and wellness education (HW), and wait list (WL). Yoga and HW classes consisted of weekly 90-minute classes for 10 weeks. All women completed daily hot flash diaries throughout the trial (10 wk) to track the frequency and severity of hot flashes. The mean hot flash index score is based on the number of mild, moderate, severe, and very severe hot flashes. RESULTS: Hot flash frequency declined significantly across time for all three groups, with the strongest decline occurring during the first week. There was no overall significant difference in hot flash frequency decrease over time by treatment groups, but the yoga and HW groups followed similar patterns and showed greater decreases than the WL group. On week 10, women in the yoga group reported an approximately 66% decrease in hot flash frequency, women in the HW group reported a 63% decrease, and women in the WL group reported a 36% decrease. The hot flash index showed a similar pattern. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that yoga can serve as a behavioral option for reducing hot flashes but may not offer any advantage over other types of interventions.

24470004	Yoga's impact on inflammation, mood, and fatigue in breast cancer survivors: a randomized controlled trial.	PURPOSE: To evaluate yoga's impact on inflammation, mood, and fatigue. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A randomized controlled 3-month trial was conducted with two post-treatment assessments of 200 breast cancer survivors assigned to either 12 weeks of 90-minute twice per week hatha yoga classes or a wait-list control. The main outcome measures were lipopolysaccharide-stimulated production of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and scores on the Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory-Short Form (MFSI-SF), the vitality scale from the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form (SF-36), and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale. RESULTS: Immediately post-treatment, fatigue was not lower (P > .05) but vitality was higher (P = .01) in the yoga group compared with the control group. At 3 months post-treatment, fatigue was lower in the yoga group (P = .002), vitality was higher (P = .01), and IL-6 (P = .027), TNF-alpha (P = .027), and IL-1beta (P = .037) were lower for yoga participants compared with the control group. Groups did not differ on depression at either time (P > .2). Planned secondary analyses showed that the frequency of yoga practice had stronger associations with fatigue at both post-treatment visits (P = .019; P < .001), as well as vitality (P = .016; P = .0045), but not depression (P > .05) than simple group assignment; more frequent practice produced larger changes. At 3 months post-treatment, increasing yoga practice also led to a decrease in IL-6 (P = .01) and IL-1beta (P = .03) production but not in TNF-alpha production (P > .05). CONCLUSION: Chronic inflammation may fuel declines in physical function leading to frailty and disability. If yoga dampens or limits both fatigue and inflammation, then regular practice could have substantial health benefits.

24467450	Laughter and humor therapy in dialysis.	Laughter and humor therapy have been used in health care to achieve physiological and psychological health-related benefits. The application of these therapies to the dialysis context remains unclear. This paper reviews the evidence related to laughter and humor therapy as a medical therapy relevant to the dialysis patient population. Studies from other groups such as children, the elderly, and persons with mental health, cancer, and other chronic conditions are included to inform potential applications of laughter therapy to the dialysis population. Therapeutic interventions could range from humorous videos, stories, laughter clowns through to raucous simulated laughter and Laughter Yoga. The effect of laughter and humor on depression, anxiety, pain, immunity, fatigue, sleep quality, respiratory function and blood glucose may have applications to the dialysis context and require further research.

24464106	Yoga and meditation in cardiovascular disease.	Yoga is a holistic mind-body intervention aimed at physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well being. Several studies have shown that yoga and/or meditation can control risk factors for cardiovascular disease like hypertension, type II diabetes and insulin resistance, obesity, lipid profile, psychosocial stress and smoking. Some randomized studies suggest that yoga/meditation could retard or even regress early and advanced coronary atherosclerosis. A recent study suggests that transcendental meditation may be extremely useful in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease and may reduce cardiovascular events by 48% over a 5-year period. Another small study suggests that yoga may be helpful in prevention of atrial fibrillation. However, most studies have several limitations like lack of adequate controls, small sample size, inconsistencies in baseline and different methodologies, etc. and therefore large trials with improved methodologies are required to confirm these findings. However, in view of the existing knowledge and yoga being a cost-effective technique without side effects, it appears appropriate to incorporate yoga/meditation for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

24460709	Cognitive interviews guide design of a new CAM patient expectations questionnaire.	BACKGROUND: No consistent relationship exists between pre-treatment expectations and therapeutic benefit from various complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies in clinical trials. However, many different expectancy measures have been used in those studies, with no validated questionnaires clearly focused on CAM and pain. We undertook cognitive interviews as part of a process to develop and validate such a questionnaire. METHODS: We reviewed questions about expectations of benefits of acupuncture, chiropractic, massage, or yoga for pain. Components of the questions - verbs, nouns, response options, terms and phrases describing back pain - were identified. Using seven different cognitive interview scripts, we conducted 39 interviews to evaluate how individuals with chronic low back pain understood these individual components in the context of expectancy questions for a therapy they had not yet received. Chosen items were those with the greatest agreement and least confusion among participants, and were closest to the meanings intended by the investigators. RESULTS: The questionnaire drafted for psychometric evaluation had 18 items covering various domains of expectancy. "Back pain" was the most consistently interpreted descriptor for this condition. The most understandable response options were 0-10 scales, a structure used throughout the questionnaire, with 0 always indicating no change, and 10 anchored with an absolute descriptor such as "complete relief". The use of words to describe midpoints was found to be confusing. The word "expect" held different and shifting meanings for participants. Thus paired items comparing "hope" and "realistically expect" were chosen to evaluate 5 different aspects of treatment expectations (back pain; back dysfunction and global effects; impact of back pain on specific areas of life; sleep, mood, and energy; coping). "Impact of back pain" on various areas of life was found to be a consistently meaningful concept, and more global than "interference". CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive interviews identified wordings with considerable agreement among both participants and investigators. Some items widely used in clinical studies had different meanings to participants than investigators, or were confusing to participants. The final 18-item questionnaire is undergoing psychometric evaluation with goals of streamlining as well as identifying best items for use when questionnaire length is constrained.

24459305	Efficacy of yoga for mental performance in university students.	BACKGROUND: With growing scientific evidence, yoga is emerging as an important health behavior-lifestyle modifying module to achieve holistic health at physical, mental, emotional, social and spiritual levels. Brain wave coherence (BWC) recordings from the surface of the skull are associated with different cognitive processes and plays both critical and useful roles in yoga with wide range of functional significance. The psycho-physiological changes that characterize the efficacy of yoga for better mental performance in university students have not been studied adequately. OBJECTIVE: The study was designed to assess the mental performance through BWC analysis in university students undergoing Integrated Yoga Module (IYM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The IYM subjects (n=30) with 25.77+/-4.85 years of mean age participated in this single group pre-post study. The BWC data was collected before (pre) and after (post) the 21 days IYM using Brain Master (Model: 2E Part # 390-001), Michigan, USA. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Means, standard deviations, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Wilcoxon signed rank test were used for analyzing data with the help of SPSS-16. RESULTS: A complete statistical and spectral analysis showed 43.24% increase (P<0.001) in Delta, 9.13% increase (P=0.289) in Theta, 57.85% increase (P<0.001) in Alpha, 17.65% decrease (P=0.136) in Beta and 9.19% increase (P=0.586) in Gamma BWC between pre and post intervention measurements. CONCLUSION: BWC study showed significant increase in both Delta and Alpha wave coherence suggesting that IYM can result in improvement of coherent and integrated brain functioning among students, thus paving the way for their better mental performance. Although this preliminary research is promising, more well-designed studies are needed before a strong recommendation can be made.	Ganpat, Tikhe Sham;Nagendra, Hongasandra Ramarao;Selvi, V	2013 Oct
24455660	Angelina's choice.	This is an opinion piece on how a celebrity's personal choice to undergo prophylactic mastectomy on discovery of an aberrant gene, when publicly promoted, carries in itself the power to influence and impact healthcare trends and decisions. When celebrities advocate causes that are universally and uniformly acceptable and indisputable as the best in the realm of healthcare and cure (e.g. no smoking), it creates well-being and awareness in society at large. But those which are personal choices made out of a repertoire of other available and effective options may, because of celebrity preference, don the mantle of a norm. They thus run the danger of being blindly replicated by others without proper awareness and knowledge of the true potential of disease, risk factors, and other existing remedial or risk-reducing measures. Society should thus be encouraged to question, debate, and understand the validity, authenticity, and reason of the choices, especially those with a medical basis. This tempering of information with intelligence and rationale and making informed choices based on facts will serve humanity as a whole.	Goel, Nishu Singh	2013 Oct
24453948	Muscle-strengthening and conditioning activities and risk of type 2 diabetes: a prospective study in two cohorts of US women.	BACKGROUND: It is well established that aerobic physical activity can lower the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), but whether muscle-strengthening activities are beneficial for the prevention of T2D is unclear. This study examined the association of muscle-strengthening activities with the risk of T2D in women. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We prospectively followed up 99,316 middle-aged and older women for 8 years from the Nurses' Health Study ([NHS] aged 53-81 years, 2000-2008) and Nurses' Health Study II ([NHSII] aged 36-55 years, 2001-2009), who were free of diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases at baseline. Participants reported weekly time spent on resistance exercise, lower intensity muscular conditioning exercises (yoga, stretching, toning), and aerobic moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA) at baseline and in 2004/2005. Cox regression with adjustment for major determinants for T2D was carried out to examine the influence of these types of activities on T2D risk. During 705,869 person years of follow-up, 3,491 incident T2D cases were documented. In multivariable adjusted models including aerobic MVPA, the pooled relative risk (RR) for T2D for women performing 1-29, 30-59, 60-150, and >150 min/week of total muscle-strengthening and conditioning activities was 0.83, 0.93, 0.75, and 0.60 compared to women reporting no muscle-strengthening and conditioning activities (p<0.001 for trend). Furthermore, resistance exercise and lower intensity muscular conditioning exercises were each independently associated with lower risk of T2D in pooled analyses. Women who engaged in at least 150 min/week of aerobic MVPA and at least 60 min/week of muscle-strengthening activities had substantial risk reduction compared with inactive women (pooled RR = 0.33 [95% CI 0.29-0.38]). Limitations to the study include that muscle-strengthening and conditioning activity and other types of physical activity were assessed by a self-administered questionnaire and that the study population consisted of registered nurses with mostly European ancestry. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that engagement in muscle-strengthening and conditioning activities (resistance exercise, yoga, stretching, toning) is associated with a lower risk of T2D. Engagement in both aerobic MVPA and muscle-strengthening type activity is associated with a substantial reduction in the risk of T2D in middle-aged and older women.

24445161	Assessment of cardiac autonomic function in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy using short term heart rate variability measures.	BACKGROUND: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a hereditary neuromuscular disorder frequently associated with progressive cardiac dysfunction, and is one of the common causes of death in these children. Early diagnostic markers of cardiac involvement might help in timely intervention. In this study we compared the short term HRV measures of DMD children with that of healthy subjects. METHOD: One hundred and twenty-four genetically confirmed boys with DMD and 50 age matched controls were recruited. Error-free, electrocardiogram was recorded in all subjects at rest in the supine position. HRV parameters were computed in time and frequency domains. Time domain measures included standard deviation of NN interval (SDNN), and root of square mean of successive NN interval (RMSSD). Frequency domain consisted of total, low frequency and high frequency power values. Ratio of low frequency and high frequency power values (LF/HF) was determined using customized software. RESULTS: HRV parameters were significantly altered in DMD children as compared to healthy controls. Following parameters [mean (SD)] were reduced in DMD as compared to controls; RMSSD (in ms) [52.14 (33.2) vs 64.64 (43.2); p = 0.038], High frequency component (nu) [38.77 (14.4) vs 48.02 (17.1); p = 0.001] suggesting a loss of vagal tone. In contrast, measure of sympathovagal balance LF/HF [1.18 (0.87) vs 0.89 (0.79); p = 0.020] was increased in DMD group. CONCLUSION: In this cross sectional study we have demonstrated alteration in autonomic tone in DMD. Loss of vagal tone and an increase in sympathetic tone were observed in DMD children. Further prospective studies are required to confirm the utility of these measures as predictors of adverse cardiac outcome in DMD.

24434055	Medical yoga: another way of being in the world-a phenomenological study from the perspective of persons suffering from stress-related symptoms.	The prevalence of stress-related illness has grown in recent years. Many of these patients seek help in primary health care. Yoga can reduce stress and thus complements pharmacological therapy in medical practice. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated patients' experiences of yoga treatment in a primary health care setting or, specifically, the experiences of yoga when suffering from stress-related illness. Thus, the aim of the present study was to explore the meaning of participating in medical yoga as a complementary treatment for stress-related symptoms and diagnosis in a primary health care setting. This study has a descriptive phenomenological design and took place at a primary health care centre in Sweden during 2011. Five women and one man (43-51 years) participated. They were recruited from the intervention group (n=18) in a randomized control trial, in which they had participated in a medical yoga group in addition to standard care for 12 weeks. Data were collected by means of qualitative interviews, and a phenomenological data analysis was conducted. The essential meaning of the medical yoga experience was that the medical yoga was not an endpoint of recovery but the start of a process towards an increased sense of wholeness. It was described as a way of alleviating suffering, and it provided the participants with a tool for dealing with their stress and current situation on a practical level. It led to greater self-awareness and self-esteem, which in turn had an implicit impact on their lifeworld. In phenomenological terms, this can be summarized as Another way of being in the world, encompassing a perception of deepened identity. From a philosophical perspective, due to using the body in a new way (yoga), the participants had learnt to see things differently, which enriched and recast their perception of themselves and their lives.

24427189	Comparison of higher order spectra in heart rate signals during two techniques of meditation: Chi and Kundalini meditation.	The human heartbeat is one of the important examples of complex physiologic fluctuations. For the first time in this study higher order spectra of heart rate signals during meditation have explored. Specifically, the aim of this study was to analysis and compares the contribution of quadratic phase coupling of human heart rate variability during two forms of meditation: (1) Chinese Chi (or Qigong) meditation and (2) Kundalini Yoga meditation. For this purpose, Bispectrum was estimated by using biased, parametric and the direct (FFT) method. The results show that the mean Bispectrum magnitude of heart rate signals increased during Kundalini Yoga meditation, but it decreased significantly during Chi meditation. However, in both meditation techniques phase-coupled harmonics are shifted to the higher frequencies during meditation. In addition, it has shown that not only there are significant differences between rest and meditation states, but also heart rate patterns appear to be influenced by different types of meditation.

24423083	Update in pain medicine for primary care providers: a narrative review, 2010-2012.	OBJECTIVE: This manuscript reviews peer-reviewed literature published from 2010-2012 relevant to the management of chronic pain in the primary care setting. DESIGN: Narrative review of peer-reviewed literature. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, and reference lists and queried expert contacts for English-language studies related to the management of chronic noncancer pain in adult patients in primary care settings. One investigator reviewed all eligible studies for relevance, and 47 studies were reviewed by all authors and rated according to their impact on 1) primary care clinical practice, 2) policy, 3) research, and 4) quality of study methods. Through iterative discussion, nine articles were selected for detailed review and discussion. RESULTS: We present articles in six topic areas: interventional pain management; opioid dose and risk of overdose death; neuropathic pain; yoga for chronic low back pain; cognitive behavioral therapy; and systematic approaches to treating back pain. We discuss implications for pain management in primary care. CONCLUSIONS: There is growing evidence for the risks, benefits, and limitations of the multiple modalities available to primary care providers for the management of chronic pain. The dissemination and implementation of the evidence from these studies as well as novel system-level interventions warrant additional study and support from clinicians, educators, and policy makers.

24422341	Reaction time following yoga bellows-type breathing and breath awareness.	The reaction time (RT) was assessed in two groups of healthy males, yoga group (M age = 29.0 yr.) and non-yoga or control group (M age = 29.0 yr.), with 35 participants each. The yoga group had an average experience of 6 months, while the control group was yoga-naive. The yoga group was assessed in two sessions, (i) bhastrika pranayama or bellows breathing and (ii) breath awareness, while the control group had a single control session. The two experimental sessions, one with each type of breathing, and the control session consisted of pre- (5 min.), during (18 min.), and post-session epochs (5 min.). Assessments were made in the pre- and post-session epochs using a Multi-Operational Apparatus for Reaction Time. Following 18 min. of bhastrika pranayama there was a statistically significant reduction in number of anticipatory responses compared to before the practice. This suggests that the immediate effect of bhastrika pranayama is to inhibit unnecessary responding to stimuli.	Telles, Shirley;Yadav, Arti;Gupta, Ram Kumar;Balkrishna, Acharya	2013 Aug
24418351	Restorative yoga and metabolic risk factors: the Practicing Restorative Yoga vs. Stretching for the Metabolic Syndrome (PRYSMS) randomized trial.	AIMS: Intensive lifestyle change prevents type 2 diabetes but is difficult to sustain. Preliminary evidence suggests that yoga may improve metabolic factors. We tested a restorative yoga intervention vs. active stretching for metabolic outcomes. METHODS: In 2009-2012, we conducted a 48-week randomized trial comparing restorative yoga vs. stretching among underactive adults with the metabolic syndrome at the Universities of California, San Francisco and San Diego. We provided lifestyle counseling and a tapering series of 90-min group classes in the 24-week intervention period and 24-week maintenance period. Fasting and 2-h glucose, HbA1c, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, insulin, systolic blood pressure, visceral fat, and quality of life were assessed at baseline, 6- and 12-months. RESULTS: 180 participants were randomized and 135 (75%) completed the trial. At 12 months, fasting glucose decreased more in the yoga group than in the stretching group (-0.35 mmol/L vs. -0.03 mmol/L; p=0.002); there were no other significant differences between groups. At 6 months favorable changes within the yoga group included reductions in fasting glucose, insulin, and HbA1c and an increase in HDL-cholesterol that were not sustained at 1 year except changes in fasting glucose. The stretching group had a significant reduction in triglycerides at 6 months which was not sustained at 1 year but had improved quality of life at both time-points. CONCLUSIONS: Restorative yoga was marginally better than stretching for improving fasting glucose but not other metabolic factors.

24403034	Prenatal yoga in late pregnancy and optimism, power, and well-being.	The study reported here explored changes in optimism, power, and well-being over time in women who participated in a six-week prenatal yoga program during their second and third trimesters of pregnancy. The study was conceptualized from the perspective of Rogers' science of unitary human beings. A correlational, one-group, pre-post-assessment survey design with a convenience sample was conducted. Increases in mean scores for optimism, power, and well-being were statistically significant from baseline to completion of the prenatal yoga program. Findings from this study suggested that yoga as a self-care practice that nurses might recommend to promote well-being in pregnant women.	Reis, Pamela J;Alligood, Martha R	2014 Jan
24396319	Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine for the management of a 35-year-old man with chronic prostatitis with chronic pelvic pain syndrome.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this case report is to describe the resolution of pain in a patient with chronic prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome after receiving a course of management using acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 35-year-old man presented with chronic prostatitis with chronic pelvic pain syndrome. He scored 38 out of a possible 43 on the National Institutes of Health/Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH/CPSI) that rates pain, urinary symptoms, and quality of life impact, indicating severe symptoms. The patient had experienced recurrent episodes of nonbacterial prostatitis over a 3-year period, and this was the most severe. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: After 8 acupuncture treatments over an 8-week period and daily use of Ba Zheng San and Yi Guan Jian, the patient scored his symptoms 9 on the NIH/CPSI. The patient was then put on a supportive anti-inflammatory regimen of green tea. He rated his symptoms 4 on the NIH/CPSI 4 months later, 2 on the NIH/CPSI 8 months later, and 0 on the NIH/CPSI 1 year later. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrated that the patient experienced long-lasting relief from chronic prostatitis with chronic pelvic pain syndrome after a course of 8 treatments of acupuncture and Chinese herbs.

24387700	A randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of yoga with an active control on ambulatory blood pressure in individuals with prehypertension and stage 1 hypertension.	The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of yoga with an active control (nonaerobic exercise) in individuals with prehypertension and stage 1 hypertension. A randomized clinical trial was performed using two arms: (1) yoga and (2) active control. Primary outcomes were 24-hour day and night ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Within-group and between-group analyses were performed using paired t tests and repeated-measures analysis of variance (time x group), respectively. Eighty-four participants enrolled, with 68 participants completing the trial. Within-group analyses found 24-hour diastolic, night diastolic, and mean arterial pressure all significantly reduced in the yoga group (-3.93, -4.7, -4.23 mm Hg, respectively) but no significant within-group changes in the active control group. Direct comparisons of the yoga intervention with the control group found a single blood pressure variable (diastolic night) to be significantly different (P=.038). This study has demonstrated that a yoga intervention can lower blood pressure in patients with mild hypertension. Although this study was not adequately powered to show between-group differences, the size of the yoga-induced blood pressure reduction appears to justify performing a definitive trial of this intervention to test whether it can provide meaningful therapeutic value for the management of hypertension.

24383884	Effect of 12 weeks of yoga training on the somatization, psychological symptoms, and stress-related biomarkers of healthy women.	BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that the practice of yoga reduces perceived stress and negative feelings and that it improves psychological symptoms. Our previous study also suggested that long-term yoga training improves stress-related psychological symptoms such as anxiety and anger. However, little is known about the beneficial effects of yoga practice on somatization, the most common stress-related physical symptoms, and stress-related biomarkers. We performed a prospective, single arm study to examine the beneficial effects of 12 weeks of yoga training on somatization, psychological symptoms, and stress-related biomarkers. METHODS: We recruited healthy women who had no experience with yoga. The data of 24 participants who were followed during 12 weeks of yoga training were analyzed. Somatization and psychological symptoms were assessed before and after 12 weeks of yoga training using the Profile of Mood State (POMS) and the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R) questionnaires. Urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), biopyrrin, and cortisol levels were measured as stress-related biomarkers. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the stress-related biomarkers and the scores of questionnaires before and after 12 weeks of yoga training. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of yoga training, all negative subscale scores (tension-anxiety, depression, anger-hostility, fatigue, and confusion) from the POMS and somatization, anxiety, depression, and hostility from the SCL-90-R were significantly decreased compared with those before starting yoga training. Contrary to our expectation, the urinary 8-OHdG concentration after 12 weeks of yoga training showed a significant increase compared with that before starting yoga training. No significant changes were observed in the levels of urinary biopyrrin and cortisol after the 12 weeks of yoga training. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga training has the potential to reduce the somatization score and the scores related to mental health indicators, such as anxiety, depression, anger, and fatigue. The present findings suggest that yoga can improve somatization and mental health status and has implications for the prevention of psychosomatic symptoms in healthy women.

24381824	Yoga in the Real World: Perceptions, Motivators, Barriers, and patterns of Use.	BACKGROUND: Yoga is a mind-body exercise practiced by nearly 16 million US adults. Clinical yoga research has yielded promising findings in physical and mental health outcomes. However, research in non-patient populations is limited. The purpose of this study is to survey a non-clinical population to better understand yoga use in a real-world setting. METHODS: This study used a pre-post test design in a convenience sample of adults registered for a 4-week beginner yoga program within a network of five yoga studios in Austin, Texas. Students were linked via e-mail to baseline and endpoint surveys. Analyses were descriptive. RESULTS: Six hundred four students completed the baseline survey, and 290 (48%) completed the 4-week endpoint survey. Baseline demographics were similar to those in national surveys, with respondents being primarily female (86%), white (88%), and college educated (78%). The primary barrier to practice was time (55%). Respondents perceived yoga primarily as an exercise activity (92%), spiritual activity (73%), or a way to manage or treat a health condition (50%). Main reasons for taking yoga were general wellness (81%), physical exercise (80%), and stress management (73%). Ninety-eight percent believed yoga would improve their health, with 28% taking yoga to alleviate a health condition. On average, respondents practiced 3 to 4 hours/ week in and out of class. CONCLUSIONS: Respondent demographics were consistent with national survey data. Data show that yoga is perceived several ways. Information on practice patterns provides new information, which may improve understanding of how non-clinical populations incorporate yoga into daily life for health management.

24381464	Serum mineral status and climacteric symptoms in perimenopausal women before and after Yoga therapy, an ongoing study.	BACKGROUND: Many women report an increased level of anxiety, irritability and mood swings during their perimenopausal state. Studies show that physically active people can reduce their anxiety and depression by practicing yoga. Serum minerals such as calcium, copper and magnesium and the ferro-oxidase, ceruloplasmin play an important role in the body during the perimenopausal period. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to assess the serum mineral status, anthropometric parameters and climacteric symptoms in perimenopausal women before and after yoga intervention. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of 30 subjects with perimenopausal symptoms, aged between 40 and 60 years (49.43 +/- 6.15) were included in the study. Yoga intervention was given on a daily basis (45 min duration) for 12 weeks. The climacteric symptoms were assessed by Greene's climacteric scale and biochemical parameters were analyzed spectrophotometrically. RESULTS: A significant decrease in the waist hip ratio (P < 0.036) and body mass index (P < 0.036) was observed after yoga intervention. Systolic (P < 0.064) and diastolic (P < 0.082) blood pressure (BP) showed marginal decrease after yoga therapy. Climacteric symptoms improved significantly (P < 0.001) after yoga intervention. A significant increase (P < 0.001) in serum calcium and copper and a marked decrease in serum magnesium (P < 0.05) and ceruloplasmin (P < 0.028) levels was observed, post yoga therapy. Serum magnesium negatively correlated (r = -0.467, P < 0.035) with systolic BP after yoga intervention. CONCLUSION: The overall changes observed in the mineral status and climacteric symptoms suggest that yoga therapy protocol can be effectively used to improve the quality of life in perimenopausal women.

24376429	Plasticity of visual attention in Isha yoga meditation practitioners before and after a 3-month retreat.	Meditation has lately received considerable interest from cognitive neuroscience. Studies suggest that daily meditation leads to long lasting attentional and neuronal plasticity. We present changes related to the attentional systems before and after a 3 month intensive meditation retreat. We used three behavioral psychophysical tests - a Stroop task, an attentional blink task, and a global-local letter task-to assess the effect of Isha yoga meditation on attentional resource allocation. 82 Isha yoga practitioners were tested at the beginning and at the end of the retreat. Our results showed an increase in correct responses specific to incongruent stimuli in the Stroop task. Congruently, a positive correlation between previous meditation experience and accuracy to incongruent Stroop stimuli was also observed at baseline. We also observed a reduction of the attentional blink. Unexpectedly, a negative correlation between previous meditation experience and attentional blink performance at baseline was observed. Regarding spatial attention orientation as assessed using the global-local letter task, participants showed a bias toward local processing. Only slight differences in performance were found pre- vs. post- meditation retreat. Biasing toward the local stimuli in the global-local task and negative correlation of previous meditation experience with attentional blink performance is consistent with Isha practices being focused-attention practices. Given the relatively small effect sizes and the absence of a control group, our results do not allow clear support nor rejection of the hypothesis of meditation-driven neuronal plasticity in the attentional system for Isha yoga practice.

24374098	Effects of acceleration level on lumbar spine injuries in military populations.	BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Clinical studies have indicated that thoracolumbar trauma occurs in the civilian population at its junction. In contrast, injury patterns in military populations indicate a shift to the inferior vertebral levels of the lumbar spine. Controlled studies offering an explanation for such migrations and the associated clinical biomechanics are sparse in literature. PURPOSE: The goals of this study were to investigate the potential roles of acceleration loading on the production of injuries and their stability characteristics using a human cadaver model for applications to high-speed aircraft ejection and helicopter crashes. STUDY DESIGN: Biomechanical laboratory study using unembalmed human cadaver lumbar spinal columns. METHODS: Thoracolumbar columns from post-mortem human surrogates were procured, x-rays taken, intervertebral joints and bony components evaluated for degeneration, and fixed using polymethylmethacrylate. The inferior end was attached to a platform via a load cell and uniaxial accelerometer. The superior end was attached to the upper metal platform via a semi-circular cylinder. The pre-flexed specimen was preloaded to simulate torso mass. The ends of the platform were connected to the vertical post of a custom-designed drop tower. The specimen was dropped inducing acceleration loading to the column. Axial force and acceleration data were gathered at high sampling rates, filtered, and peak accelerations and inertia-compensated axial forces were obtained during the loading phase. Computed tomography images were used to identify and classify injuries using the three-column concept (stable vs. unstable trauma). RESULTS: The mean age, total body mass, and stature of the five healthy degeneration-free specimens were 42 years, 73 kg, and 167 cm. The first two specimens subjected to peak accelerations of approximately 200 m/sec(2) were classified as belonging to high-speed aircraft ejection-type and the other three specimens subjected to greater amplitudes (347-549 m/sec(2)) were classified as belonging to helicopter crash-type loadings. Peak axial forces for all specimens ranged from 4.8 to 7.2 kN. Ejection-type loaded specimens sustained single-level injuries to the L1 vertebra; one injury was stable and the other was unstable. Helicopter crash-type loaded specimens sustained injuries at inferior levels, including bilateral facet dislocation at L4-L5 and L2-L4 compression fractures, and all specimens were considered unstable at least at one spinal level. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the severity of spinal injuries increase with increasing acceleration levels and, more importantly, injuries shift inferiorly from the thoracolumbar junction to lower lumbar levels. Acknowledging that the geometry and load carrying capacity of vertebral bodies increase in the lower lumbar spine, involvement of inferior levels in trauma sparing the superior segments at greater acceleration inputs agree with military literature of caudal shift in injured levels. The present study offers an experimental explanation for the clinically observed caudal migration of spinal trauma in military populations as applied to high-speed aircraft ejection catapult and helicopter crashes.

27489663	A case of non-paraneoplastic anti-N-methyl d-aspartate receptor encephalitis presenting as a neuropsychiatric disorder.	N-methyl d-aspartate receptor antibody encephalitis can often be a paraneoplastic manifestation of occult malignancy such as ovarian teratoma and rarely teratoma of mediastinum or testis and small cell lung carcinoma. We report a case of non-paraneoplastic anti-N-methyl d-aspartate receptor antibody-positive autoimmune encephalitis in a young patient who presented with neuropsychiatric features and made a very good recovery following treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids. The case highlights the need for increased vigilance for the condition in young females with or without a previous psychiatric history and emphasises the need for a multidisciplinary approach in the management of this challenging disorder with a good prognosis.

27417488	Integrative Therapy Use for Management of Side Effects and Toxicities Experienced by Pediatric Oncology Patients.	Integrative Therapies (IT), otherwise known as Complementary and Alternative Medicine, are widely used among pediatric oncology patients, despite a paucity of available evidence. This review summarizes surveys that describe the prevalence of IT use by pediatric oncology patients, both during therapy and in survivorship, as well as the modalities being used. Additionally, the evidence that exists for specific treatments that appear to be efficacious in controlling specific symptoms is described. Finally, there are recommendations for practitioners on how to best counsel patients about IT use.	Jacobs, Shana S	2014 Nov 14
26824154	Designing Exercise and Nutrition Programs to Promote Normal Weight Maintenance for Nurses.	Living a healthy lifestyle is a constant choice. As a life goal, it is a decision to uphold every moment and is best achieved with support of others. There are a multitude of workplace wellness and healthy lifestyle programs that address achieving and maintaining the goal of normal weight over a lifetime. Fewer such evidence based programs exist and a goal of our hospital is to create a comprehensive wellness program based on evidence. In the context of normal weight maintenance in nurses, this article discusses selected challenges for healthy eating and exercise and nurse fitness programs based on the author and her colleagues experiences with specific obesity research interventions, such as Nurses Living FitTM, that we designed and offered. An exemplar provides details about our wellness programs, which included three annual walk or run events, one full day conference, and a series of multiple exercise, yoga, and nutrition sessions. Our goal was to expose nurses to healthier lifestyle aspects with a primary focus on the optimal balance of exercise and nutrition. Over the years of research, events, and programs, greater than 1,000 people have participated. The conclusion includes implications for education and practice in the hope that our experiences may motive nurses to design exercise and nutrition programs to promote normal weight maintenance in nurses.

25861453	Yoga for the Treatment of Insomnia among Cancer Patients: Evidence, Mechanisms of Action, and Clinical Recommendations.	Up to 90% of cancer patients report symptoms of insomnia during and after treatment. Symptoms of insomnia include excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, and waking up too early. Insomnia symptoms are among the most prevalent, distressing and persistent cancer- and cancer treatment-related toxicities reported by patients, and can be severe enough to increase cancer morbidity and mortality. Despite the ubiquity of insomnia symptoms, they are under-screened, under-diagnosed, and under-treated in cancer patients. When insomnia symptoms are identified, providers are hesitant to prescribe, and patients are hesitant to take pharmaceuticals due to polypharmacy concerns. In addition, sleep medications do not cure insomnia. Yoga is a well-tolerated mode of exercise with promising evidence for its efficacy in improving insomnia symptoms among cancer patients. This article reviews existing clinical research on the effectiveness of yoga for treating insomnia among cancer patients. The article also provides clinical recommendations for prescribing yoga for the treatment of insomnia in this population.	Mustian, Karen M;Janelsins, Michelle;Peppone, Luke J;Kamen, Charles	2014
25841479	Neuropathic pain in cancer.	Unrelieved neuropathic pain continues to be a substantial health problem in a cancer patient arises either due to disease itself or its treatment. Review of literature showed that neuropathic pain has high prevalence rate, greater severity and analgesic requirement with worse quality of life. Underreporting by patient and under treatment by physician is an important causative factor of indefinite persistence of neuropathic pain. Careful history taking, elaborated physical examination, patient's self report and diagnostic tools with high sensitivity and specificity are needed for accurate assessment of neuropathic pain. Neuropathic cancer pain is difficult to treat and also shows poor response to opioids so in this situation alternate a treatment strategy that also includes psycosocial and spiritual counseling with yoga and meditation exercises under the palliative care framework should be practiced. To find out the burden and estimation of resource generation of this widely recognized problem, accurate establishment of incidence, prevalence, severity, and effectiveness of treatment is quite mandatory. Complex phenomenon of neuropathic pain abolishes establishment of early diagnosis and accurate etiology of this symptom, emphasizes the need of sensitive and reliable clinical grading scale, international classification system and validated diagnostic tools that correspond with clinical assessment. Multiple studies towards this direction has been culminated and some are still going on, though the data and literature is very scant and require further research for the complete evaluation of neuropathic pain.

25810693	Implementing Yoga Therapy Adapted for Older Veterans Who Are Cancer Survivors.	OBJECTIVES: This goal of this paper is to describe the reach, application, and effectiveness of an 8-week yoga therapy protocol with older cancer survivors within a Veterans Health Administration setting. METHODS: To document the reach of this intervention, recruitment efforts, attendance, and practice rates were tracked. To explore the application of the protocol to this population, physical therapy pre-assessment and observations by the yoga therapist were recorded to ascertain necessary pose modifications. Effectiveness was measured through pre- and post-course structured interviews, tracking self-reported symptoms of combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, and pain. RESULTS: Regarding reach, 15% of eligible veterans (n = 14) enrolled, participated in 3-16 classes (M+/-SD = 11.64+/-3.39), and practiced at home for 0-56 days (M+/-SD = 26.36+/-17.87). Participants were primarily Caucasian (n = 13), male (n = 13), ranged in age from 55 to 78 years (M+/-SD = 65.64+/-5.15), and had multiple medical problems. During application, substantial individualized modifications to the yoga therapy protocol were necessary. Effectiveness of the intervention was mixed. During post-course interviews, participants reported a variety of qualitative benefits. Notably, the majority of participants reported that breathing and relaxation techniques were the most useful to learn. Group comparisons of mean pre- and post-course scores on standardized measures showed no significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: A minority of older veterans express an interest in yoga, but those who do have high rates of class attendance and home practice. Careful physical pre-assessment and attentive therapists are required to undertake the adaptations required by participants with multiple comorbidities. The effectiveness of yoga in this setting requires additional study.

25741245	Hemodynamic responses on prefrontal cortex related to meditation and attentional task.	Recent neuroimaging studies state that meditation increases regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The present study employed functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to evaluate the relative hemodynamic changes in PFC during a cognitive task. Twenty-two healthy male volunteers with ages between 18 and 30 years (group mean age +/- SD; 22.9 +/- 4.6 years) performed a color-word stroop task before and after 20 min of meditation and random thinking. Repeated measures ANOVA was performed followed by a post hoc analysis with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons between the mean values of "During" and "Post" with "Pre" state. During meditation there was an increased in oxy-hemoglobin (DeltaHbO) and total hemoglobin (DeltaTHC) concentration with reduced deoxy-hemoglobin (DeltaHbR) concentration over the right prefrontal cortex (rPFC), whereas in random thinking there was increased DeltaHbR with reduced total hemoglobin concentration on the rPFC. The mean reaction time (RT) was shorter during stroop color word task with concomitant reduction in DeltaTHC after meditation, suggestive of improved performance and efficiency in task related to attention. Our findings demonstrated that meditation increased cerebral oxygenation and enhanced performance, which was associated with activation of the PFC.

24366852	Effects of yoga on psychological health in older adults.	BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to assess the effect of a yoga intervention on psychological health in older adults. METHOD: A randomized controlled trial study, conducted at 2 North Florida facilities for older adults. Subjects were 98 older adults, ages 65 to 92. Participants were randomly assigned to chair yoga, chair exercise, and control groups and assessed preintervention, postintervention, and 1-month follow-up on the State Anger Expression Inventory, State Anxiety Inventory, Geriatric Depression Scale, Lawton's PGC Morale Scale, General Self-Efficacy Scale, Chronic Disease Self-Efficacy Scales, and Self- Control Schedule. RESULTS: Yoga participants improved more than both exercise and control participants in anger (Cohen's d = 0.89 for yoga versus exercise, and 0.90 for yoga versus control, pretest to posttest; and d = 0.90 and 0.72, pretest to follow-up), anxiety (d = 0.27, 0.39 and 0.62, 0.63), depression (d = 0.47, 0.49 and 0.53, 0.51), well-being (d = 0.14, 0.49 and 0.25, 0.61), general self-efficacy (d = 0.63, 1.10 and 0.30, 0.85), and self-efficacy for daily living (d = 0.52, 0.81 and 0.27, 0.42). Changes in self-control moderated changes in psychological health. CONCLUSIONS: Over a 6-week period, our findings indicate yoga's potential for improving psychological health in older adults.

24349740	Comparison of the Effect of 8 weeks Aerobic and Yoga Training on Ambulatory Function, Fatigue and Mood Status in MS Patients.	BACKGROUND: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system that results in many symptoms including mobility limitation and fatigue. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-one MS patients, all female with mean of age of 36.75 years and Expanded Disability Status Scale scores (EDSS) of 1.0 to 4.0 were recruited. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: treadmill training, yoga or control groups. Treadmill training and yoga practice consisted of 8 weeks (24 sessions, thrice weekly). The control group followed their own routine treatment program. Balance, speed and endurance of walking, fatigue, depression and anxiety were measured by Berg Balance scores, time for 10m walk and distance for a two minute walk, Fatigue Severity Scale (FFS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), respectively. RESULTS: Comparison of results have shown that pre- and post-interventions produced significant improvements in the balance score, walking endurance, FFS score, BDI score and BAI score in the treadmill training group and yoga group. However, 10m walk time decreased in the treadmill training group but did not show any clear change in the yoga group. Moreover, the analysis showed significant differences between the treadmill training group and yoga group for BAI score. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that treadmill training and yoga practice improved ambulatory function, fatigue and mood status in the individuals with mild to moderate MS.

24347909	Randomized Controlled Trial in Advance Stage Breast Cancer Patients for the Effectiveness on Stress Marker and Pain through Sudarshan Kriya and Pranayam.	OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine the effect of a cognitive, behavioral stress management module of Sudarshan Kriya (SK) and P on levels of serum cortisol and pain among the women suffering from advanced stage breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants (n = 147) were screened and randomized to receive standard care (n = 69) versus standard along with SK and Pranayam (P) intervention (n = 78) imparted in one 18 hrs workshop spread during 3 days. Participants were expected to practice it at home 20 min daily as adjuvant to standard pharmacological treatment for pain. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in blood cortisol levels after 3 months of practice of SK and P. Mean blood levels in the intervention arm were 341.2 ng/ml against 549.2 ng/ml in the control arm (P </= 0.002). Pain perception in comparison to control arm reduced by 3 points in SK and P arm on 0-10 verbal scale of pain. CONCLUSION: SK and P is an effective intervention in reducing stress and pain among advance stage patients of breast cancer.

24347088	Breathing exercises for dysfunctional breathing/hyperventilation syndrome in children.	BACKGROUND: Dysfunctional breathing is described as chronic or recurrent changes in breathing pattern causing respiratory and non-respiratory symptoms. It is an umbrella term that encompasses hyperventilation syndrome and vocal cord dysfunction. Dysfunctional breathing affects 10% of the general population. Symptoms include dyspnoea, chest tightness, sighing and chest pain which arise secondary to alterations in respiratory pattern and rate. Little is known about dysfunctional breathing in children. Preliminary data suggest 5.3% or more of children with asthma have dysfunctional breathing and that, unlike in adults, it is associated with poorer asthma control. It is not known what proportion of the general paediatric population is affected. Breathing training is recommended as a first-line treatment for adults with dysfunctional breathing (with or without asthma) but no similar recommendations are available for the management of children. As such, breathing retraining is adapted from adult regimens based on the age and ability of the child. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether breathing retraining in children with dysfunctional breathing has beneficial effects as measured by quality of life indices.To determine whether there are any adverse effects of breathing retraining in young people with dysfunctional breathing. SEARCH METHODS: We identified trials for consideration using both electronic and manual search strategies. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE. We searched the National Research Register (NRR) Archive, Health Services Research Projects in Progress (HSRProj), Current Controlled Trials register (incorporating the metaRegister of Controlled Trials and the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) to identify research in progress and unpublished research. The latest search was undertaken in October 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA: We planned to include randomised, quasi-randomised or cluster-randomised controlled trials. We excluded observational studies, case studies and studies utilising a cross-over design. The cross-over design was considered inappropriate due to the purported long-lasting effects of breathing retraining. Children up to the age of 18 years with a clinical diagnosis of dysfunctional breathing were eligible for inclusion. We planned to include children with a primary diagnosis of asthma with the intention of undertaking a subgroup analysis. Children with symptoms secondary to cardiac or metabolic disease were excluded.We considered any type of breathing retraining exercise for inclusion in this review, such as breathing control, diaphragmatic breathing, yoga breathing, Buteyko breathing, biofeedback-guided breathing modification and yawn/sigh suppression. We considered programmes where exercises were either supervised (by parents or a health professional, or both) or unsupervised. We also considered relaxation techniques and acute episode management as long as it was clear that breathing exercises were a component of the intervention.Any intervention without breathing exercises or where breathing exercises were not key to the intervention were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We planned that two authors (NJB and MJ) would extract data independently using a standardised form. Any discrepancies would be resolved by consensus. Where agreement could not be reached a third review author (MLE) would have considered the paper. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 264 potential trials and reviews from the search. Following removal of duplicates, we screened 224 papers based on title and abstract. We retrieved six full-text papers and further evaluated them but they did not meet the inclusion criteria. There were, therefore, no studies suitable for inclusion in this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results of this systematic review cannot inform clinical practice as no suitable trials were identified for inclusion. Therefore, it is currently unknown whether these interventions offer any added value in this patient group or whether specific types of breathing exercise demonstrate superiority over others. Given that breathing exercises are frequently used to treat dysfunctional breathing/hyperventilation syndrome, there is an urgent need for well-designed clinical trials in this area. Future trials should conform to the CONSORT statement for standards of reporting and use validated outcome measures. Trial reports should also ensure full disclosure of data for all important clinical outcomes.	Barker, Nicola J;Jones, Mandy;O'Connell, Neil E;Everard, Mark L	2013 Dec 18
24338229	Assessment of the quality of life in patients with bronchial asthma, before and after yoga: a randomised trial.	Yoga which is used as an adjunct treatment for bronchial asthma is gaining popularity throughout the world. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of yoga on quality of life in patients with bronchial asthma. 120 non-smoking male and female patients of asthma in the age group of 17-50 years were randomized into two groups i.e. Group A (Yoga group) and Group B (control group). All patients remained on their prescribed medication, but Group A patients practiced yoga breathing exercises for 8 weeks. Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) and diary record was used to assess quality of life, number and severity of asthmatic attacks, and the dosage of the medication required at baseline and after 8 weeks. Group A subjects showed a statistically significant improvement in "symptoms", "activities" and "environmental" domains of AQLQ at 8 weeks (p<0.01) and significant reduction in daily number and severity of attacks, and the dosage of medication required at 4 and 8 weeks (p<0.01) compared to the baseline. Yoga breathing exercises used adjunctively with standard pharmacological treatment significantly improved quality of life in patients with bronchial asthma.

24334325	The role of body awareness and mindfulness in the relationship between exercise and eating behavior.	This study examined the potential mediating roles of mindfulness and body awareness in the relationship between exercise and eating behavior. Female exercisers (N = 159) recruited from fitness centers, yoga centers, and the community completed a questionnaire incorporating measures of exercise behavior, body awareness, trait mindfulness, mindful eating, dietary intake, and disordered eating symptoms. Participation in yoga was associated with significantly lower disordered eating (mediated by body awareness), whereas the amount of time spent participating in cardio-based exercise was associated with greater eating disturbance. The relationships between amount of exercise and actual food intake were not mediated by trait mindfulness or body awareness. The differential findings for dietary intake and disordered eating indicate that the body awareness cultivated in different forms of exercise may be more beneficial for clinical populations or those at risk for eating disorders than for modifying actual dietary intake in the general population.

24328918	Self-care and yoga-academic-practice collaboration for occupational health.	High rates of stress and burnout among nurses and other health care providers justify the exploration of innovative interventions designed to reduce stress and promote self-care among this population. A growing body of evidence supports the physical and psychosocial benefits of yoga and suggests the potential for yoga to support self-care and reduce stress among health care providers. This article describes the formation of an academic-practice collaboration to use yoga as a model for occupational health and wellness among nurses employed at a tax-supported urban health system. In addition, recommendations for program sustainability over time are discussed.	Alexander, Gina	2013 Dec
24327764	The effectiveness of facial exercises for facial rejuvenation: a systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Although aesthetic correction of facial aging had long been the exclusive domain of plastic surgeons and dermatologists, alternative nonmedical approaches to facial rejuvenation are becoming more popular, such as facial acupuncture, facial acupressure, and facial exercises. However, the effectiveness of these alternative approaches is still a topic of debate. OBJECTIVES: The authors review the evidence of the effectiveness of facial exercises for facial rejuvenation. METHODS: A literature search was performed in Medline, Web of Science, Science Direct, SciELO, and LILACS databases for the terms facial rejuvenation, facial exercises, facial massage, face building, face yoga, (oro)facial (a)esthetics, (a)esthetic logopedics, and (a)esthetic speech therapy. Nine reports were identified from the search and were subject to further assessment. RESULTS: Although positive outcomes were achieved in all 9 studies, none of the studies used a control group and randomization process. They were single case reports, small case series, or studies with a single-group pretest-posttest design. Moreover, the effectiveness assessments in most of the studies were purely subjective, carried out by the authors and/or the patients themselves, without blinding. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence to date is insufficient to determine whether facial exercises are effective for facial rejuvenation. Evidence from large randomized controlled trials will be needed before conclusions can be drawn.	Van Borsel, John;De Vos, Marie-Camille;Bastiaansen, Karen;Welvaert, Jaira;Lambert, Jo	2014 Jan 1
24319559	Assessment of health-promoting behavior and lifestyle of adolescents of a north Indian city.	BACKGROUND: Several health-compromising behaviors (e.g., smoking, alcohol) as well as health-enhancing behaviors (e.g., physical exercise, nutrition) are adopted in adolescence and they often persist into adulthood. Thus, there is a definite need to investigate the health behavior of adolescents rather than focus on adults since it will be far more difficult for adults to change their unhealthy habits adopted in their youth. Therefore, the present study was conducted to ascertain health-promoting behavior and lifestyle of university graduates of Chandigarh. METHODS: The present cross-sectional pilot study was conducted in Chandigarh during 2009 among university graduates of Chandigarh aged 17-20 years. A semi-structured, pretested questionnaire comprising of 28 items was used to get information from students regarding their involvement in diet, physical exercise, spirituality and philanthropy. Height, weight, waist and hip circumference of the respondents were measured using standardized equipments and procedures. RESULTS: Mean score of health-promoting lifestyle profile of university graduates was found to be 67.5 +/- 12.1 (maximum attainable score = 106). Fourteen students were found to be overweight. Frequent intake of fast food and less consumption of fruits and vegetables was reported by the students. Majority of students exercised as part of their daily routine. CONCLUSIONS: The result of the study showed that North Indian students had reasonably good orientations toward health behaviors, with a mean score of 67.5. The topics related to diet, physical exercise, spiritual growth and philanthropy promotion should be incorporated within the curriculum of students for their all round personality development.

24315281	Complementary therapies for osteoarthritis: are they effective?	Increasing interest has focused on complementary management modalities, including tai chi, acupuncture, yoga, and massage therapy, as treatments for osteoarthritis (OA). This review article synthesizes evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews (SRs) that examined one or more of the above as treatments for OA. Medline, Pubmed, and Cinahl databases were searched to identify English-language articles using an RCT design or that conducted a SR of published studies and presented data on symptom or functional outcomes. Two authors independently abstracted relevant information (e.g., study sample, intervention characteristics, treatment effects, safety data). Retained articles (n = 29) included those that evaluated tai chi (8 RCTs, 2 SRs), acupuncture (11 RCTs, 4 SRs), yoga (2 RCTs), and massage therapy (2 RCTs). Available evidence indicates that tai chi, acupuncture, yoga, and massage therapy are safe for use by individuals with OA. Positive short-term (</=6 months) effects in the form of reduced pain and improved self-reported physical functioning were found for all 4 treatments. Limited information exists regarding the relative effectiveness of the therapies (e.g., yoga vs. tai chi vs. acupuncture), as well as treatment effects in persons with joint involvement besides the knee and in distinct patient subgroups (e.g., older vs. younger adults, persons with mild vs. moderate vs. advanced disease). Complementary therapies can reduce pain and improve function in adults with OA. Research is needed to evaluate long-term benefits of the treatments, as well as their relative effects among diverse patient subgroups.

24314119	Impact of yoga on blood pressure and quality of life in patients with hypertension - a controlled trial in primary care, matched for systolic blood pressure.	BACKGROUND: Medical treatment of hypertension is not always sufficient to achieve blood pressure control. Despite this, previous studies on supplementary therapies, such as yoga, are relatively few. We investigated the effects of two yoga interventions on blood pressure and quality of life in patients in primary health care diagnosed with hypertension. METHODS: Adult patients (age 20-80 years) with diagnosed hypertension were identified by an electronic chart search at a primary health care center in southern Sweden. In total, 83 subjects with blood pressure values of 120-179/</=109 mmHg at baseline were enrolled. At baseline, the patients underwent standardized blood pressure measurement at the health care center and they completed a questionnaire on self-rated quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF). There were three groups: 1) yoga class with yoga instructor (n = 28); 2) yoga at home (n = 28); and 3) a control group (n = 27). The participants were matched at the group level for systolic blood pressure. After 12 weeks of intervention, the assessments were performed again. At baseline a majority of the patients (92%) were on antihypertensive medication, and the patients were requested not to change their medication during the study. RESULTS: The yoga class group showed no improvement in blood pressure or self-rated quality of life, while in the yoga at home group there was a decline in diastolic blood pressure of 4.4 mmHg (p < 0.05) compared to the control group. Moreover, the yoga at home group showed significant improvement in self-rated quality of life compared to the control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A short yoga program for the patient to practice at home seems to have an antihypertensive effect, as well as a positive effect on self-rated quality of life compared to controls. This implies that simple yoga exercises may be useful as a supplementary blood pressure therapy in addition to medical treatment when prescribed by primary care physicians.

24302466	Exercise programs for people with dementia.	BACKGROUND: This is an update of our previous 2008 review. Several recent trials and systematic reviews of the impact of exercise on people with dementia are reporting promising findings. OBJECTIVES: Primary: Do exercise programs for older people with dementia improve cognition, activities of daily living (ADLs), challenging behaviour, depression, and mortality in older people with dementia?Secondary: Do exercise programs for older people with dementia have an indirect impact on family caregivers' burden, quality of life, and mortality?Do exercise programs for older people with dementia reduce the use of healthcare services (e.g. visits to the emergency department) by participants and their family caregivers? SEARCH METHODS: We identified trials for inclusion in the review by searching ALOIS (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois), the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register, on 4 September 2011, and again on 13 August 2012. The search terms used were: 'physical activity' OR exercise OR cycling OR swim* OR gym* OR walk* OR danc* OR yoga OR 'tai chi'. SELECTION CRITERIA: In this review, we included randomized controlled trials in which older people, diagnosed with dementia, were allocated either to exercise programs or to control groups (usual care or social contact/activities) with the aim of improving cognition, ADLs, behaviour, depression, and mortality. Secondary outcomes related to the family caregiver(s) and included caregiver burden, quality of life, mortality, and use of healthcare services. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Independently, at least two authors assessed the retrieved articles for inclusion, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data. Data were analysed for summary effects using RevMan 5.1 software. We calculated mean differences or standardized mean difference (SMD) for continuous data, and synthesized data for each outcome using a fixed-effect model, unless there was substantial heterogeneity between studies, when we used a random-effects model. We planned to explore heterogeneity in relation to severity and type of dementia, and type, frequency, and duration of exercise program. We also evaluated adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen trials with 937 participants met the inclusion criteria. However, the required data from three trials and some of the data from a fourth trial were not published and not made available. The included trials were highly heterogeneous in terms of subtype and severity of participants' dementia, and type, duration and frequency of exercise. Only two trials included participants living at home. Our meta-analysis suggested that exercise programs might have a significant impact on improving cognitive functioning (eight trials, 329 participants; SMD 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 1.09). However, there was substantial heterogeneity between trials (I(2) value 80%), most of which we were unable to explain. We repeated the analysis omitting one trial, an outlier, that included only participants with moderate or severe dementia. This reduced the heterogeneity somewhat (I(2) value 68%), and produced a result that was no longer significant (seven trials, 308 participants; SMD 0.31, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.74). We found a significant effect of exercise programs on the ability of people with dementia to perform ADLs (six studies, 289 participants; SMD 0.68, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.27). However, again we observed considerable unexplained statistical heterogeneity (I(2) value 77%) in this meta-analysis. This means that there is a need for caution in interpreting these findings. In further analyses, we found that the burden experienced by informal caregivers providing care in the home may be reduced when they supervise the participation of the family member with dementia in an exercise program (one study, 40 participants; MD -15.30, 95% CI -24.73 to -5.87), but we found no significant effect of exercise on challenging behaviours (one study, 110 participants; MD -0.60, 95% CI -4.22 to 3.02), or depression (six studies, 341 participants; MD -0.14, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.07) . We could not examine the remaining outcomes, quality of life, mortality, and healthcare costs, as either the appropriate data were not reported, or we did not retrieve trials that examined these outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is promising evidence that exercise programs can have a significant impact in improving ability to perform ADLs and possibly in improving cognition in people with dementia, although some caution is advised in interpreting these findings. The programs revealed no significant effect on challenging behaviours or depression. There was little or no evidence regarding the remaining outcomes of interest.

24298457	Effect of yoga on autonomic functions and psychological status during both phases of menstrual cycle in young healthy females.	CONTEXT: Premenstrual stress affects 75% of women of childbearing age and yoga has been found to be beneficial in many psycho-somatic disorders. AIMS: To investigate the effect of integrated yoga on autonomic parameters and psychological well-being during both pre and post phases of menstrual cycle in healthy young female subjects. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Present study is a randomized control trial and was conducted in the Department of Physiology, Lady Hardinge Medical College, New Delhi, India. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty apparently healthy females in the age group of 18-20 years were randomized into two groups: Group I (n=25) consisted of subjects who practiced yoga 35-40 minutes per day, six times per week for the duration of three menstrual cycles. Training was given by qualified yoga instructor. Group II (n=25) subjects acted as controls. Following parameters were recorded at the beginning and after completion of three menstrual cycles in all the subjects: Height, weight (BW), Resting Heart Rate (HR), Resting Systolic (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), parasympathetic reactivity tests including Expiration-Inspiration Ratio (E: I ratio) and 30:15 ratio, sympathetic reactivity tests including BP changes due to Isometric Hand Grip (IHG) exercise, and Cold Pressor Test (CPT). Assessment of psychological status was done by administering DIPAS (Defense Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences) inventories of Anger self report scale, Trait Anxiety, Sense of well-being and Depression scale. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Intra-group comparison of physiological parameters was done by using paired 't' test, whereas intra-group comparison of non-parameteric data such as scores of anxiety, depression, anger and sense of well-being was done by Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Inter-group comparison of parameters was done by Students 't' test for parametric tests and Mann-Whitney 'U' test for non-parameteric tests. RESULTS: There was significantly higher BW, resting SBP, DBP, sympathetic activity and blunting of parasympathetic reactivity and also, significantly higher scores of anger, depression, anxiety and decreased score of well-being in premenstrual phase as compared to postmenstrual phase in both the groups in initial cycle. There was significantly higher percentage decrease in BW, HR, SBP & DBP in yoga group as compared to control group in both the phases from initial to second and onwards between second and third menstrual cycle. Also, decrease in anger, depression and anxiety and increase in well-being score was significant in yoga group as compared to control group from initial to second and third cycle in premenstrual phase while the change was significant only in depression score in postmenstrual phase. CONCLUSION: Our study shows that there was significant alteration of autonomic functions and psychological status in premenstrual phase when compared with postmenstrual phase in young healthy females. Also, regular practice of yoga has beneficial effects on both phases of menstrual cycle by bringing parasympathodominance and psychological well-being probably by balancing neuro-endocrinal axis.

24286340	Iyengar yoga therapy as an intervention for cramp management in individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: three case reports.	OBJECTIVES: Patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease of motor neurons, experience cramps at all stages of the illness. There is, at present, no effective medication to control the cramps and no agreement on how to treat the symptom in ALS patients. SUBJECTS: Three individuals who were diagnosed with ALS and reported suffering cramps in various parts of the body, which limited their activities or affected their sleep were invited to try Iyengar yoga. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: Yoga therapy, composed of stretching, breathing, and relaxation exercises, was prescribed for each case, based on the subject's physical disability and the presence of other symptoms. Although two subjects experienced cramps during the first therapy session, all three subjects reported the complete cessation of cramping within 3 weeks to 8 weeks of therapy. One of the subjects developed cramps in the hand after discontinuing yoga therapy for 7 months. However, the symptom stopped within 2 weeks of resuming yoga therapy. CONCLUSION: The alleviation of cramps in these three subjects indicates the possibility of yogic intervention for the management of cramps in individuals with ALS, but further research is necessary to understand the effectiveness of yoga therapy and to determine the exercises that are more prone to lead to cramping in some ALS individuals.

24282431	Physical demand profiles of hatha yoga postures performed by older adults.	Understanding the physical demands placed upon the musculoskeletal system by individual postures may allow experienced instructors and therapists to develop safe and effective yoga programs which reduce undesirable side effects. Thus, we used biomechanical methods to quantify the lower extremity joint angles, joint moments of force, and muscle activities of 21 Hatha yoga postures, commonly used in senior yoga programs. Twenty older adults, 70.7 years +/- 3.8 years, participated in a 32-wk yoga class (2 d/wk) where they learned introductory and intermediate postures (asanas). They then performed the asanas in a motion analysis laboratory. Kinematic, kinetic, and electromyographic data was collected over three seconds while the participants held the poses statically. Profiles illustrating the postures and including the biomechanical data were then generated for each asana. Our findings demonstrated that Hatha yoga postures engendered a range of appreciable joint angles, JMOFs, and muscle activities about the ankle, knee, and hip, and that demands associated with some postures and posture modifications were not always intuitive. They also demonstrated that all of the postures elicited appreciable rectus abdominis activity, which was up to 70% of that induced during walking.

24281065	Segmental and prosodic effects on intervocalic voiced stop reduction in connected speech.	De scriptions of lenition have often assumed that connected speech reductions are the phonetic precursors of phonological lenition processes. In this article, production of intervocalic voiced stops during reading in American English is examined to determine whether connected speech reduction processes mirror the stages of lenition that have been posited in the phonological literature. The first result shows that American English speakers never lenite to fricatives or debuccalize to [h] or glottal stop, but rather produce approximants whenever reduction occurs. Second, stress plays an essential role: 51% of stops are produced as approximants when stress is on the preceding syllable (e.g. 'yoga'), but only 7% of stops weaken when stress is on the following syllable (e.g. 'lagoon'). Approximant productions are longer and higher in intensity than stop productions when stress precedes the target consonant, but when stress follows the target consonant, the stop cues are enhanced. These acoustic findings suggest that English speakers prioritize the realization of acoustic cues to stress, including the robust production of stop consonants, over pressures to reduce or weaken consonants in intervocalic position.

24280463	Effect of community-based yoga intervention on oxidative stress and glycemic parameters in prediabetes: a randomized controlled trial.	OBJECTIVES: To study the effectiveness of yoga intervention on oxidative stress, glycemic status, blood pressure and anthropometry in prediabetes. DESIGN: Randomized-controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty nine prediabetes subjects aged 30-75 years. SETTING: Yoga was conducted at 4 different community diabetes clinics in Mangalore, India. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to either 3-month yoga or wait-list control groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Malondialdehyde, glutathione, vitamin C, vitamin E, superoxide dismutase, plasma glucose, glycated haemoglobin, BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio and blood pressure. RESULTS: Yoga intervention resulted in a significant decline in malondialdehyde (p<0.001), relative to the control group. In comparison with the control, there was a significant improvement in BMI, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure and fasting glucose levels at follow-up. No significant improvement in glycated haemoglobin, waist-to-hip ratio or any of the antioxidants was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga intervention may be helpful in control of oxidative stress in prediabetes subjects. Yoga can also be beneficial in reduction in BMI, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure and fasting glucose. Effect of yoga on antioxidant parameters was not evident in this study. The findings of this study need to be confirmed in larger trials involving active control groups.	Hegde, Shreelaxmi V;Adhikari, Prabha;Shetty, Sowmya;Manjrekar, Poornima;D'Souza, Vivian	2013 Dec
24278789	Tai Chi Exercise to Improve Non-Motor Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease.	BACKGROUND: A substantial number of individuals with Parkinson's disease exhibit debilitating non-motor symptoms that decrease quality of life. To date, few treatment options exist for the non-motor symptomatology related to Parkinson's disease. The goal of this pilot investigation was to determine the effects of Tai Chi exercise on the non-motor symptomology in Parkinson's disease. METHODS: Twenty-one individuals with Parkinson's disease were enrolled in a Tai Chi intervention (n=15) or a noncontact control group (n=6). Participants assigned to Tai Chi participated in 60-minute Tai Chi sessions three times per week, for 16 weeks. Pre and post measures included indices of cognitive-executive function including visuomotor tracking and attention, selective attention, working memory, inhibition, processing speed and task switching. Additionally, all participants were evaluated on the Parkinson's disease Questionnaire-39 and Tinetti's Falls Efficacy Scale. RESULTS: Results indicated that the Tai Chi training group had significantly better scores following the intervention than the control group on the Parkinson's disease Questionnaire-39 total score as well as the emotional well-being sub score. Trends for improvement were noted for the Tai Chi group on Digits Backwards, Tinetti's Falls Efficacy Scale, and the activities of daily living and communication sub scores of the Parkinson's disease Questionnaire-39. CONCLUSIONS: This research provides initial data that supports future studies to definitively establish efficacy of Tai Chi to improve non-motor features of Parkinson's disease.

24269526	Assessing for unique immunomodulatory and neuroplastic profiles of physical activity subtypes: a focus on psychiatric disorders.	Physical activity (PA) is emerging as a safe and effective tool in the prevention and treatment of psychiatric disorders. PA subtypes include aerobic, resistance, flexibility, neuromotor (involving balance, agility and co-ordination), mind-body (e.g. tai chi, qi gong and yoga) and mixed type trainings. Evidence from clinical trials suggests that PA subtypes can have positive clinical effects, however the effects on the symptomatology may vary according to the PA subtype. It therefore stands to reason that various PA subtypes may modulate the immune system and neuroplastic processes differently. This systematic review aims to assess the immunomodulatory and neuroplastic profiles of various PA subtypes, particularly in unipolar depression and age-related cognitive decline (ARCD). The literature suggests several unique immunomodulatory and neuroplastic profiles for PA subtypes (i.e. resistance, aerobic and mind-body) in depression and ARCD. In depression, levels of various cytokines at baseline may predict treatment response to subtypes of PA and pharmacological agents. The pro-neuroplastic effects of resistance and aerobic PA in ARCD may differ due to variances in neurotrophin profiles. At this stage of literature in the field, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions on the specific immunomodulatory and neuroplastic pathways involved in these PA subtypes given of the small number of comparative studies and methodological heterogeneity between studies (e.g. study population age and illness severity, as well as duration and intensity of PA intervention). This important field requires well-designed, high-quality comparative studies to better describe unique immunomodulatory and neuroplastic profiles.	Eyre, Harris A;Baune, Bernhard T	2014 Jul
24263878	[The effects of hatha yoga exercises on stress and anxiety levels in mastectomized women].	This article seeks to evaluate the effects of hatha yoga on stress and anxiety levels in mastectomized women. It also investigates the relationship between these levels with the following variables: age; marital status; religion; instruction; profession; smoke addiction; elitism; staging of the disease; and treatment phase. This involved controlled random clinical trial sampling of 45 mastectomized women treated at the Ilza Bianco outpatient service of Santa Rita de Cassia Hospital in the Brazilian state of Espirito Santo from March to November 2010. The experimental group participated in 6 individually-applied sessions with incentive for ongoing home practice and was re-evaluated after the period, whereas the control group was re-evaluated after a proportional period. For the study of the variables, the interview and recording on a form technique was used, along with the Anxiety Trait and State Test, and the Stress Symptoms and Signs Test. For statistical treatment, the Statistical Pack for Social Sciences was used. The data are statistically significant and have shown that hatha yoga exercises decrease stress and anxiety in the experimental group. No connection between confounding variables and anxiety and stress levels was found.

24251291	Yoga improves attention and self-esteem in underprivileged girl student.	BACKGROUND: A student under optimal stress does bring out his or her best; however, extreme stress can result in mental health problems and deteriorates their academic performance. Students who esteem themselves low are most likely to engage in destructive and self-destructive behaviors. Moreover, excessive stress is harmful to academic performance and may lead to dropping out in student. Can Yoga be of benefit in students for improving their attention and self-esteem (SE)? OBJECTIVE: To assess attention and SE in girls undergoing Integrated Yoga Module (IYM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty low-income high school girls with 15.17 + 0.64 years of mean age participated in this single group pre-post study. The data was collected before and after 5 days of IYM. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Means, standard deviations, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and Wilcoxon signed rank test were used to analyze the data with the help of SPSS 16. RESULTS: The data analysis showed 9.04% increase (P = 0.001) in SE scores, whereas d2 test for attention revealed 10.12% increase (P < 0.001) in total number of symbols processed scores and 44.73% decrease (P < 0.001) in total number of errors. CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that of IYM can result in improvement of attention and SE among students and thereby enhancing their mental health and can help them in improving their academic achievement. Efforts aimed at reducing mental health problems among students may focus more on implementing effective and culturally acceptable interventions, such as Yoga, counseling, and social support. Additional well-designed studies are needed before a strong recommendation can be made.	Sethi, Jaspal Kaur;Nagendra, H R;Sham Ganpat, Tikhe	2013
24246140	Laughing: a demanding exercise for trunk muscles.	Social, psychological, and physiological studies have provided evidence indicating that laughter imposes an increased demand on trunk muscles. It was the aim of this study to quantify the activation of trunk muscles during laughter yoga in comparison with crunch and back lifting exercises regarding the mean trunk muscle activity. Muscular activity during laughter yoga exercises was measured by surface electromyography of 5 trunk muscles. The activation level of internal oblique muscle during laughter yoga is higher compared to the traditional exercises. The multifidus, erector spinae, and rectus abdominis muscles were nearly half activated during laughter yoga, while the activation of the external oblique muscle was comparable with the crunch and back lifting exercises. Our results indicate that laughter yoga has a positive effect on trunk muscle activation. Thus, laughter seems to be a good activator of trunk muscles, but further research is required whether laughter yoga is a good exercise to improve neuromuscular recruitment patterns for spine stability.

24236181	Role of exercise in the management of diabetes mellitus: the global scenario.	BACKGROUND: Exercise training programs have emerged as a useful therapeutic regimen for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Majority of the Western studies highlighted the effective role of exercise in T2DM. Therefore, the main aim was to focus on the extent, type of exercise and its clinical significance in T2DM in order to educate the clinicians from developing countries, especially in Asians. METHODS: Pubmed, Science Direct, Scopus, ISI Web of Knowledge and Google scholar were searched using the terms "type 2 diabetes mellitus," "type 2 DM," "exercise," and/or "physical activity," and "type 2 diabetes mellitus with exercise." Only clinical or human studies published in English language between 2000 and 2012 were included. Certain criteria were assigned to achieve appropriate results. RESULTS: Twenty five studies met the selected criteria. The majority of the studies were randomized controlled trial study design (65%). Most of the aerobic exercise based studies showed a beneficial effect in T2DM. Resistance exercise also proved to have positive effect on T2DM patients. Minimal studies related to other types of exercises such as yoga classes, joba riding and endurance-type exercise were found. On the other hand, United States of America (USA) showed strong interest of exercise management towards T2DM. CONCLUSION: Aerobic exercise is more common in clinical practice compared to resistance exercise in managing T2DM. Treatment of T2DM with exercise training showed promising role in USA. A large number of researches are mandatory in the developing countries for incorporating exercise in the effective management of T2DM.	Thent, Zar Chi;Das, Srijit;Henry, Leonard Joseph	2013
24229658	What is the role of alternative treatments in late-life depression?	Late-life depression remains challenging to treat. One major limitation to treatment is the concern over medication-related side effects to which the elderly are especially vulnerable. Also, because many elderly people are already taking multiple medications for medical conditions, there is the concern over drug-drug interactions. This article reviews various complementary and alternative medicine interventions for late-life depression, including natural remedies, exercise, yoga, tai chi, massage therapy, music therapy, and religion and spirituality.

24224228	A systematic review of yoga for state anxiety: considerations for occupational therapy.	BACKGROUND: State anxiety can result from a variety of life situations. This type of anxiety can disrupt occupational engagement and performance, thereby affecting rehabilitation and recovery. Occupational therapists need to address the connection between mind-body-spirit and its relationship to performance and engagement in meaningful occupations. Yoga, when used as an adjunct to therapy, has the potential to address state anxiety. PURPOSE: The aim was to systematically review the evidence concerning the effectiveness of yoga as a treatment approach for state anxiety. METHODS: Six electronic databases, the authors' own files, and the references of included studies from 1990 to July 2011 were searched. FINDINGS: A total of 25 unique studies represented by 26 publications made up the sample: two systematic reviews; 16 randomized controlled trials, and seven prospective, controlled, non-randomized studies. Evidence suggests yoga can be a viable therapeutic option for reducing state anxiety in certain situations. IMPLICATIONS: In making the determination to recommend yoga as an intervention, occupational therapists should consider the client's circumstances and values as well as the type and intensity of the yoga program.

24215858	Menopausal quality of life: RCT of yoga, exercise, and omega-3 supplements.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of 3 nonhormonal therapies for the improvement of menopause-related quality of life in women with vasomotor symptoms. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a 12-week 3 x 2 randomized, controlled, factorial design trial. Peri- and postmenopausal women, 40-62 years old, were assigned randomly to yoga (n = 107), exercise (n = 106), or usual activity (n = 142) and also assigned randomly to a double-blind comparison of omega-3 (n = 177) or placebo (n = 178) capsules. We performed the following interventions: (1) weekly 90-minute yoga classes with daily at-home practice, (2) individualized facility-based aerobic exercise training 3 times/week, and (3) 0.615 g omega-3 supplement, 3 times/day. The outcomes were assessed with the following scores: Menopausal Quality of Life Questionnaire (MENQOL) total and domain (vasomotor symptoms, psychosocial, physical and sexual). RESULTS: Among 355 randomly assigned women who average age was 54.7 years, 338 women (95%) completed 12-week assessments. Mean baseline vasomotor symptoms frequency was 7.6/day, and the mean baseline total MENQOL score was 3.8 (range, 1-8 from better to worse) with no between-group differences. For yoga compared to usual activity, baseline to 12-week improvements were seen for MENQOL total -0.3 (95% confidence interval, -0.6 to 0; P = .02), vasomotor symptom domain (P = .02), and sexuality domain (P = .03) scores. For women who underwent exercise and omega-3 therapy compared with control subjects, improvements in baseline to 12-week total MENQOL scores were not observed. Exercise showed benefit in the MENQOL physical domain score at 12 weeks (P = .02). CONCLUSION: All women become menopausal, and many of them seek medical advice on ways to improve quality of life; little evidence-based information exists. We found that, among healthy sedentary menopausal women, yoga appears to improve menopausal quality of life; the clinical significance of our finding is uncertain because of the modest effect.

24199979	Effect of integrated yoga on anxiety, depression & well being in normal pregnancy.	OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of integrated yoga on Pregnancy experience, anxiety, and depression in normal pregnancy. METHODS: This Prospective Randomized control study recruited 96 women in 20th week of normal pregnancy. Yoga group (n = 51) practiced integrated yoga and control group (n = 45) did standard antenatal exercises, one hour daily, from 20th to 36th week of gestation. Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon's tests were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: There was significant difference between groups (Mann-Whitney p < 0.001) in all variables. There were significant changes within groups (Wilcoxon's p < 0.001) in both groups. Pregnancy related experience (PEQ) reduced in yoga by 26.86%, State (STAI I) anxiety (decreased 15.65% in yoga, increased 13.76% in control), Trait (STAI II) anxiety (decreased 8.97% in yoga, increased 5.02% in control) and Depression (HADS) (decreased 30.67% in yoga, increased 3.57% in control). CONCLUSION: Yoga reduces anxiety, depression and pregnancy related uncomfortable experiences.	Satyapriya, M;Nagarathna, R;Padmalatha, V;Nagendra, H R	2013 Nov
24199978	Yoga therapy for breast cancer patients: a prospective cohort study.	We sought to study the impact of yoga therapy on anxiety, depression and physical health in breast cancer patients. Stage I-III post-operative breast cancer patients were recruited with twelve 1-h weekly yoga sessions completed with an experienced yoga instructor. Before and after each module completion, assessments were obtained with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS), the Dallas pain scale and shoulder flexibility measurements. Fourteen patients completed the entire yoga session with 42.8% having a total mastectomy and 15.4% having breast reconstruction. Both right and left shoulder abduction flexibility significantly improved (p = 0.004; p = 0.015 respectively) as well as left shoulder flexion (p = 0.046). An improvement trend in scores for the HADS and Dallas questionnaires pre- and post-intervention was found, although it was not statistically significant. Our data indicates an improvement in physical function in addition to a consistent amelioration in anxiety, depression and pain symptoms after a yoga intervention.

24199742	Effect of yoga or physical exercise on physical, cognitive and emotional measures in children: a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Previous studies have separately reported the effects of physical exercise and yoga in children, showing physical, cognitive and emotional benefits. OBJECTIVES: The present randomized controlled trial assessed the effects of yoga or physical exercise on physical fitness, cognitive performance, self-esteem, and teacher-rated behavior and performance, in school children. METHODS: 98 school children between 8 to 13 years were randomized as yoga and physical exercise groups {n = 49 each; (yoga: 15 girls, group mean age 10.4 +/- 1.2 years), (physical exercise: 23 girls, group mean age 10.5 +/- 1.3 years)}. Both groups were blind assessed after allocation, using: (i) the Eurofit physical fitness test battery, (ii) Stroop color-word task for children, (iii) Battle's self-esteem inventory and (iv) the teachers' rating of the children's obedience, academic performance, attention, punctuality, and behavior with friends and teachers. After assessments the yoga group practiced yoga (breathing techniques, postures, guided relaxation and chanting), 45 minutes each day, 5 days a week. During this time the physical exercise group had jogging-in-place, rapid repetitive movements and relay races or games. Both groups were assessed at the end of 3 months. Data were analyzed with RM ANOVA and post-hoc tests were Bonferroni adjusted. RESULTS: There was one significant difference between groups. This was in social self-esteem which was higher after physical exercise compared to yoga (p < 0.05). All the changes reported below are based on after-before comparisons, within each group. Both groups showed an increase in BMI, and number of sit-ups (p < 0.001). Balance worsened in the physical exercise group, while plate tapping improved in the yoga group (p < 0.001). In the Stroop task both groups showed improved color, word- and color-word naming (p < 0.01), while the physical exercise group showed higher interference scores. Total, general and parental self-esteem improved in the yoga group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Yoga and physical exercise are useful additions to the school routine, with physical exercise improving social self-esteem. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered in the Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI/2012/11/003112).

24173693	Yoga in rheumatic diseases.	Yoga is a popular activity which may be well suited to some individuals with specific rheumatic disorders. Regular yoga practice can increase muscle strength and endurance, proprioception, and balance, with emphasis on movement through a full range of motion to increase flexibility and mobility. Additional beneficial elements of yoga include breathing, relaxation, body awareness, and meditation, which can reduce stress and anxiety and promote a sense of calmness, general well-being, and improved quality of life. Yoga also encourages a meditative focus, increased body awareness and mindfulness; some evidence suggests yoga may help reduce inflammatory mediators including C-reactive protein and interleukin-6. Yoga is best learned under the supervision of qualified teachers who are well informed about the potential musculoskeletal needs of each individual. Here, we briefly review the literature on yoga for healthy, musculoskeletal, and rheumatic disease populations and offer recommendations for discussing ways to begin yoga with patients.

24167339	Capacity building of AYUSH practitioners to study the feasibility of their involvement in non-communicable disease prevention and control.	BACKGROUND: Sharing of public health knowledge and skills by professionals in allopathic system of medicine with Ayurveda, Yoga, and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) professionals in India has always been considered as part of integrating the health system in India. But till date, a curriculum has not been framed for follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A training course was developed for AYUSH professionals in India on the public health principles for the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Three course chairs interacted with international and national public health and AYUSH experts, and the curriculum for a 3-month course was developed. RESULTS: The curriculum comprised interactive lectures, problem-based exercise, field visits, and research protocol development. A total of four participants, nominated by the World Health Organization, India, were trained during the course, with significant (P = 0.00) improvement in knowledge from 53.2 to 80.0 points. CONCLUSION: A novel and feasible public health course for complementary and alternative medicine professionals on the public health principles for NCDs' prevention and control is needed to bridge the demand gap for public health professionals in India.

24167333	Comparison of effect of Gayatri Mantra and Poem Chanting on Digit Letter Substitution Task.	CONTEXT: Attention is one of the components to enhance academic excellence. Traditional techniques were included in Indian schools to develop mental faculties with a view to add value to the latter. AIM: The aim was to evaluate the effects of Gayatri mantra (GM) chanting on attention as measured by digit-letter substitution task (DLST). SETTINGS AND DESIGN: School setting and self as control study design. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects consisted of 60 school students included (boys = 30 and girls = 30) in the age range of 12-14 years, who were trained for chanting GM for 5 days. They were assessed on DLST immediately before and after two sessions (i) GM chanting (10 min) and (ii) Poem line (PL) chanting with an equal duration (10 min). Fifty percent of participants performed GM chanting and remaining on the PL recitation on day 6. The orders of the sessions were reversed on day 7. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Repeated measure analysis of variance with Bonferroni adjustment used. RESULTS: Both sessions showed significant improvement in the total and net score of DLST. The magnitude of net score improvement was greater after GM (21.67%) compared to PL (4.85%). Female group had found better performance following GM compared to PL chanting. CONCLUSIONS: Both GM and PL led to improvement in performance, as assessed by DLST. But the influence of GM had significantly higher than PL in net score of female group.

24166108	"I am a nice person when I do yoga!!!" A qualitative analysis of how yoga affects relationships.	PURPOSE: To develop a better understanding of how yoga practice affects one's interpersonal relationships. DESIGN: Qualitative. METHOD: Content analysis was used to qualitatively analyze written comments (n = 171) made regarding yoga improving interpersonal relationships in a large cross-sectional survey of yoga practitioners (N = 1,067). FINDINGS: Four themes were identified: Yoga practice leads to personal transformation, increases social interaction, provides coping mechanisms to weather relationship losses and difficulties, and leads to spiritual transcendence. Practitioners believed that their interpersonal relationships improved because their attitude and perspective had changed, making them more patient, kind, mindful, and self-aware. They expressed an aspect of community that was both practical (they met new friends) and spiritual (they felt they belonged). They thought they could better weather difficulties such as divorce and death. A number discussed feeling a sense of purpose and that their practice contributed to a greater good. CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be an aspect of community associated with yoga practice that may be beneficial to one's social and spiritual health. Yoga could be beneficial for populations at risk for social isolation, such as those who are elderly, bereaved, and depressed, as well as individuals undergoing interpersonal crises.

24165529	Joint ventures: helping those with rheumatoid arthritis live well.	OBJECTIVES: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune, chronic inflammatory disorder that causes pain, swelling, stiffness, loss of joint function, and reduced quality of life. Yoga therapy may help individuals with RA manage stress and increase well-being. This study focused on the identification of therapeutic objectives and a methodology to achieve symptom relief, regain function, and enhance quality of life for individuals with RA. METHODS: Four women with RA participated in private yoga therapy sessions for 2.5 months. Assessment based, tailored home practices were developed and modified to address participant - identified goals. RESULTS: Participants reported decreased pain, fatigue, swelling, and flares; increased energy; pain-free range of motion and strength around affected joints; and a heightened sense of well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Tailored yoga therapy that emphasizes stress reduction may be beneficial for individuals with RA.	Stewart, Aggie	2013
24165528	Translating knowledge: a framework for evidence-informed yoga programs in oncology.	Empirical research suggests that yoga may positively influence the negative psychosocial and physical side effects associated with cancer and its treatment. The translation of these findings into sustainable, evidence-informed yoga programming for cancer survivors has lagged behind the research. This article provides (a) an overview of the yoga and cancer research, (b) a framework for successfully developing and delivering yoga to cancer populations, and (c) an example of a successful community-based program. The importance of continued research and knowledge translation efforts in the context of yoga and integrative oncology are highlighted.

24165527	The benefits of yoga for adults with type 2 diabetes: a review of the evidence and call for a collaborative, integrated research initiative.	Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a global public health crisis. Research suggests that yoga holds promise for T2DM management. This article summarizes evidence regarding the efficacy of yoga for T2DM management and encourages the development of an integrated research agenda and a collaborative work group to test it. We present a brief overview of the global rise in T2DM and its consequences and costs, review the evidence regarding the potential benefits of yoga for T2DM management, outline limitations in the literature, discuss possible mechanisms underlying the effects of yoga on T2DM, and suggest how a collaborative, multinational effort by yoga therapist and research communities might contribute to research and inform clinical practice. Yoga protocols that serve T2DM patients and a research framework for creating an evidence base to support the use of yoga for T2DM management are clearly needed.	de G R Hansen, Elizabeth;Innes, Kim E	2013

24165524	Hatha yoga practice for type 2 diabetes mellitus patients: a pilot study.	OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to examine the impact of Hatha yoga on glycemic control, psychological and physiological stress, and self-care for individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: Ten sedentary individuals with T2DM who were non-insulin dependent, free of diabetes-related complications, and had no previous yoga experience completed therapeutic yoga classes for 6 weeks, 3 times per week . Glycemic control measures included fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, and fasting insulin. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Perceived Stress Scale, and salivary cortisol were used to assess levels of stress, and the Summary of Diabetes Self-care Activities questionnaire was used to assess regimen adherence. RESULTS: No significant changes in glucose control or physiological stress were found; however, significant changes in perceived stress, state anxiety, and self-care behaviors were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings support further investigation of the benefits of Hatha yoga as a complementary therapy for those with T2DM.	Vizcaino, Maricarmen	2013
24165523	Discrepancies between perceptions of real and ideal yoga teachers and their relationship to emotional well-being.	OBJECTIVES: Although more individuals are adopting yoga into their lives, little research has examined practitioners' expectations and experiences of their yoga instructor's behavior. Discrepancies between real and ideal behaviors of yoga instructors may lead to unsatisfactory experiences and decrease the potential impact of yoga practice. This study investigated differences between yoga practitioners' real and ideal perceptions of their yoga teacher's behavior and the relationship between discrepant beliefs and students' symptoms of depression, anxiety,and stress. METHODS: The Perceptions of Yoga Teacher Questionnaire (PYTQ), a recently developed survey of student attitudes regarding yoga teachers' behavior, was administered ina national online survey of yoga students and teachers. Greater discrepancy between real and idea yoga teacher behavior was anticipated to be positively associated with practitioners' symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. RESULTS: Pearson correlations corrected for multiple comparisons revealed that yoga students and teachers are generally satisfied with their teacher's behaviors. Significant discrepancies between real and ideal teacher behavior were found for both groups. Higher discrepancy scores were associated with symptoms of stress and anxiety but not depression for students, but not for teachers. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings provide insight into the relationship between expectancies and real yoga teacher behaviors and their links to student emotional adjustment.More research in this area is warranted.

24165522	The effects of yoga on eating disorder symptoms and correlates: a review.	BACKGROUND: Yoga is a popular adjunct therapy for eating disorders (EDs). A systematic review and synthesis of the yoga literature is needed to guide treatment recommendations and future research. This article provides a review of studies that used yoga for preventing and treating EDs. METHOD: Databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles about yoga practice and ED symptoms and correlates. RESULTS: Of the 14 articles reviewed, 40% used cross-sectional designs to examine risk and protective factors for EDs among yoga practitioners, and 60% used longitudinal designs to assess the effectiveness of yoga interventions for preventing and treating EDs. Yoga practitioners were reported to be at decreased risk for EDs, and ED risk and symptoms were reduced or unchanged after yoga interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Well-controlled studies are needed to understand whether the positive effects of yoga on ED symptoms and correlates are related to the type of yoga practiced, the amount/frequency of practice, and/or other variables.

24165521	Effects of a 4-month Ananda Yoga program on physical and mental health outcomes for persons with multiple sclerosis.	OBJECTIVES: Yoga has been found to be effective for addressing problems with strength, flexibility, balance, gait, anxiety, depression, and concentration. Varying degrees of these problems occur in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS). This study examined the effects of a comprehensive, 4-month yoga program on strength, mobility, balance, respiratory function, and quality of life for individuals with MS. METHODS: Twenty four individuals with MS participated in an intensive Ananda Yoga training followed by 17 weeks of home practice. RESULTS: Significant improvements in functional strength, balance, and peak expiratory flow and a trend toward improvements in mental health and quality of life outcomes were detected following the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this exploratory study suggest that yoga can have a positive impact on physical functioning and quality of life for persons with mild to moderate MS.

24165520	iRest yoga-nidra on the college campus: changes in stress, depression, worry, and mindfulness.	OBJECTIVES: There is evidence that yoga practice is associated with decreased stress, worry, and depression, and with improved mindfulness-based skills. These findings had not been previously replicated for a sample of college students. This study evaluated whether iRest yoga-nidra practice was associated with reduced perceived stress, worry, and depression, and increased mindfulness in a sample of college student s. METHODS: Sixty-six students age 18-56 completed an 8-week iRest yoga-nidra intervention that was offered for 8 semesters. Assessment occurred 1 week prior to intervention onset and during the class period following the intervention. Qualitative data were collected at Weeks 4 and 8. RESULTS: Statistically significant pre- to posttest improvements in perceived stress, worry, and depression were found. Pre-existing depression accounted for most of the change in worry and perceived stress scores. Pre- to post test improvements in mindfulness-based skills were also detected. CONCLUSIONS: iRest yoga-nidra practice may reduce symptoms of perceived stress, worry, and depression and increase mindfulness-based skills.

24163186	Yoga and psychophysiological determinants of cardiovascular health: comparing yoga practitioners, runners, and sedentary individuals.	BACKGROUND: The evidence of cardiovascular benefits of yoga is promising, but lacks demonstrations of specificity compared to other interventions. PURPOSE: The present cross-sectional study examined cardiovascular health markers in long-term practitioners of yoga (yogis), runners, and sedentary individuals. METHODS: We compared physiological, psychological, and lifestyle variables associated with cardiovascular health across groups. RESULTS: Yogis (n = 47) and runners (n = 46) showed favorable profiles compared to sedentary individuals (n = 52) on heart rate, heart rate variability, depression, perceived stress, and cigarette smoking. Runners and male yogis showed superior aerobic fitness compared to the sedentary group. Runners reported greater social support compared to other groups. Yogis demonstrated a lower respiration rate compared to sedentary individuals and were more likely to refrain from eating meat compared to other groups. CONCLUSIONS: Yogis and runners demonstrated several cardiovascular health advantages over sedentary individuals. Our findings raise the possibility that yoga may improve aerobic fitness in men but not women.	Satin, Jillian R;Linden, Wolfgang;Millman, Roanne D	2014 Apr
24157260	Effects of a health care provider intervention in reduction of sexual risk and related outcomes in economically marginal communities in Mumbai, India.	BACKGROUND: The present study assessed the effectiveness of a brief narrative intervention implemented by trained biomedical and Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy (AYUSH) providers from three low-income communities in Mumbai, India. METHODS: A quasi-experimental research design compared attitudinal and behavioural changes among a cohort of 554 patients presenting gupt rog ('secret sexual illnesses') to biomedical and AYUSH providers who were trained in the narrative intervention model (NIM; referred to as 'narrative prevention counseling' in the intervention manual) with those providing standard care (untrained in NIM). Data were analysed using multivariate and longitudinal statistical models. RESULTS: Patients who received treatment for gupt rog from trained providers reported receiving a significantly higher number of services than those receiving services from untrained providers (mean 8.9 vs 7.6 services, respectively; P<0.001). In addition, a higher number of patients seeing the trained providers no longer had gupt rog problems than those seeing untrained providers (42% vs 25%, respectively; P<0.001). Patient-reported sex with a partner who was not the wife decreased significantly from baseline to follow-up for the entire sample but was significantly greater among patients receiving treatment from trained AYUSH providers (from 27% at baseline to 2% at follow up) compared with untrained providers (from 18% at baseline to 5% at follow up; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results support the effectiveness of brief narrative intervention in primary care settings for reducing sexual risk and associated vulnerabilities among married men.

24156771	Hemodynamic observations of tumo yoga practitioners in a Himalayan environment.	BACKGROUND: Few attempts have been made to evaluate the physiology of traditional Eastern health practices. The goal of this study was to evaluate the hemodynamic effects of the mysterious Buddhist practice of tumo. Tumo is a meditative practice that produces inner heat through the alleged cultivation of body energy-channels. METHODS: This study was performed by members of an international expedition to the Himalayan Mountains in the Republic of India. The study was performed in an unpopulated outdoor mountainous area at an altitude of 16,400 ft with ambient temperatures between -10 and -15( degrees )C. Two (2) cohorts of subjects were studied: healthy non-yogi volunteers and tumo practitioners. All of the subjects were stripped down to their underclothes and exposed to the subzero atmospheric temperatures for 5 minutes. The volunteers were then passively rewarmed while the tumo practitioners performed tumo for up to 10 minutes. Blood pressure, heart rate, and stroke volume index (SVI) and cardiac index were measured noninvasively using a NICOM hemodynamic monitor, while carotid blood flow and biventricular performance were determined echocardiographically at each stage of the experiment. The total peripheral resistance index (TPRI), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) were determined using standard formula. RESULTS: Fourteen (14) subjects (six volunteers and eight tumo practitioners) completed the study. There was one female subject in each group. With cold exposure, the SVI and carotid blood flow decreased while the TPRI increased significantly in both groups. In the volunteer group, these changes retuned to baseline with rewarming. Following tumo, the cardiac index (4.8+/-0.6 versus 4.0+/-0.5 l/m(2); p<0.01), carotid blood flow (445+/-127 versus 325+/-100 mL/min/m(2), p<0.01), LVEF (68+/-5 versus 64+/-7%; p<0.05) and TAPSE (2.9+/-0.4 versus 2.4+/-0.5 cm; p<0.01) were significantly higher when compared with baseline, while the TPRI was significantly lower (1786+/-189 versus 2173+/-281; p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Tumo was associated with a hyperdynamic vasodilated state with increased biventricular performance. We postulate that tumo results in a massive increase in sympathetic activity with activation of brown adipose tissue and marked heat production. The increased heat production may explain the paradoxical vasodilatation in tumo practitioners exposed to subzero temperatures.

24146758	Adverse events associated with yoga: a systematic review of published case reports and case series.	While yoga is gaining increased popularity in North America and Europe, its safety has been questioned in the lay press. The aim of this systematic review was to assess published case reports and case series on adverse events associated with yoga. Medline/Pubmed, Scopus, CAMBase, IndMed and the Cases Database were screened through February 2013; and 35 case reports and 2 case series reporting a total of 76 cases were included. Ten cases had medical preconditions, mainly glaucoma and osteopenia. Pranayama, hatha yoga, and Bikram yoga were the most common yoga practices; headstand, shoulder stand, lotus position, and forceful breathing were the most common yoga postures and breathing techniques cited. Twenty-seven adverse events (35.5%) affected the musculoskeletal system; 14 (18.4%) the nervous system; and 9 (11.8%) the eyes. Fifteen cases (19.7%) reached full recovery; 9 cases (11.3%) partial recovery; 1 case (1.3%) no recovery; and 1 case (1.3%) died. As any other physical or mental practice, yoga should be practiced carefully under the guidance of a qualified instructor. Beginners should avoid extreme practices such as headstand, lotus position and forceful breathing. Individuals with medical preconditions should work with their physician and yoga teacher to appropriately adapt postures; patients with glaucoma should avoid inversions and patients with compromised bone should avoid forceful yoga practices.

24144569	Meeting the public health challenge of pain in later life: what role can senior centers play?	Interest in nonpharmacologic approaches for managing pain continues to grow. The aim of this study was to determine the types of pain-relevant programs offered by senior centers and whether the programs varied by clients' race/ethnicity status and center size. A telephone survey was conducted. Respondents were presented with a list of 15 programs and the option to choose "other" and asked (1) whether the activity was offered and, if so, how often; (2) if they believed the programs had value for seniors with pain; and (3) whether the classes were advertised as a means of achieving pain relief. Of 204 center staff contacted, 195 (95.6%) participated. The most common programs offered were movement-based, including exercise (by 91.8% of the centers), dance (72.3%), walking clubs (71.8%), yoga (65.6%), and Tai Chi (53.3%) classes. Creative arts programs were also frequently offered, including music (58.5%) and fine arts (47.7%). Programs such as stress management (27%) and relaxation (26%) classes were less commonly offered. Most respondents identified movement-based programs as helpful for seniors with pain, but few identified creative arts classes as potentially beneficial. The programs/classes offered were infrequently advertised as a means of helping seniors manage pain and varied by clients' race/ethnicity status and center size. Programs that have potential utility for older adults with pain are commonly offered by senior centers. Future research should determine optimal strategies for engaging older adults in these programs in the senior center setting.

24139017	'The core': understanding it, and retraining its dysfunction.	"Core stability training" is popular in both the therapeutic and fitness industries but what is actually meant and understood by this concept? And does everyone need the same training approach? This paper examines the landscape of 'the core' and its control from both a clinical and research perspective. It attempts a comprehensive review of its healthy functional role and how this is commonly changed in people with spinal and pelvic girdle pain syndromes. The common clinically observable and palpable patterns of functional and structural change associated with 'problems with the core' have been relatively little described. This paper endeavors to do so, introducing a variant paradigm aimed at promoting the understanding and management of these altered patterns of 'core control'. Clinically, two basic subgroups emerge. In light of these, the predictable difficulties that each group finds in establishing the important fundamental elements of spino-pelvic 'core control' and how to best retrain these, are highlighted. The integrated model presented is applicable for practitioners re-educating movement in physiotherapy, rehabilitation, Pilates, Yoga or injury prevention within the fitness industry in general.

24139005	The immediate effects of modified Yoga positions on musculoskeletal pain relief.	Many musculoskeletal pains are related to poor posture. Thus, the aim of the present study was to assess the efficiency of a single session of two modified Yoga positions with 110 subjects and their 147 pain-related complaints. The participants were divided into two groups: The Yoga Group, which received treatment of two 20-min postures and the Control Group, which received a placebo treatment of 15 min with a turned off ultrasound. All volunteers experienced some pain before treatment and were assessed before and after treatment using the analog pain scale. A score of 0 indicated no pain whereas 10 was the maximum degree of pain on the scale. The difference before and after treatment was compared between the groups with a p-value of 0.0001, as measured by the Student's t-test. It is possible to conclude that one therapy session is effective in the treatment of various musculoskeletal problems.	do Rosario, Jose Luis Pimentel;Orcesi, Larissa Schwarzwalder;Kobayashi, Fernanda Naomi;Aun, Alexandre Nicolau;Diolindo Assumpcao, Iane Tavares;Blasioli, Gisele Janaina;Hanada, Erica Sato	2013 Oct
24138996	Incorporating yoga into an intense physical therapy program in someone with Parkinson's disease: a case report.	PURPOSE: The purpose of this case report was to document outcomes following an intense exercise program integrating yoga with physical therapy exercise in a male with Parkinson's disease. METHOD: The participant performed an intense 1(1/2)-hour program (Phase A) incorporating strengthening, balance, agility and yoga exercises twice weekly for 12 weeks. He then completed a new home exercise program developed by the researchers (Phase B) for 12 weeks. RESULTS: His score on the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire improved 16 points while his score on the High Level Mobility Assessment tool improved 11 points. There were also improvements in muscle length of several lower extremity muscles, in upper and lower extremity muscle strength, in dynamic balance and he continues to work full time 29 months later. There were no improvements in thoracic posture or aerobic power. DISCUSSION: This intense program was an effective dose of exercise for someone with Parkinson's disease and allowed him to continue to participate in work, leisure, and community activities.

24138995	Improvements in glucose tolerance with Bikram Yoga in older obese adults: a pilot study.	Bikram yoga is an exotic form of physical activity combining hatha yoga and thermal therapy that could positively impact metabolic health. Although this increasingly popular alternative exercise may be ideal for obese adults due to its low impact nature, few studies have elucidated the health benefits associated with it. As an initial step, we determined the effect of Bikram yoga on glucose tolerance. Fourteen young lean and 15 older obese subjects completed an 8-week Bikram yoga intervention in which classes were completed 3 times per week. Glucose tolerance was assessed using a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. The area under the glucose curve following the oral glucose tolerance test was significantly reduced as a result of the Bikram Yoga intervention in older obese (P < 0.05) but not in young lean subjects. We concluded that a short-term Bikram yoga intervention improved glucose tolerance in older obese, but not in young lean adults.

24138994	Yoga and social support reduce prenatal depression, anxiety and cortisol.	The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of yoga (physical activity) versus social support (verbal activity) on prenatal and postpartum depression. Ninety-two prenatally depressed women were randomly assigned to a yoga or a social support control group at 22 weeks gestation. The yoga group participated in a 20-min group session (only physical poses) once per week for 12 weeks. The social support group (a leaderless discussion group) met on the same schedule. At the end of the first and last sessions the yoga group reported less depression, anxiety, anger, back and leg pain as compared to the social support group. At the end of the last session the yoga group and the support group did not differ. They both had lower depression (CES-D), anxiety (STAI), and anger (STAXI) scores and improved relationship scores. In addition, cortisol levels decreased for both groups following each session. Estriol and progesterone levels decreased after the last session. At the postpartum follow-up assessment depression and anxiety levels were lower for both groups.	Field, Tiffany;Diego, Miguel;Delgado, Jeannette;Medina, Lissette	2013 Oct

24124549	Yoga for essential hypertension: a systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Yoga is thought to be effective for health conditions. The article aims to assess the current clinical evidence of yoga for Essential hypertension (EH). STRATEGY: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library were searched until June, 2013. We included randomized clinical trials testing yoga against conventional therapy, yoga versus no treatment, yoga combined with conventional therapy versus conventional therapy or conventional therapy combined with breath awareness. Study selection, data extraction, quality assessment, and data analyses were conducted according to the Cochrane standards. RESULTS: A total of 6 studies (involving 386 patients) were included. The methodological quality of the included trials was evaluated as generally low. A total of 6 RCTs met all the inclusion criteria. 4 of them compared yoga plus conventional therapy with conventional therapy. 1 RCT described yoga combined with conventional therapy versus conventional therapy combined with breath awareness. 2 RCT tested the effect of yoga versus conventional therapy alone. 1 RCT described yoga compared to no treatment. Only one trial reported adverse events without details, the safety of yoga is still uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: There is some encouraging evidence of yoga for lowering SBP and DBP. However, due to low methodological quality of these identified trials, a definite conclusion about the efficacy and safety of yoga on EH cannot be drawn from this review. Therefore, further thorough investigation, large-scale, proper study designed, randomized trials of yoga for hypertension will be required to justify the effects reported here.

24116310	Yoga for high-risk pregnancy: a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Improvements in technology have increased the chances of survival for the micro-premature infant and the very low birth-weight infant but have significantly increased the financial burden of health care organizations. This economic burden has a significant impact on third-party payers and on society in general. AIM: The study was designed to assess yoga therapy (YT) module on maternal stress level in high risk pregnancy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In the present study, sixty-eight pregnant women (38 in the control group with standard antenatal care and 30 in the YT group) with 27.2 (5.2) years of mean age recruited from the outpatient services of medical college and hospital in Bangalore, South India, were participated. The study was a single-blind randomized controlled clinical trial. Perceived stress scale (PSS) was measured during the 12(th), 20(th), and 28(th) weeks of pregnancy. SPSS version 16.0 (Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all data analysis. When the data were found to be normally distributed, the RMANOVA were used to assess the PSS scores between the yoga and control groups. Significant values were set at P < 0.05. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the PSS level of the YT group with significantly reduced scores at the second follow-up (28(th) week of pregnancy) compared to the control group (P = 0.02). Women who took part in the YT module reported significantly fewer pregnancy discomforts decrease in PSS (P = 0.02) than the control group where the stress level was increased (RMANOVA test using SPSS-16). CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that the YT module can decrease the stress level during high-risk pregnancy complications. Thus, practicing YT during high-risk pregnancy is not only a cost-effective option but also a feasible and safe option. Additional well-designed studies are needed before a strong recommendation can be made.

24106423	Evidence for cognitive-behavioral strategies improving dyspnea and related distress in COPD.	BACKGROUND: Dyspnea is a complex, prevalent, and distressing symptom of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) associated with decreased quality of life, significant disability, and increased mortality. It is a major reason for referral to pulmonary rehabilitation. METHODS: We reviewed 23 COPD studies to examine the evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral strategies for relieving dyspnea in COPD. RESULTS: Preliminary evidence from randomized controlled trials exists to support cognitive- behavioral strategies, used with or without exercise, for relieving sensory and affective components of dyspnea in COPD. Small to moderate treatment effects for relieving dyspnea were noted for psychotherapy (effect size [ES] = 0.08-0.25 for intensity; 0.26-0.65 for mastery) and distractive auditory stimuli (ES = 0.08-0.33 for intensity; 0.09 to -0.61 for functional burden). Small to large dyspnea improvements resulted from yoga (ES = 0.2-1.21 for intensity; 0.67 for distress; 0.07 for mastery; and -8.37 for functional burden); dyspnea self-management education with exercise (ES = -0.14 to -1.15 for intensity; -0.62 to -0.69 for distress; 1.04 for mastery; 0.14-0.35 for self-efficacy); and slow-breathing exercises (ES = -0.34 to -0.83 for intensity; -0.61 to -0.80 for distress; and 0.62 for self-efficacy). Cognitive-behavioral interventions may relieve dyspnea in COPD by (1) decreasing sympathetic nerve activity, dynamic hyperinflation, and comorbid anxiety, and (2) promoting arterial oxygen saturation, myelinated vagus nerve activity, a greater exercise training effect, and neuroplasticity. CONCLUSION: While evidence is increasing, additional randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of psychosocial and self-management interventions in relieving dyspnea, in order to make them more available to patients and to endorse them in official COPD, dyspnea, and pulmonary rehabilitation practice guidelines. By relieving dyspnea and related anxiety, such interventions may promote adherence to exercise programs and adaptive lifestyle change.	Norweg, Anna;Collins, Eileen G	2013

24088535	Mindfulness based stress reduction study design of a longitudinal randomized controlled complementary intervention in women with breast cancer.	BACKGROUND: The stress of a breast cancer diagnosis and its treatment can produce a variety of psychosocial sequelae including impaired immune responses. Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a structured complementary program that incorporates meditation, yoga and mind-body exercises. Despite promising empirical evidence for the efficacy of MBSR, there is a need for randomized controlled trials (RCT). There is also a need for RCTs investigating the efficacy of psychosocial interventions on mood disorder and immune response in women with breast cancer. Therefore, the overall aim is to determine the efficacy of a Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) intervention on well-being and immune response in women with breast cancer. METHODS AND DESIGN: In this RCT, patients diagnosed with breast cancer, will consecutively be recruited to participate. Participants will be randomized into one of three groups: MBSR Intervention I (weekly group sessions + self-instructing program), MBSR Intervention II (self-instructing program), and Controls (non-MBSR). Data will be collected before start of intervention, and 3, 6, and 12 months and thereafter yearly up to 5 years. This study may contribute to evidence-based knowledge concerning the efficacy of MBSR to support patient empowerment to regain health in breast cancer disease. DISCUSSION: The present study may contribute to evidence-based knowledge concerning the efficacy of mindfulness training to support patient empowerment to regain health in a breast cancer disease. If MBSR is effective for symptom relief and quality of life, the method will have significant clinical relevance that may generate standard of care for patients with breast cancer.

24079747	Adapting evidence-based interventions using a common theory, practices, and principles.	Hundreds of validated evidence-based intervention programs (EBIP) aim to improve families' well-being; however, most are not broadly adopted. As an alternative diffusion strategy, we created wellness centers to reach families' everyday lives with a prevention framework. At two wellness centers, one in a middle-class neighborhood and one in a low-income neighborhood, popular local activity leaders (instructors of martial arts, yoga, sports, music, dancing, Zumba), and motivated parents were trained to be Family Mentors. Trainings focused on a framework that taught synthesized, foundational prevention science theory, practice elements, and principles, applied to specific content areas (parenting, social skills, and obesity). Family Mentors were then allowed to adapt scripts and activities based on their cultural experiences but were closely monitored and supervised over time. The framework was implemented in a range of activities (summer camps, coaching) aimed at improving social, emotional, and behavioral outcomes. Successes and challenges are discussed for (a) engaging parents and communities; (b) identifying and training Family Mentors to promote children and families' well-being; and (c) gathering data for supervision, outcome evaluation, and continuous quality improvement. To broadly diffuse prevention to families, far more experimentation is needed with alternative and engaging implementation strategies that are enhanced with knowledge harvested from researchers' past 30 years of experience creating EBIP. One strategy is to train local parents and popular activity leaders in applying robust prevention science theory, common practice elements, and principles of EBIP. More systematic evaluation of such innovations is needed.	Rotheram-Borus, Mary Jane;Swendeman, Dallas;Becker, Kimberly D	2014
24067321	Yoga therapy for anxiety: a case report.	Yoga therapy is a mind-body intervention that can be an important solution in the treatment of anxiety. Yoga therapy alleviates the hyperarousal of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the hypervigilance of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis that occurs in anxiety. Yoga therapy activates the parasympathetic branch of the nervous system, replacing SNS overdrive, or the flight-or-fight response, with the relaxation response and balancing the nervous system. Yoga therapy increases positive coping skills and builds self-esteem without harmful side effects. The results of this case study have demonstrated the clinical efficacy of yoga therapy in the treatment of anxiety and panic disorder (PD) in an adolescent female. Treatment consisted of 4 wks of individual sessions (60-min session/wk) and 6 wks of group sessions (90-min session/wk) with daily home practice. The results of the case study are significant because growing numbers of youth in the United States are presenting with anxiety and seeking nonpharmacological options.

24050585	The value of complementary and alternative medicine in the treatment of climacteric symptoms: results of a survey among German gynecologists.	OBJECTIVES: The present study aims to detect the attitude and experience towards complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in the treatment of climacteric disorders among gynecologists in Germany. STUDY DESIGN: A self-administered questionnaire, containing 15 questions, was sent to all gynecologists in private practice in Germany (n=9589). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Gynecologists were asked about their experience with several forms of CAM. They were asked to rate different procedures as "effective", "sometimes effective" or "unimportant". RESULTS: The response rate was 33.7% (n=3227). We report on 2549 (26.6%) eligible questionnaires. Well-known therapies were black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa), chaste tree (Vitex agnus castus) and St. John's wort. More than 98% had had experiences with these therapies. Fewer experiences were stated with hormone-yoga (42.9%), acupuncture (29.1%) and homeopathy (21.6%). The most effective alternative therapy rated was an alteration of lifestyle with 54.4% (n=1325) stating it was effective and 35.7% (n=871) stating it was sometimes effective. Only 3.9% (n=96) prescribed no efficacy to a change of lifestyle. Other treatments rated as effective were St. John's wort (25.0%, n=606) and Black cohosh (21.1%, n=527). Agents regarded most ineffective were hormone-yoga (4.7%, n=109), acupuncture (10.3%, n=243) and homeopathy (10.6%, n=250). Female gynecologists were more likely to vote for a therapy to be effective compared to their male colleagues. CONCLUSIONS: German gynecologists seem to have made positive experiences with CAM when observing their patients, in general. An alteration of lifestyle is seen as the most effective alternative therapy in menopause. Due to their widespread use, possible side effect of natural agents should be excluded.	von Studnitz, Friederike S G;Eulenburg, Christine;Mueck, Alfred O;Buhling, Kai J	2013 Oct
24049416	Anti depressant activity of Mamsyadi Kwatha: An Ayurvedic compound formulation.	Depression is a psychiatric condition in which there is loss of interest in all pleasurable outlets, viz. food, sex, work, friends, hobbies and entertainment. The prevalence rate of the disease is 6-8% in women and 3-5% in men. Ayurveda, the science of life, provides systematic management principles for depression. Mamsyadi Kwatha is one such formulation stated by Yadavji Trikamji Acharya in Siddha Yoga Sangraha and Bheshaja Samhita, which is said to be effective in psychiatric conditions. The ingredients are Jatamansi (Nardostachys jatamansi), Ashwagandh (Withania somnifera) and Parasika Yavani (Hyocymus niger) in an 8:4:1 ratio, respectively. The test drug was subjected for antidepressant activity in experimental models. The models selected for anti depressant activity were behavioral despair test, anti-reserpine test and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) test in albino mice. The test formulation showed significant inhibition of behavioural despair (P < 0.05), weak to moderate anti-reserpine activity - ptosis (P < 0.001), catatonia (P < 0.01), sedation (P < 0.01) and moderate effect in CFS test (P < 0.050). These effects clearly show that Mamsyadi Kwatha has an anti-depressant activity.	Shreevathsa, M;Ravishankar, B;Dwivedi, Rambabu	2013 Jan
24049404	Evaluation of Stambhanakaraka Yoga and counseling in the management of Shukragata Vata (premature ejaculation).	Premature Ejaculation (PE) is a very common male sexual problem. Anxiety, stress, fear etc., are the main predisposing factors of PE. In Ayurveda, this condition can be correlated with Shukragata Vata. In the present study, fifty five patients with PE were grouped into two and were treated with Stambhanakaraka Yoga (n = 30) and Placebo (n = 20) for a duration of two months, with luke warm water as anupana. Psychological counseling was given to the patients in both the groups. After completion of treatment, Stambhanakaraka Yoga showed significant results against placebo in all parameters, namely Intravaginal Ejaculation Latency Time (IELT), voluntary control over ejaculation, patient and partner's satisfaction, performance anxiety.

24049210	Effect of yoga therapy on plasma oxytocin and facial emotion recognition deficits in patients of schizophrenia.	CONTEXT: Yoga therapy has been demonstrated to be useful in treatment of negative symptoms and improving the socio-occupational functioning and emotion recognition deficits in antipsychotic-stabilized schizophrenia patients. Oxytocin has been recently implicated in social cognition deficits in schizophrenia. The effect of yoga therapy on oxytocin levels in schizophrenia has not been studied. AIMS: This study aimed to assess the effect of yoga therapy on symptoms, socio-occupational functioning, facial emotion recognition deficits and plasma oxytocin levels in antipsychotic stabilized schizophrenia patients. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Randomized controlled study on 43 consenting, medication stabilized patients with schizophrenia in a tertiary psychiatric center using yoga intervention and waitlisted groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 43 schizophrenia patients were randomized to yoga group (n=15) or waitlist group (n=28). Patients in the yoga group received training in a specific yoga therapy module for schizophrenia. Patients in both groups were continued on stable antipsychotic medication. Assessments included scale for assessment of positive symptoms, scale for assessment of negative symptoms, socio-occupational functioning scale and tool for recognition of emotions in neuropsychiatric disorders (TRENDS) and plasma oxytocin levels; performed at baseline and at the end of 1 month. RESULTS: A total of 15 patients in the yoga group and 12 in waitlist group completed the study. The yoga therapy group showed a significant improvement in socio-occupational functioning, performance on TRENDS (P<0.001) and plasma increase in oxytocin levels (P=0.01) as compared with the waitlist group. CONCLUSION: The study supported the role of add-on yoga therapy in management of schizophrenia and demonstrated an improvement in endogenous plasma oxytocin levels in schizophrenia patients receiving yoga therapy.

24049209	Cortisol and antidepressant effects of yoga.	CONTEXT: Hypercortisolemia is well-known in depression and yoga has been demonstrated earlier to reduce the parameters of stress, including cortisol levels. AIM: We aimed to find the role of yoga as an antidepressant as well as its action on lowering the serum cortisol levels. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: An open-labeled study consisting of three groups (yoga alone, yoga along with antidepressant medication and antidepressant medication alone) was conducted at a tertiary care psychiatry hospital. METHODOLOGY: Out-patient depressives who were not suicidal were offered yoga as a possible antidepressant therapy. A validated yoga module was used as therapy taught over a month and to be practiced at home daily. Patients were free to choose the drugs if their psychiatrist advised. Patients (n=54) were rated on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) with serum cortisol measurements at baseline and after 3 months. In 54 patients, assessments and blood test results were both available. 19 each received yoga alone or with drugs and 16 received drugs only. Healthy comparison subjects (n=18) too underwent morning cortisol measurements once. RESULTS: Serum cortisol was higher in depressives compared with controls. In the total sample, the cortisol level dropped significantly at the end of treatment. More patients in the yoga groups had a drop in cortisol levels as compared to drug-only group. In the yoga-only group, the cortisol drop correlated with the drop in HDRS score (antidepressant effect). CONCLUSION: The findings support that yoga may act at the level of the hypothalamus by its 'anti-stress' effects (reducing the cortisol), to bring about relief in depression.

24049208	Positive therapeutic and neurotropic effects of yoga in depression: A comparative study.	CONTEXT: Therapeutic effect of yoga in depression is recognized. Neuroplastic effects of antidepressant therapies are inferred by elevations in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Role of yoga in both these effects has not been studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Non-suicidal, consecutive out-patients of depression were offered yoga either alone or with antidepressants. The depression severity was rated on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) before and at 3 months. Serum BDNF levels were measured at the same time points. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was performed to look at change across groups with respect to HDRS scores and BDNF levels over 3 months of follow-up. Relationship between change in serum BDNF levels and change in HDRS scores was assessed using the Pearson's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Both yoga groups were better than drugs-only group with respect to reduction in HDRS scores. Serum BDNF rose in the total sample in the 3-month period. This was not, however, different across treatment groups. There was a significant positive correlation between fall in HDRS and rise in serum BDNF levels in yoga-only group (r=0.702; P=0.001), but not in those receiving yoga and antidepressants or antidepressants-alone. CONCLUSIONS: Neuroplastic mechanisms may be related to the therapeutic mechanisms of yoga in depression.	Naveen, G H;Thirthalli, J;Rao, M G;Varambally, S;Christopher, R;Gangadhar, B N	2013 Jul
24049206	Yoga increases the volume of the hippocampus in elderly subjects.	CONTEXT: The neurobiological effect of yoga on the cortical structures in the elderly is as yet unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven healthy elderly subjects received yoga intervention as an add-on life-style practice. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained before and 6 months later. Voxel-based-morphometric analyses compared the brains before and after the yoga. RESULTS: Yoga group was found to have increases in hippocampal, but not in occipital gray matter. CONCLUSION: Yoga has potential to reduce neuro-senescence. Small sample size and absence of the control group prevent generalization of the findings limiting its translational value.

24049205	Yoga and epilepsy: What do patients perceive?	CONTEXT: Benefit of yoga therapy in the management of epilepsy is emerging. However, there is no data available about the knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of yoga amongst people living with epilepsy (PLWE). AIMS: This study was designed to explore the KAP about yoga among PLWE. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The study was conducted on 300 PLWE attending the neurology out-patient services of a tertiary care hospital. METHODOLOGY: Three hundred PLWE (male:female=173:127; age: 31.6+/-12.4 years) attending the neurology out-patient services of a neuropsychiatry hospital were administered a pre-tested KAP questionnaire. RESULTS: About 87.4% were on regular anti-epileptic drugs and half (50.3%) on monotherapy. Use of complementary and alternative medicine by the respondents included: Ayurveda (26.7%), yoga (25.6%) and homeopathy (16.3%) or folk medicine (29.1%). Nearly 33.7% of the respondents reported that yoga is beneficial in managing epilepsy. More than half the respondents (54.8%) were willing to practice yoga. Those who practiced yoga opined that regular practice of yoga might reduce dosage of medication (62.8%), their side effects (51.3%) and frequency of seizures (54.5%). Majority of the patients were willing to practice yoga, if yoga services were offered. CONCLUSION: The gaps in KAP identified in this study point to the need for more systematic effort to bring about awareness of yoga in patients with epilepsy.

24049204	Effect of yoga therapy on anxiety and depressive symptoms and quality-of-life among caregivers of in-patients with neurological disorders at a tertiary care center in India: A randomized controlled trial.	CONTEXT: The concerns of caregivers of patients with neurological disorders have been a felt need for a long time, with many of them experiencing significant psychiatric morbidity. AIMS: This study aimed to find the effect of yoga in reducing anxiety and depression, as well as improving quality-of-life in caregivers of patients with neurological disorders. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The study was conducted using a randomized controlled design, with yoga intervention and waitlisted controls. METHODOLOGY: SIXTY CONSENTING CAREGIVERS OF INPATIENTS IN NEUROLOGY WARDS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS: Yoga and control. Demographic variables except years of education and length of caretaking were comparable in the two groups, as also baseline scores of anxiety, depression and quality-of-life. A specific yoga module comprising yogasanas, pranayama, and chanting was taught to the participants in the yoga group by the researcher. At follow-up 43 patients (yoga n=20 and control group n=23) were available. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance was used to test the change from pre-test to post-test scores within and between groups. Analysis of covariance was performed to compare the post-test scores between the groups adjusting for education and length of caretaking. RESULTS: Following one month intervention of yoga therapy, there was a significant (P<0.001) decrease in anxiety and depression scores, as well as improved quality-of-life among the participants in the yoga group as compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the usefulness of a yoga intervention for caregivers of inpatients with neurological problems. The small sample size and lack of blinding were some of the limitations of this study.	Umadevi, P;Ramachandra;Varambally, S;Philip, M;Gangadhar, B N	2013 Jul
24049203	Feasibility and efficacy of yoga as an add-on intervention in attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder: An exploratory study.	CONTEXT: Attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders. Stimulant medication is frequently used in management, with significant adverse effects. There is a growing interest in complementary treatments like yoga. AIMS: To study the effects of yoga as a complementary therapy in children with moderate to severe ADHD. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The study was performed on children (consent was taken from parents) admitted in a child psychiatry unit using an open-label exploratory study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children between 5 and 16 years of age diagnosed with ADHD and co-operative for yoga were included. Subjects with other serious psychiatric and medical illnesses were excluded. The participants were given yoga training daily during their in-patient stay. They were rated on Conners' abbreviated rating scale - (CARS), ADHD-rating scale-IV (ADHD - RS IV) and clinical global impression (CGI)-Severity, at the beginning of study, at discharge and subsequently at the end of 1(st), 2(nd) and 3(rd) month by a research associate not involved in yoga instruction. Paired t-test was employed to compare the means of scores between baseline and follow-ups. RESULTS: A total of 9 children (8 males, 1 female) were recruited into the study. All, but one were on medications. An average of 8 yoga training sessions was given to subjects. They were able to learn yoga reasonably well. There was a significant improvement in the ADHD symptoms as assessed on CARS (P-0.014), ADHD-RS IV (P=0.021) and CGI- S scales (P=0.004) at the time of discharge.

24049202	Efficacy of yoga as an add-on treatment for in-patients with functional psychotic disorder.	CONTEXT: The efficacy of yoga as an intervention for in-patients with psychosis is as yet unknown; although, previous studies have shown efficacy in stabilized out-patients with schizophrenia. AIM: This study aimed to compare the effect of add-on yoga therapy or physical exercise along with standard pharmacotherapy in the treatment of in-patients with psychosis. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This study was performed in an in-patient setting using a randomized controlled single blind design. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 88 consenting in-patients with psychosis were randomized into yoga therapy group (n=44) and physical exercise group (n=44). Sixty patients completed the study period of 1(1/2) months. Patients who completed in the yoga group (n=35) and in the exercise group (n=25) were similar on the demographic profile, illness parameters and psychopathology scores at baseline. RESULTS: The two treatment groups were not different on the clinical syndrome scores at the end of 2 weeks. At the end of 6 weeks, patients in the yoga group however had lower mean scores on Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGIS), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (total and general psychopathology subscale) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) (P<0.05). Repeated measure analysis of variance detected an advantage for yoga over exercise in reducing the clinical CGIS and HDRS scores. CONCLUSION: Adding yoga intervention to standard pharmacological treatment is feasible and may be beneficial even in the early and acute stage of psychosis.

24049201	Positive antidepressant effects of generic yoga in depressive out-patients: A comparative study.	CONTEXT: Therapeutic effects in depression of yoga adopted from different schools have been demonstrated. The efficacy of a generic module of yoga on depressed patients has not yet been tested in the literature. AIMS: The study was aimed to compare the therapeutic effect of a generic yoga module with antidepressant drugs in non-suicidal out-patients of major depression attending a psychiatric hospital. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The study was outpatient-based using an open-labeled design. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 137 out-patients of depressive disorders received one of the three treatments as they chose - yoga-only, drugs-only or both. The yoga was taught by a trained yoga physician for over a month in spaced sessions totaling at least 12. Patients were assessed before treatment, after 1 and 3 months on depression and Clinical Global Impression Scales. Out of 137, 58 patients completed the study period with all assessments. RESULTS: Patients in the three arms of treatment were comparable on demographic and clinical variables. Patients in all three arms of treatment obtained a reduction in depression scores as well as clinical severity. However, both yoga groups (with or without drugs) were significantly better than the drugs-only group. Higher proportion of patients remitted in the yoga groups compared with the drugs-only group. No untoward events were spontaneously reported in the yoga-treated patients. CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of this study, it can be concluded that the findings support a case for prescribing yoga as taught in the study in depressive non-suicidal out-patients.

24049200	Effects of yoga intervention on sleep and quality-of-life in elderly: A randomized controlled trial.	CONTEXT: Yoga as a life-style practice has demonstrated beneficial effects. The role of yoga in the elderly for such benefits merits investigation. AIMS: The aim of this study is to examine the effects of yoga intervention on quality-of-life (QOL) and sleep quality in the elderly living in old age homes. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Single blind controlled study with block randomization of elderly homes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 120 subjects from nine elderly homes were randomized in to yoga group (n=62) and waitlist group (n=58). Subjects in the yoga group were given yoga intervention daily for 1 month and weekly until 3 months and were encouraged to practice yoga without supervision until for 6 months. Subjects in waitlist group received no intervention during this period. Subjects were evaluated with World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL)-BREF for measuring QOL and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index for sleep quality in the baseline and after 6 months. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Independent t-test and repeated measures analysis of covariance respectively was used to measure the difference in outcome measures between the two groups at baseline and after the study period. RESULTS: Subjects in the yoga group had significantly higher number of years of formal education. Subjects in the yoga group had significant improvement in all the domains of QOL and total sleep quality after controlling for the effect of baseline difference in education between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Yoga intervention appears to improve the QOL and sleep quality of elderly living in old age homes. There is a need for further studies overcoming the limitations in this study to confirm the benefits of yoga for elderly in QOL and sleep quality.

24049199	Randomized clinical trial of yoga-based intervention in residents from elderly homes: Effects on cognitive function.	CONTEXT: Elderly have increased risk for cognitive impairment and dementia. Yoga therapy may be helpful in elderly to improve cognitive function. AIMS: We examined the benefits of yoga-based intervention compared with waitlist control group on cognitive function in the residents of elderly homes. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Single blind controlled study with block randomization of elderly homes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study sample included yoga group (n=62) and waitlist group (n=58). A total of 87 subjects (yoga=44, waitlist=43) completed the study period of 6 months. Yoga group received daily yoga sessions for 1 month, weekly until 3(rd) month and encouraged to continue unsupervised until 6 months. They were assessed on Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Rey's complex figure test (CFT), Wechsler's Memory Scale (WMS)-digit and spatial span, Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA) test, Stroop Color Word Interference Test and Trail Making Test A and B at baseline and at the end of 6(th) month. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Paired t-test and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to compare the difference in neuropsychological test scores. RESULTS: Yoga group showed significant improvement in immediate and delayed recall of verbal (RAVLT) and visual memory (CFT), attention and working memory (WMS-spatial span), verbal fluency (COWA), executive function (Stroop interference) and processing speed (Trail Making Test-A) than waitlist group at the end of 6 months after correcting for corresponding baseline score and education. CONCLUSION: Yoga based-intervention appears beneficial to improve several domains of cognitive function in elderly living in residential care homes. Study findings need to be interpreted after considering methodological limitations like lack of active comparison group.

24049198	Development and feasibility of yoga therapy module for out-patients with depression in India.	CONTEXT: Evidence suggests that certain yoga practices are useful in the management of depression. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no study that deals with the formulation of a yoga module for the particular clinical features of depression. AIM: The main aim of our study was to develop a comprehensive yoga therapy module targeting specific clinical features of depression. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Specific yoga practices were matched for clinical features of depression based on a thorough literature review. A yoga program was developed, which consisted of Suksmavyayama, (loosening exercises), asanas (postures), relaxation techniques, Pranayama (breathing exercises) and chanting meditation to be taught in a 2 week period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A structured questionnaire was developed for validation from nine experienced yoga professionals. The final version of yoga therapy module was pilot-tested on seven patients (five females) with depression recruited from outpatient service of National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Bangalore. RESULTS: The final yoga therapy module had those practices that received a score of three or more (moderately/very much/extremely useful) from all responders. Six out of nine (>65%) experts suggested Suksmavyayama should be included. Five out of nine experts opined that training with 10 sessions (over 2 weeks) is rather short. All experts opined that the module is easy to teach, learn and practice. At the pilot stage, the five patients who completed the module reported more than 80% satisfaction about the yoga practices and how the yoga was taught. Severity of depression substantially reduced at both 1 and 3 months follow-up. CONCLUSION: The developed comprehensive yoga therapy module was validated by experts in the field and was found to be feasible and useful in patients with depression.

24049197	Designing, validation and feasibility of a yoga-based intervention for elderly.	CONTEXT: Ageing is an unavoidable facet of life. Yogic practices have been reported to promote healthy aging. Previous studies have used either yoga therapy interventions derived from a particular school of yoga or have tested specific yogic practices like meditation. AIMS: This study reports the development, validation and feasibility of a yoga-based intervention for elderly with or without mild cognitive impairment. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The study was conducted at the Advanced Centre for Yoga, National Institute for Mental Health and Neurosciences, Bangalore. The module was developed, validated, and then pilot-tested on volunteers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The first part of the study consisted of designing of a yoga module based on traditional and contemporary yogic literature. This yoga module along with the three case vignettes of elderly with cognitive impairment were sent to 10 yoga experts to help develop the intended yoga-based intervention. In the second part, the feasibility of the developed yoga-based intervention was tested. RESULTS: Experts (n=10) opined the yoga-based intervention will be useful in improving cognition in elderly, but with some modifications. Frequent supervised yoga sessions, regular follow-ups, addition/deletion/modifications of yoga postures were some of the suggestions. Ten elderly consented and eight completed the pilot testing of the intervention. All of them were able to perform most of the Suksmavyayama, Pranayama and Nadanusandhana (meditation) technique without difficulty. Some of the participants (n=3) experienced difficulty in performing postures seated on the ground. Most of the older adults experienced difficulty in remembering and completing entire sequence of yoga-based intervention independently. CONCLUSIONS: The yoga based intervention is feasible in the elderly with cognitive impairment. Testing with a larger sample of older adults is warranted.

24045673	Efficacy of yoga for vasomotor symptoms: a randomized controlled trial.	OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the efficacy of yoga in alleviating vasomotor symptoms (VMS) frequency and bother. METHODS: This study was a three-by-two factorial, randomized controlled trial. Eligible women were randomized to yoga (n = 107), exercise (n = 106), or usual activity (n = 142), and were simultaneously randomized to a double-blind comparison of omega-3 fatty acid (n = 177) or placebo (n = 178) capsules. Yoga intervention consisted of 12 weekly 90-minute yoga classes with daily home practice. Primary outcomes were VMS frequency and bother assessed by daily diaries at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included insomnia symptoms (Insomnia Severity Index) at baseline and 12 weeks. RESULTS: Among 249 randomized women, 237 (95%) completed 12-week assessments. The mean baseline VMS frequency was 7.4 per day (95% CI, 6.6 to 8.1) in the yoga group and 8.0 per day (95% CI, 7.3 to 8.7) in the usual activity group. Intent-to-treat analyses included all participants with response data (n = 237). There was no difference between intervention groups in the change in VMS frequency from baseline to 6 and 12 weeks (mean difference [yoga--usual activity] from baseline at 6 wk, -0.3 [95% CI, -1.1 to 0.5]; mean difference [yoga--usual activity] from baseline at 12 wk, -0.3 [95% CI, -1.2 to 0.6]; P = 0.119 across both time points). Results were similar for VMS bother. At week 12, yoga was associated with an improvement in insomnia symptoms (mean difference [yoga - usual activity] in the change in Insomnia Severity Index, 1.3 [95% CI, -2.5 to -0.1]; P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: Among healthy women, 12 weeks of yoga class plus home practice, compared with usual activity, do not improve VMS frequency or bother but reduce insomnia symptoms.

24044586	Analysis of heart rate variability signal during meditation using deterministic-chaotic quantifiers.	This study investigated the level of chaos and the existence of fractal patterns in the heart rate variability (HRV) signal prior to meditation and during meditation using two quantifiers adapted from non-linear dynamics and deterministic chaos theory: (1) component central tendency measures (CCTMs) and (2) Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD). CCTM quantifies degree of variability/chaos in the specified quadrant of the second-order difference plot for HRV time series, while HFD quantifies dimensional complexity of the HRV series. Both the quantifiers yielded excellent results in discriminating the different psychophysiological states. The study found (1) significantly higher first quadrant CCTM values and (2) significantly lower HFD values during meditation state compared to pre-meditation state. Both of these can be attributed to the respiratory-modulated oscillations shifting to the lower frequency region by parasympathetic tone during meditation. It is thought that these quantifiers are most promising in providing new insight into the evolution of complexity of underlying dynamics in different physiological states.	Kamath, Chandrakar	2013 Oct
24043953	Evaluation of the Bonapace Method: a specific educational intervention to reduce pain during childbirth.	OBJECTIVE: As pain during childbirth is very intense, several educational programs exist to help women prepare for the event. This study evaluates the efficacy of a specific pain management program, the Bonapace Method (BM), to reduce the perception of pain during childbirth. The BM involves the father, or a significant partner, in the use of several pain control techniques based on three neurophysiological pain modulation models: (1) controlling the central nervous system through breathing, relaxation, and cognitive structuring; (2) using non-painful stimuli as described in the Gate Control Theory; and (3) recruiting descending inhibition by hyperstimulation of acupressure trigger points. METHODS: A multicenter case control study in Quebec on pain perception during labor and delivery compared traditional childbirth training programs (TCTPs) and the BM. Visual analog scales were used to measure pain perception during labor. In all, 25 women (TCTP: n = 12; BM: n = 13) successfully reported their perceptions of pain intensity and unpleasantness every 15 minutes. RESULTS: A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE PROGRESSION OF LABOR AND PAIN WAS FOUND (PAIN INTENSITY: P < 0.01; pain unpleasantness: P < 0.01). When compared to TCTP, the BM showed an overall significant lower pain perception for both intensity (45%; P < 0.01) and unpleasantness (46%; P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: These significant differences in pain perception between TCTP and the BM suggest that the emphasis on pain modulation models and techniques during labor combined with the active participation of a partner in BM are important variables to be added to the traditional childbirth training programs for childbirth pain management.

24041180	Dharma, yoga, tantra.	In the mid-20th century, Selvararajan Yesudian (1916-1998), who was born in India to a Christian father, a physician, and spent most of his life in Switzerland, coauthored (with Elisabeth Haich) a book entitled Yoga and Health; since then, the coupling of these two words has largely defined the meaning of yoga in the West, especially in promotional literature for urban yoga schools and health-club programs. Authentic Indian traditions have indeed affirmed the therapeutic benefit of yoga, but they have consistently seen yoga as a "therapy of the soul," a way of "quieting the agitations of the heart," to the end of perceiving the Ultimate within the soul and, in religious terms, of realizing union with God. This paper will examine some classical yoga texts in relation to spiritual remedies for substance misuse and other forms of addiction and chemical dependency.	Matus, Thomas	2013 Sep
24038798	A pilot evaluation on a stress management programme using a combined approach of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for elementary school teachers.	The aim of this study is to explore the efficacy of implementing a stress management programme based on a combined approach using cognitive behavioural therapy and complementary and alternative medicine for elementary school teachers who experienced mild level of stress, anxiety and/or depressive symptoms in Hong Kong. A 12-h programme involving cognitive behavioural therapy, self-management, relaxation techniques (diaphragmatic breathing and progressive muscle relaxation), mindful exercises (qigong and yoga), aromatherapy and acupressure was conducted. A quasi-experimental design was used to compare the intervention groups (n = 47) with the wait-list control groups (n = 46). The primary outcome measures were depression, anxiety and stress. Results indicated that the intervention group had significant reduction in depression [(F = 3.93; degrees of freedom (df) = 2.90; p = 0.023)], anxiety (F = 3.37; df = 2.90; p = 0.039) and stress (F = 3.63; df = 2.89; p = 0.031) when compared with the control group. Participants in both groups demonstrated lowered level of salivary cortisol at the post-assessment. The pilot results provided preliminary support to the multi-component stress management programme in relieving affective symptoms of teachers. The programme may be considered as an initial strategy to empower teachers with the abilities to cope with their affective symptoms. Further evaluation using a better designed randomized study with a larger sample size is warranted. (word: 198; max.: 200).

24038797	Hypertension analysis of stress reduction using mindfulness meditation and yoga: results from the HARMONY randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: The HARMONY study was a randomized, controlled trial examining the efficacy of an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program for blood pressure (BP) lowering among unmedicated stage 1 hypertensive participants. METHODS: Participants diagnosed with stage 1 hypertension based on ambulatory BP were randomized to either immediate treatment of MBSR for 8 weeks or wait-list control. Primary outcome analysis evaluated whether change in awake and 24-hour ambulatory BP from baseline to week 12 was significantly different between the 2 groups. A within-group before and after MBSR analysis was also performed. RESULTS: The study enrolled 101 adults (38% male) with baseline average 24-hour ambulatory BP of 135+/-7.9/82+/-5.8mm Hg and daytime ambulatory BP of 140+/-7.7/87+/-6.3 mmHg. At week 12, the change from baseline in 24-hour ambulatory BP was 0.4+/-6.7/0.0+/-4.9mm Hg for the immediate intervention and 0.4+/-7.8/-0.4+/-4.6mm Hg for the wait-list control. There were no significant differences between intervention and wait-list control for all ambulatory BP parameters. The secondary within-group analysis found a small reduction in BP after MBSR compared with baseline, a finding limited to female subjects in a sex analysis. CONCLUSIONS: MBSR did not lower ambulatory BP by a statistically or clinically significant amount in untreated, stage 1 hypertensive patients when compared with a wait-list control group. It leaves untested whether MBSR might be useful for lowering BP by improving adherence in treated hypertensive participants. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT00825526.

24022282	Helping nurses care for self, family, and patients through the nurses living fit intervention.	BACKGROUND: More than half of United States nurses are estimated to be overweight or obese. Interventions are needed that help nurses live healthier lifestyles. With most registered nurses being female and with an average age of 45.5 years in the category most likely to be obese, it is not promising that US nurses will become healthier over time without intervention. The Nurses Living Fit (NLF) program, an exercise- and nutrition-based intervention innovated by nurses, was developed to decrease body mass index in nurse participants and to help nurse's care for themselves and their families and patients. SUBJECTS: A total of 217 nurses self-selected to the NLF intervention (n = 108) or contrast (no intervention; n = 109) groups. METHODS: The NLF program included exercise (12 once-weekly sessions, 1 hour each), yoga (4 once-monthly sessions, 1 hour each), nutrition education (4 once-monthly sessions, 1 hour each taught by registered dietitians), diary completion (completed daily for 4 weeks specifying time spent on exercise/yoga, types and amount of food consumed, amount of water consumed, and hours slept), and healthy lifestyle principles education. Evaluation of the NLF program components was also completed. RESULTS: The NLF participants had significant decreases in body mass index (NLF = -0.5 kg/m; contrast = -0.2 kg/m) and waist circumference (NLF = -0.9 in; contrast = -0.2 in). Overall, program component evaluation demonstrated that participants wanted more personalized exercise, more nutrition education, and year-round program provision. As a result of the NLF program, nurses specified they exercised more and improved nutrition. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based intervention or programs are needed to educate nurses on healthy lifestyles. Nurse leaders need to promote healthy workplace environments, which can be done in part through the facilitation of exercise- and nutrition-based programs, such as NLF, to help nurses better care for themselves and their families and patients.

24020097	The influence of the 2:1 yogic breathing technique on essential hypertension.	In 2:1 breathing exhalation is twice of inhalation. The study was performed to study the influence of 2:1 yogic breathing technique on patients of essential hypertension. 30 patients of essential hypertension between ages of 20-50 years were selected. After a rest of 15-20 minutes in a comfortable sitting posture their baseline physiological parameters recorded on a digital polygraph were, Electromyogram (EMG), Galvanic skin response (GSR), Finger tip temperature (FTT), Heart rate(HR) and Respiratory rate(RR). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were recorded by automated digital Sphygmomanometer. Then they were guided to do 2:1 breathing maintaining respiratory rate of around 6/min. Subjects were then instructed to do 2:1 breathing twice a day for 5-7 minutes for next 3 months. Subjects reported back weekly for recording of BP. The physiological parameters of the subjects were assessed again by polygraph at the end of three months of practicing 2:1 yogic breathing. The mean fall of SBP over 12 weeks was 12 mm Hg (8%) and DBP was 7 mm Hg (7%). P value < 0.001 in both. After practicing 2:1 breathing for 3 months there was statistically significant reduction of SBP, DBP, HR RR, EMG, GSR and rise in FTT. The study showed that 2:1 breathing technique caused a comprehensive change in body physiology by altering various parameters that are governed by the autonomic nervous system. It is an effective modality for management of essential hypertension.	Adhana, Ritu;Gupta, Rani;Dvivedii, Jyoti;Ahmad, Sohaib	2013 Jan-Mar

24016821	Evaluation of the benefits of a kripalu yoga program for police academy trainees: a pilot study.	BACKGROUND: Law enforcement ranks as one of the most stressful occupations in the world. Yoga is a mind-body practice composed of postures, breathing, and meditation techniques, and is known for its beneficial effects on stress and mood disturbance. OBJECTIVES: This pilot study evaluated the effects of Kripalu yoga on perceived stress, mood, and mindfulness during police academy training. METHOD: Forty-two recruits participated in a 6-class yoga intervention. Participants completed the Profile of Mood States-Short Form, Perceived Stress Scale, and the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire prior to and immediately following completion of the yoga program, as well as an exit survey. RESULTS: Paired samples t-tests revealed significant postintervention changes in perceived stress and mood, reductions in tension and fatigue, and a trend toward reduced anger. Changes in mindfulness were not detected. The exit survey indicated perceived benefits of yoga for some participants. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study suggests that yoga may be beneficial for reducing stress, tension, and fatigue among police academy trainees. Future longitudinal randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate its full potential as a permanent component of police academy training.	Jeter, Pamela E;Cronin, Susan;Khalsa, Sat Bir S	2013
24016820	Yoga, vertebral fractures, and osteoporosis: research and recommendations.	BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is characterized by decreased bone density that leaves bones fragile and highly susceptible to fracture. Globally, 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men older than 50 will suffer from an osteoporotic fracture, and those individuals will experience a considerably higher risk of postfracture mortality than will the general population. Gentle, weight-bearing exercises such as yoga can help prevent or cease the progression of osteoporosis; however, there is insufficient data regarding which yoga poses present the least risk and are most beneficial to individuals with reduced bone density. OBJECTIVES: Review the extant literature about the risks and benefits to the spine of particular forms of movement and consider recommendations relative to the practice of yoga. METHODS: A review of the PubMed, Medline, and Cochrane databases was conducted that identified manuscripts published between 1966 and 2011 about topics related to osteoporosis and spinal movement. CONCLUSIONS: Movements involving spinal flexion can increase risk for vertebral compression fractures; however, a combination of mild spinal flexion and extension may prove beneficial. Moderate, weight-bearing activities that strengthen the muscles supporting the spinal column, promote balance, improve posture, and enhance quality of life appear to be of greatest benefit. Ample evidence supports the importance of varied spinal movement for preserving the health and strength of the vertebral bodies. Exercise modifications suitable for high-risk individuals may be counterproductive for those at low risk for vertebral fractures. Yoga therapists are cautioned to not apply a one-size-fits-all approach when working with this population. Well-designed empirical studies are needed to further our understanding of which yoga poses present the least risk and are of greatest benefit to individuals with osteoporosis.

24016819	Defining yoga-nidra: traditional accounts, physiological research, and future directions.	The term yoga-nidra has been used in many empirical studies to refer to relaxation and guided imagery. These techniques do not represent the intention or physiological correlates of yoganidra discussed in the traditional yoga literature. We propose an operational definition of yoga-nidra that is supported by several physiologically testable hypotheses regarding its outcomes and effects. Traditional descriptions of yoga-nidra and contemporary accounts of its practice are reviewed, and studies examining the physiological correlates of yoga-nidra are examined. Proposed hypotheses for future research using this operational definition are provided.	Parker, Stephen;Bharati, Swami Veda;Fernandez, Manuel	2013

24000842	Mindfulness as a transtheoretical clinical process.	The use of mindfulness in psychotherapy has garnered the attention of both researchers and therapists over recent years. Based on established research, use of mindfulness with clients is recommended to improve awareness during sessions, reduce ruminative thinking patterns, and increase self-compassion regardless of theoretical orientation. In this article, de-identified clinical material is used to illustrate both informal and formal mindfulness training in session. Further, we provide illustrations of presession and within-session therapist mindfulness, recommending that therapists develop their own mindfulness practice, as research has demonstrated that it is related to important clinical skills including attentiveness, nonjudgment, and improved client perceptions.

23990027	Rheumatologists' opinions towards complementary and alternative medicine: a systematic review.	People with chronic musculoskeletal conditions are high users of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM). This systematic review was conducted to evaluate the attitudes of rheumatologists towards CAM and to identify whether these attitudes are affected by the personal or practice characteristics of the rheumatologists. A systematic search of electronic databases identified five eligible studies and one supplementary abstract, published before 1 December 2012. Outcomes measuring rheumatologists' attitudes towards CAM were extracted, as were any analysis of correlations with characteristics of the rheumatologist. Study quality was assessed using the STROBE checklist. Six studies from the USA, Canada and the Netherlands met inclusion criteria, with sample sizes ranging from 101 to 2,000. The studies were of variable methodological quality. Rheumatologists' opinions towards CAM varied according to therapy type. Many held favourable opinions towards bodywork and meditation, believed in their benefits and provided referrals for use. Other therapies, such as energy-based medicine, were regarded with scepticism. There were no demographic characteristics that consistently correlated with CAM attitudes or use. The limited data describing rheumatologist's attitudes to CAM is of varying quality but suggests that attitudes are influenced by the rheumatologist's familiarity with the CAM therapy and the degree to which a therapy has been assessed in a scientific manner. Given the high use of CAM amongst individuals seen in rheumatology clinics, physicians should undertake high-quality research to assess effectiveness of CAM therapy.

23982113	Efficacy of omega-3 for vasomotor symptoms treatment: a randomized controlled trial.	OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the efficacy and tolerability of omega-3 fatty acids in reducing vasomotor symptoms (VMS) frequency and bother in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. METHODS: This study was a 12-week, three-by-two factorial, randomized controlled trial. Eligible women were randomized to a double-blind comparison of omega-3 (n = 177) or placebo (n = 178) capsules, and simultaneously to yoga (n = 107), aerobic exercise (n = 106), or their usual physical activity (n = 142). Participants received 1.8 g of omega-3 daily for 12 weeks. Each capsule contained ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid (425 mg), docosahexaenoic acid (100 mg), and other omega-3s (90 mg). Primary outcomes were VMS frequency and bother. Secondary outcomes included sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), insomnia symptoms (Insomnia Severity Index), depressive symptoms (Physician's Health Questionnaire-8), and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7). RESULTS: The mean baseline frequency of VMS per day was 7.6 (95% CI, 7.0 to 8.2). After 12 weeks, the reduction in VMS frequency with omega-3 (-2.5; 95% CI, -3.0 to -1.9) did not differ significantly from that with placebo (-2.7; 95% CI, -3.3 to -2.2), with a relative difference of 0.3 fewer hot flashes per day (95% CI, -0.5 to 1.0; P = 0.28). Changes in VMS bother at 12 weeks were also similar between groups, with no relative difference on a four-point scale (95% CI, -0.1 to 0.2; P = 0.36). Omega-3s compared with placebo showed no improvement in self-reported sleep or mood (P > 0.09 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: Among healthy, sedentary perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, a 12-week treatment with omega-3 does not improve VMS frequency, VMS bother, sleep, or mood compared with placebo.

23981408	Iyengar yoga and the use of props for pediatric chronic pain: a case study.	Iyengar yoga uses postures and props to support the body so that practitioners can engage in poses that would otherwise be more difficult. This type of yoga may be useful in treating children and adolescents who have chronic pain and disability. In this case study, the authors discuss a 14-y-old girl who had two surgeries for gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) and who had continued chest and abdominal pain, as well as vomiting, difficulty eating, weight loss, and anxiety. Having significantly impaired functioning, she was unable to attend school, sleep, socialize, or eat, and she had become wheelchair-bound. Despite evaluations and treatments by specialists over an extended period of time, her symptoms had not improved. This case history describes how the authors used a 4-mo treatment of Iyengar yoga to help the adolescent resume activities and re-engage with her environment. The authors intend this report to stimulate scientific study of this form of treatment for children and adolescents with chronic pain.

23981048	Psychosocial and cardiac outcomes of yoga for ICD patients: a randomized clinical control trial.	BACKGROUND: Because as many as 46% of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) patients experience clinical symptoms of shock anxiety, this randomized controlled study evaluated the efficacy of adapted yoga (vs usual care) in reducing clinical psychosocial risks shown to impact morbidity and mortality in ICD recipients. METHODS: Forty-six participants were randomized to a control group or an 8-week adapted yoga group that followed a standardized protocol with weekly classes and home practice. Medical and psychosocial data were collected at baseline and follow-up, then compared and analyzed. RESULTS: Total shock anxiety decreased for the yoga group and increased for the control group, t(4.43, 36), P < 0.0001, with significant differences between these changes. Similarly, consequential anxiety decreased for the yoga group but increased for the control group t(2.86,36) P = 0.007. Compared to the control, the yoga group had greater overall self-compassion, t(-2.84,37), P = 0.007, and greater mindfulness, t(-2.10,37) P = 0.04, at the end of the study. Exploratory analyses utilizing a linear model (R(2) = 0.98) of observed device-treated ventricular (DTV) events revealed that the expected number of DTV events in the yoga group was significantly lower than in the control group (P < 0.0001). Compared to the control, the yoga group had a 32% lower risk of experiencing device-related firings at end of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated psychosocial benefits from a program of adapted yoga (vs usual care) for ICD recipients. These data support continued research to better understand the role of complementary medicine to address ICD-specific stress in cardiac outcomes.

23974565	Social Media for the Promotion of Holistic Self-Participatory Care: An Evidence Based Approach. Contribution of the IMIA Social Media Working Group.	OBJECTIVES: As health information is becoming increasingly accessible, social media offers ample opportunities to track, be informed, share and promote health. These authors explore how social media and holistic care may work together; more specifically however, our objective is to document, from different perspectives, how social networks have impacted, supported and helped sustain holistic self-participatory care. METHODS: A literature review was performed to investigate the use of social media for promoting health in general and complementary alternative care. We also explore a case study of an intervention for improving the health of Greek senior citizens through digital and other means. RESULTS: The Health Belief Model provides a framework for assessing the benefits of social media interventions in promoting comprehensive participatory self-care. Some interventions are particularly effective when integrating social media with real-world encounters. Yet not all social media tools are evidence-based and efficacious. Interestingly, social media is also used to elicit patient ratings of treatments (e.g., for depression), often demonstrating the effectiveness of complementary treatments, such as yoga and mindfulness meditation. CONCLUSIONS: To facilitate the use of social media for the promotion of complementary alternative medicine through self-quantification, social connectedness and sharing of experiences, exploration of concrete and abstract ideas are presented here within. The main mechanisms by which social support may help improve health - emotional support, an ability to share experiences, and non-hierarchal roles, emphasizing reciprocity in giving and receiving support - are integral to social media and provide great hope for its effective use.

23940231	Multicenter, randomized controlled trial of yoga for sleep quality among cancer survivors.	PURPOSE: Thirty percent to 90% of cancer survivors report impaired sleep quality post-treatment, which can be severe enough to increase morbidity and mortality. Lifestyle interventions, such as exercise, are recommended in conjunction with drugs and cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of impaired sleep. Preliminary evidence indicates that yoga-a mind-body practice and form of exercise-may improve sleep among cancer survivors. The primary aim of this randomized, controlled clinical trial was to determine the efficacy of a standardized yoga intervention compared with standard care for improving global sleep quality (primary outcome) among post-treatment cancer survivors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 410 survivors suffering from moderate or greater sleep disruption between 2 and 24 months after surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy were randomly assigned to standard care or standard care plus the 4-week yoga intervention. The yoga intervention used the Yoga for Cancer Survivors (YOCAS) program consisting of pranayama (breathing exercises), 16 Gentle Hatha and Restorative yoga asanas (postures), and meditation. Participants attended two 75-minute sessions per week. Sleep quality was assessed by using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and actigraphy pre- and postintervention. RESULTS: In all, 410 survivors were accrued (96% female; mean age, 54 years; 75% had breast cancer). Yoga participants demonstrated greater improvements in global sleep quality and, secondarily, subjective sleep quality, daytime dysfunction, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, and medication use at postintervention (all P </= .05) compared with standard care participants. CONCLUSION: Yoga, specifically the YOCAS program, is a useful treatment for improving sleep quality and reducing sleep medication use among cancer survivors.

23937432	Effects of mind-body therapies on symptom clusters during the menopausal transition.	AIMS: Although most women experience symptom clusters during the menopausal transition and early postmenopause, investigators reporting clinical trial effects for hot flushes often omit co-occurring symptoms. Our aim was to review controlled clinical trials of mind-body therapies for hot flushes and at least one other co-occurring symptom from these groups: sleep, cognitive function, mood, and pain. METHODS: An experienced reference librarian performed an extensive search of PubMed/Medline, CINAHL Plus, PsycInfo, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science, EMBASE, AMED, and Alt-Health Watch for randomized controlled trials reported in English between 2004 and July 2011. Of 1193 abstracts identified, 58 trials examining effectiveness of therapies for hot flushes and at least one additional co-occurring symptom of interest were identified. RESULTS: Eight trials (ten publications) examined relaxation, yoga, or exercise. Physical activity/exercise trials (six) yielded mixed results; only one significantly reduced hot flushes and mood symptoms. Of two relaxation therapy trials, only mindfulness-based stress reduction training reduced sleep and mood symptoms and had within-group treatment effects on hot flushes. Yoga (one trial) significantly reduced hot flushes and improved cognitive symptoms more than exercise, and also had within-group effects on sleep and pain symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Studies of mind-body therapies for hot flushes increasingly measure multiple symptom outcomes, but few report treatment effects in ways that allow clinicians to consider symptom clusters when prescribing therapies. Future studies need to measure and report results for individual symptoms or group like symptoms together into subscales rather than use subscales with mixed dimensions. Trials with larger numbers of participants are essential to allow evaluation of these therapies on multiple co-occurring symptoms.

23935658	Infectious diseases physicians' attitudes and practices related to complementary and integrative medicine: results of a national survey.	Background. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and integrative medicine (IM) modalities are widely used by patients, including those with infectious diseases (ID). Methods. One thousand randomly selected ID practitioners were surveyed. The survey was divided into domains related to familiarity and recommendation, beliefs and attitudes, and use of CAM/IM modalities. Results. The response rate was 31%. ID physicians were most familiar with vitamin and mineral supplementation (83%), massage (80%), acupuncture (79%), chiropractic (77%), yoga (74%), and herbal medicine (72%). ID physicians most recommended vitamin and mineral supplementation (80%) and massage (62%). Yoga, meditation, and acupuncture were recommended by 52%, 45%, and 46%, respectively. Drug interactions, clinical research, and knowledge of CAM/IM modalities were factors that were considered a major influence. Almost 80% of respondents indicated an interest in IM versus 11% for CAM. Most respondents (75%) felt that IM modalities are useful, and more than 50% believed that they could directly affect the immune system or disease process. Conclusion. ID physicians expressed a markedly greater interest for IM versus CAM. They appear to be familiar and willing to recommend some CAM/IM modalities and see a role for these in the management of certain infectious diseases. Data regarding clinical efficacy and safety appear to be important factors.	Shere-Wolfe, Kalpana D;Tilburt, Jon C;D'Adamo, Chris;Berman, Brian;Chesney, Margaret A	2013
23934515	Impact of relaxation training according to the Yoga In Daily Life(R) system on anxiety after breast cancer surgery.	The purpose of this pilot study was to gather information on the immediate and short-term effects of relaxation training according to the Yoga In Daily Life(R) (YIDL(R)) system on anxiety of breast cancer patients. The YIDL(R) system is a holistic system being practised and taught worldwide and has been proven to be highly effective in the prevention and treatment of various diseases. The system aims to establish physical, mental, spiritual, and social health. Thirty-two patients at the Institute for Oncology Ljubljana were randomized to the experimental (n=16) and to the control groups (n=16). Both groups received the same standard physiotherapy for 1 week, while the experimental group additionally received 1-hour group relaxation training session according to the YIDL(R) system per day. At discharge, the experimental group was issued with audiocassette recordings containing similar instructions for relaxation training to be practiced for 3 weeks individually at home. Anxiety measures were obtained by blinded assessors using standardized questionnaires. The results indicate that relaxation training according to the YIDL(R) system could be a useful clinical physiotherapy intervention for breast cancer patients experiencing anxiety.

23934220	Yoga for rheumatic diseases: a systematic review.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendation for yoga as an ancillary intervention in rheumatic diseases. METHODS: Medline/PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Library and IndMED were searched through February 2013. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing yoga with control interventions in patients with rheumatic diseases were included. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane Back Review Group risk of bias tool. The quality of evidence and the strength of the recommendation for or against yoga were graded according to the GRADE recommendations. RESULTS: Eight RCTs with a total of 559 subjects were included; two RCTs had a low risk of bias. In two RCTs on FM syndrome, there was very low evidence for effects on pain and low evidence for effects on disability. In three RCTs on OA, there was very low evidence for effects on pain and disability. Based on two RCTs, very low evidence was found for effects on pain in RA. No evidence for effects on pain was found in one RCT on CTS. No RCT explicitly reported safety data. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this review, only weak recommendations can be made for the ancillary use of yoga in the management of FM syndrome, OA and RA at this point.

23932244	Effects of yoga therapy on postural stability in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders: a single-blind randomized controlled trial.	INTRODUCTION: Postural instability is a serious concern in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders since it is expected to increase the risk of falls that may lead to fractures. The impact of yoga therapy on postural stability has not been investigated. METHODS: In this eight-week single-blind randomized controlled study with an eight-week follow-up, outpatients with schizophrenia or related psychotic disorder (ICD-10) were randomly assigned to either yoga therapy or a control group. In the yoga therapy group, the subjects received weekly sessions of 60-min yoga therapy for eight weeks in addition to their ongoing treatment. In the control group, the subjects received a weekly regular day-care program. The assessments that were performed at the baseline and endpoint included the Clinical Stabilometric Platform (CSP), anteflexion in standing. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients participated in this study (32 men; mean +/- SD age, 53.1 +/- 12.3 years): yoga therapy group (n = 25) and control group (n = 24). In the yoga group, significant improvements were observed in a total length of trunk motion, the Romberg ratio, and anteflexion in standing at week 8 (mean +/- SD: 63.9 +/- 40.7-53.4 +/- 26.2 cm, 1.6 +/- 0.9-1.1 +/- 0.6, and -8.7 +/- 9.5 to -3.8 +/- 12.4 cm, respectively) while there were no significant changes in the control group. However, those clinical gains returned to the baseline level at week 16. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirmed the beneficial effects of the yoga therapy on postural stability in patients with schizophrenia. However, the therapeutic effects seemed transient, which warrants further investigations on strategies to sustain the improvements.

23930033	Can yoga be used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease?	Yoga methods including Pranayama are the best ways to prevent many diseases and their progression. Even though, Yoga is widely practiced, its effects on certain medical conditions have not been studied or reported. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of them. GERD is extremely common condition requiring frequent consumption of over-the-counter or prescribed proton pump inhibitors (PPI). In severe symptoms of GERD and in the presence of multiple etiologies, PPIs are insufficient to relieve the symptoms of gastric reflux. Regular and proper use of the Yoga along with PPI can control the severe symptoms of GERD and can avoid or delay the necessity of invasive procedures. This evidence-based case report focuses on the effects of Yoga on GERD. Our case report showed that regular practice of Kapalbhati and Agnisar kriya along with PPI, patients with hiatal hernia had improvement in severe symptoms of GERD, which were initially refractory to PPI alone.

23930032	Effect of kapalabhati on performance of six-letter cancellation and digit letter substitution task in adults.	BACKGROUND: Attention and concentration are valuable skills for all fields of human activity. Training to improve these skills is described in ancient hatha yoga texts. AIMS: To study the effect of 1-min Kapalabhati (KB1) and 5-min Kapalabhati (KB5) practice of the Yoga rapid breathing exercise, Kapalabhati (KB), on psychomotor performance, as measured by the six-letter cancellation task (SLCT) and digit-letter substitution task (DLST). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six subjects, 21 male (mean age 25.71 years, SD 2.10), 15 female (mean age 24.13 years, SD 2.23) participated in the study. All were participating in a 3-month pranayama training program, part of residential degree courses at Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana, Yoga University. The subjects were divided into two groups, and assessed on the SLCT and DLST, immediately before and after KB on two successive days. The first group did KB1 on day 1, and KB5 on day 2. For the second group, the order was reversed. RESULTS: There were no significant differences on SLCT and DLST on Total and Net Scores between sessions for the same group, and between groups for the same session i.e. the effects of KB1 and KB5 were not distinguishable. However, both groups made more errors on DLST after the interventions, 525% after KB1 and 562.5% after KB5, P < 0.018 and P < 0.041, respectively (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test). In contrast, scores on SLCT remained completely unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Both KB1 and KB5 found no change on both SLCT and DLST. But, this kind of breathing practices leads to increases error score.

23930031	Additional effect of iyengar yoga and EMG biofeedback on pain and functional disability in chronic unilateral knee osteoarthritis.	BACKGROUND: There are limited data about Iyengar Yoga and EMG biofeedback in knee OA, although the efficacy of EMG biofeedback in the rehabilitation of patients with quadriceps muscle weakness secondary to immobilization, contracture, and joint surgery has been well established. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty subjects who have fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected and divided into two groups (Group A and B). Both the groups were treated with EMG biofeedback, knee muscle strengthening exercises, and TENS. Group A received additionally Iyengar Yoga for 8 weeks. Both groups were evaluated by Visual Analog Scale and Modified WOMAC-Western Ontario McMaster Universities Scale. RESULTS: Patients in both groups experienced significant reduction in pain and improvement in functional ability. In VAS scale Group A showed reduction of 56.83% (P = 0.001) when compared with Group B 38.15% (P </= 0.001). In modified WOMAC Scale, Group A showed reduction of 59.21% (P = 0.001) when compared with Group B 34.08% (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Adding Iyengar Yoga along with conventional therapy provides better results in chronic unilateral knee osteoarthritis in terms of pain and functional disability.

23930030	Efficacy of certain yogic and naturopathic procedures in premature ejaculation: A pilot study.	CONTEXT: Premature ejaculation (PE) is the most common sexual disorder of young males. Even though there are number of treatment options available for PE, patient's satisfaction and drug side effects remain to be a problem. Non-pharmacological treatment options like Yoga and Naturopathy have been implicated in sexual fulfillment, pleasure and efficacy of some of these approaches has been established in previous studies. AIM: To assess the efficacy of certain yogic and naturopathic procedures in the management of PE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 12 patients with PE satisfying the DSM IV TR diagnostic criteria were selected and allotted into two groups, Yoga group and Naturopathic group by following the randomization method. In the Yoga group, various asanas, mudra, bandha and pranayama were practiced 1 hour daily for 21 days. In the Naturopathy group, lower abdomen massage and steam bath, hip bath and lingasnana, mud pack on lower abdomen, and acupressure were done 1 hour daily for 21 days. Criteria of assessment were based on the scoring of Premature Ejaculation Severity Index (PESI). Statistical analysis was done by using paired and unpaired "t" tests. RESULTS: In the Yoga group (n = 6), 7.3% relief was observed (P < 0.01) and in the Naturopathy group (n = 6), 2.4% of relief was observed (P > 0.05) on the total score of PESI. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) found in between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Both Yoga and Naturopathic procedures didn't provide relief (<25%) on total score of PESI.

23930029	Mindfulness-based stress reduction program in coronary heart disease: A randomized control trial.	BACKGROUND: Psychological risk factors such as anxiety and depression have been associated with coronary heart disease (CHD). Stress can have an impact on the risk factors for the disease, such as high blood pressure (BP), physical inactivity and being overweight. AIMS: Examine the effect of the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program on symptoms of anxiety and depression, perceived stress, BP and body mass index (BMI) in patients with CHD. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Intervention was carried out at an Outpatient clinic. Parallel group - MBSR group; and treatment-as-usual group (TAU) - randomized control design with pre- (baseline), post-intervention and follow-up assessments was adopted. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty male patients, age range (30-65 years) with CHD were randomly allocated to either group. The therapeutic program comprised of eight weekly sessions of structured MBSR intervention for the MBSR group and one health education session for the TAU group. Regular medical intervention and monthly consultations with the cardiologist were consistent for both groups. The main outcome measures were: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Perceived Stress Scale (perceived stress), BP and BMI. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Independent sample t-tests, chi square test and paired sample t-test were used. RESULTS: All patients completed intervention in the MBSR group. Significant reduction was observed in symptoms of anxiety and depression, perceived stress, BP and BMI in patients of the MBSR group after the completion of intervention assessment. At 3-month follow-up, therapeutic gains were maintained in patients of the MBSR group. CONCLUSION: The MBSR program is effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression, perceived stress, BP and BMI in patients with CHD.	Parswani, Manish J;Sharma, Mahendra P;Iyengar, Ss	2013 Jul
23930028	Effect of fast and slow pranayama on perceived stress and cardiovascular parameters in young health-care students.	CONTEXT: Perceived stress is higher for students in various healthcare courses. Previous studies have shown that pranayama practice is beneficial for combating stress and improve cardiovascular functions but both fast and slow pranayama practice produce different physiological responses. AIM: Present study was conducted to compare the effects of commonly practiced slow and fast pranayama on perceived stress and cardiovascular functions in young health-care students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Present study was carried out in Departments of Physiology and Advanced Centre for Yoga Therapy Education and Research, JIPMER, Pondicherry. Ninety subjects (age 18-25 years) were randomized to fast pranayama (Group 1), slow pranayama (Group 2) and control group (Group 3). Group 1 subjects practiced Kapalabhati, Bhastrika and Kukkuriya Pranayama while Group 2 subjects practiced Nadishodhana, Savitri and Pranav Paranayama. Supervised pranayama training was given for 30 min, 3 times a week for the duration of 12 weeks to Groups 1 and 2 subjects by certified yoga trainer. Following parameters were recorded at the baseline and after 12 weeks of training; perceived stress scale (PSS), heart rate (HR), respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), rate pressure product (RPP), and double product (Do P). RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in PSS scores in both Group 1 and Group 2 subjects but percentage decrease was comparable in these groups. Significant decrease in HR, DBP, RPP, and Do P was seen in only Group 2 subjects. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that both types of pranayama practice are beneficial in reducing PSS in the healthy subjects but beneficial effect on cardiovascular parameters occurred only after practicing slow pranayama.

23930027	A comparative study of the effects of asan, pranayama and asan-pranayama training on neurological and neuromuscular functions of Pondicherry police trainees.	BACKGROUND: Though neurological benefits of yoga training have been reported, lacunae still exists in understanding neurophysiological effects of such training. Hence, the present study was conducted to find the effect of yogasanas and pranayams on neurological and neuromuscular functions in healthy human volunteers and also determined differential effects of training in asan, pranayama and their combination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty male trainees from Pondicherry Police Training School were randomly divided into asan, pranayama, and asan-pranayama groups who received a training of 4 days a week for 6 months and a control group. Electroencephalogram (EEG), nerve conduction (NC), electromyogram (EMG), visual evoked potentials (VEP), and auditory reaction time (ART) were recorded before and after the study period. NC, EMG, and VEP data were obtained from 28 subjects; EEG data from 48 subjects; and RT from 67 subjects. Intergroup differences were assessed by AVOVA/Kruskal-Wallis and intragroup differences by Student's t-test. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Police trainees showed beneficial effects of yoga training, although they were undergoing intensive police training and the yoga training was relatively less intense. Alpha, theta, and total power of EEG increased as a result of asan training. A shortening of visual reaction time and a decrease in red-green discriminatory reaction time signifies an improved and faster processing of visual input. They also showed a decrease in resting EMG voltage, signifying better muscular relaxation following pranayama training. Beta, theta and total power of EEG increased. ART and red-green discriminatory reaction times decreased in the trainees, signifying a more alert state as well as improved central neural processing. A combination of asan and pranayama training for 6 months produced an improvement in motor and sensory nerve conduction. Total power of EEG, alpha and theta power as well as delta % increased, while reaction time decreased signifying an alert and yet relaxed state of the neuromuscular system. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION: The present study has shown that 6 months training in asan, pranayama as well as their combination is effective in improving physiological functions of police trainees. They showed beneficial effects of yoga training, although they were undergoing intensive police training and the yoga training was relatively less intense. Hence, we recommend that yoga training be introduced in police training curricula.	Trakroo, Madanmohan;Bhavanani, Ananda Balayogi;Pal, Gopal Krushna;Udupa, Kaviraja;Krishnamurthy, N	2013 Jul
23930026	Male reproductive health and yoga.	Now-a-days reproductive health problems along with infertility in male is very often observed. Various Assisted Reproductive Technologies have been introduced to solve the problem, but common people cannot afford the cost of such procedures. Various ayurvedic and other alternative medicines, along with regular yoga practice are proven to be not only effective to enhance the reproductive health in men to produce a successful pregnancy, but also to regulate sexual desire in men who practice celibacy. Yoga is reported to reduce stress and anxiety, improve autonomic functions by triggering neurohormonal mechanisms by the suppression of sympathetic activity, and even, today, several reports suggested regular yoga practice from childhood is beneficial for reproductive health. In this regard the present review is aimed to provide all the necessary information regarding the effectiveness of yoga practice to have a better reproductive health and to prevent infertility.

23929995	Performance in attentional tasks following meditative focusing and focusing without meditation.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Ancient Indian yoga texts have described four mental states. These are caicalata (random thinking), ekagrata (focusing without meditation), dharana (meditative focusing), and dhyana (defocused meditative expansiveness). A previous study compared the performance in a cancellation task at the beginning and end of each of the four mental states (practiced for 20 minutes each, on four separate days) showed an increase in the scores after dharana Hence, the present study was designed to assess the effects of dharana (meditative focusing) and ekagrata (focusing without meditation) on two attention tasks (i) d2 test of attention and (ii) digit symbol substitution test. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty normal healthy male volunteers with ages ranging from 17 to 38 years (group mean age +/- S.D., 24.87 +/- 4.95) were studied. Assessments were made before and after the practice of ekagrata and dharana on two separate days. RESULTS: After both types of focusing, there was a significant improvement in all measures of the d2 test of attention (TN, E, TN-E, E%, and CP). However, the performance in the digit symbol substitution test was better after dharana but did not change after ekagrata. CONCLUSIONS: Hence, in summary, dharana (meditative focusing) and ekagrata (focusing without meditation) produce nearly comparable results though dharana (meditative focusing) results in better incidental learning and better accuracy (as assessed by the substitution task).

23929992	Development of a chewable tablet from Dugdhamalakyadi Yoga: An Ayurvedic preparation.	BACKGROUND: Amalaki (Embelica officinalis Gaertn.) is one of the most celebrated herbs in the Indian system of traditional medicine. It is one of the best Rasayana-s (health promoting) drug. In Dugdhamalakyadi yoga, Amalaki (Embelica officinalis Gaertn.) powder is administered along with milk in case of svarabhanga (hoarseness of voice). Here an attempt is made to convert this formulation into chewable tablet without altering its property to improve its palatability, shelf life and fixation of proper therapeutic dose. METHODOLOGY: Chewable tablets were prepared by wet granulation method. Here, Amalaki powder was prepared initially and it was mixed with additives and preservatives. Granules were prepared from this mixture by adding binding agent, finally compressed in to tablets. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The physico-chemical analysis of Amalaki standard are: Foreign Matter-Nil, Acid insoluble Ash-0.51%w/w, Water soluble Ash-2.01% w/w, Alcoholic Extractives-44.48%, Aqueous Extractives 67.52%, pH-3.1, Moisture content-8.19%. Quality control test for chewable tablet was carried out and found satisfactory with general characteristics of tablet viz. hardness 1.8, disintegration time 15-20 min, friability 0.5%, weight variation +/- 3%. The TLC of Amalaki powder showed 3 spots with Rf value 0.14, 0.4, and 0.73 and the chewable tablets showed 2 spots with Rf value 0.31 and 0.89 under 254 nm. The adaptation of modern techniques or methods to convert the Ayurvedic formulations without altering its therapeutic property is necessary to made them suitable for the present trends of newer drug delivery dosage forms.

23929045	A yoga program for the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder in veterans.	The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of a yoga program as an adjunctive therapy for improving post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in Veterans with military-related PTSD. Veterans (n = 12) participated in a 6 week yoga intervention held twice a week. There was significant improvement in PTSD hyperarousal symptoms and overall sleep quality as well as daytime dysfunction related to sleep. There were no significant improvements in the total PTSD, anger, or quality of life outcome scores. These results suggest that this yoga program may be an effective adjunctive therapy for improving hyperarousal symptoms of PTSD including sleep quality. This study demonstrates that the yoga program is acceptable, feasible, and that there is good adherence in a Veteran population.	Staples, Julie K;Hamilton, Michelle F;Uddo, Madeline	2013 Aug
23925803	Effects of yoga exercise on salivary beta-defensin 2.	PURPOSE: Yoga stretching can be done comfortably and easily by beginners and older adults to compensate for lack of exercise or poor health maintenance. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of yoga stretching on mucosal immune functions, primarily human beta-defensin 2 (HBD-2) in saliva. METHODS: Fifteen healthy adults (age, 60.4 +/- 8.0 years) participated in the study. Participants rested for 90 min on the first day and performed yoga for 90 min on the second day. Measurements were carried out before and after rest or yoga. Saliva samples were collected by chewing a sterile cotton at a frequency of 60 cycles per min. Salivary HBD-2 concentration was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: HBD-2 concentration after yoga stretching (165.4 +/- 127.1 pg/mL) was significantly higher than that before yoga stretching (84.1 +/- 63.4 pg/mL; p < 0.01). HBD-2 expression rate after yoga stretching (232.8 +/- 192.9 pg/min) was significantly higher than that before yoga stretching (110.7 +/- 96.8 pg/min; p < 0.01). HBD-2 concentration (p < 0.05) and HBD-2 expression rate (p < 0.01) at post on the second day (yoga) was significantly higher than that on the first day (rest). POMS score of anger-hostility was lower after yoga than before. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga stretching for 90 min can increase salivary HBD-2 expression in older adults. Therefore, yoga stretching might be useful for older adults and athletes to maintain their health.	Eda, Nobuhiko;Shimizu, Kazuhiro;Suzuki, Satomi;Tanabe, Yoko;Lee, Eunjae;Akama, Takao	2013 Oct
23922582	The effect of yoga on coping strategies among intensive care unit nurses.	INTRODUCTION: Nowadays, it has been known that individuals handle coping strategies when faced with stressful events. These strategies play an important role in individuals. Nurses are exposed to high stress, which directly affects their job satisfaction and the quality of their services. Therefore, the present study tried to investigate the effect of Yoga on stress coping strategies among nurses working in intensive care units (ICUs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this quasi-experimental study, 34 female nurses working in ICU who were qualified to enter the study were selected. Yoga exercises were administrated two sessions a week for 8 weeks in the study group. CS-R questionnaire was filled before and after intervention. The data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential (t test) statistical tests. RESULTS: The results of statistical tests showed that the highest application of stress coping strategies was for inconsistent stress coping strategy. There was a significant difference in the mean scores of coping strategies of stress focus, emotion focus, and ineffectiveness after Yoga exercises compared with those before the yoga sessions. DISCUSSION: With regard to the findings, 8 weeks exercises of Yoga can be considered as a complementary treatment to amend stress coping strategies. Further studies in this field are suggested.

23922209	Yoga for depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Mind-body medical interventions are commonly used to cope with depression and yoga is one of the most commonly used mind-body interventions. The aim of this review was to systematically assess and meta-analyze the effectiveness of yoga for depression. METHODS: Medline/PubMed, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and IndMED were searched through January 2013. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of yoga for patients with depressive disorders and individuals with elevated levels of depression were included. Main outcomes were severity of depression and remission rates, secondary outcomes were anxiety, quality of life, and safety. RESULTS: Twelve RCTs with 619 participants were included. Three RCTs had low risk of bias. Regarding severity of depression, there was moderate evidence for short-term effects of yoga compared to usual care (standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.99, -0.39; P < .001), and limited evidence compared to relaxation (SMD = -0.62; 95%CI -1.03, -0.22; P = .003), and aerobic exercise (SMD = -0.59; 95% CI -0.99, -0.18; P = .004). Limited evidence was found for short-term effects of yoga on anxiety compared to relaxation (SMD = -0.79; 95% CI -1.3, -0.26; P = .004). Subgroup analyses revealed evidence for effects in patients with depressive disorders and in individuals with elevated levels of depression. Due to the paucity and heterogeneity of the RCTs, no meta-analyses on long-term effects were possible. No RCT reported safety data. CONCLUSIONS: Despite methodological drawbacks of the included studies, yoga could be considered an ancillary treatment option for patients with depressive disorders and individuals with elevated levels of depression.

23918953	Randomized controlled trial of Mindfulness-based cancer recovery versus supportive expressive group therapy for distressed survivors of breast cancer.	PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of the following two empirically supported group interventions to help distressed survivors of breast cancer cope: mindfulness-based cancer recovery (MBCR) and supportive-expressive group therapy (SET). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This multisite, randomized controlled trial assigned 271 distressed survivors of stage I to III breast cancer to MBCR, SET, or a 1-day stress management control condition. MBCR focused on training in mindfulness meditation and gentle yoga, whereas SET focused on emotional expression and group support. Both intervention groups included 18 hours of professional contact. Measures were collected at baseline and after intervention by assessors blind to study condition. Primary outcome measures were mood and diurnal salivary cortisol slopes. Secondary outcomes were stress symptoms, quality of life, and social support. RESULTS: Using linear mixed-effects models, in intent-to-treat analyses, cortisol slopes were maintained over time in both SET (P = .002) and MBCR (P = .011) groups relative to the control group, whose cortisol slopes became flatter. Women in MBCR improved more over time on stress symptoms compared with women in both the SET (P = .009) and control (P = .024) groups. Per-protocol analyses showed greater improvements in the MBCR group in quality of life compared with the control group (P = .005) and in social support compared with the SET group (P = .012). CONCLUSION: In the largest trial to date, MBCR was superior for improving stress levels, quality of life and social support [CORRECTED] for distressed survivors of breast cancer. Both SET and MBCR also resulted in more normative diurnal cortisol profiles than the control condition. The clinical implications of this finding require further investigation.

23906102	Effects of yoga interventions on fatigue in cancer patients and survivors: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials.	BACKGROUND: Fatigue is one of the most frequently reported, distressing side effects reported by cancer survivors and often has significant long-term consequences. Research indicates that yoga can produce invigorating effects on physical and mental energy, and thereby may improve levels of fatigue. The objective of this systematic review was to examine the literature that reports the effects of randomized, controlled yoga interventions on self-reported fatigue in cancer patients and survivors. The online electronic databases, PubMed and PsycINFO, were used to search for peer-reviewed research articles studying the effects of yoga interventions on fatigue in cancer survivors. Combinations of yoga, cancer, and fatigue-related search terms were entered simultaneously to obtain articles that included all three elements. Studies were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: participants were male or female cancer patients or survivors participating in randomized, controlled yoga interventions. The main outcome of interest was change in fatigue from pre- to post-intervention. Interventions of any length were included in the analysis. Risk of bias using the format of the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias was also examined across studies. RESULTS: Ten articles met inclusion criteria and involved a total of 583 participants who were predominantly female, breast cancer survivors. Four studies indicated that the yoga intervention resulted in significant reductions in self-reported fatigue from pre- to post-intervention. Three of the studies reported that there were significant reductions of fatigue among participants who attended a greater number of yoga classes. Risk of bias was high for areas of adequate selection, performance, detection, and patient-reported bias and mixed for attrition and reporting bias. Risk of bias was uniformly low for other forms of bias, including financial conflicts of interest. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the studies included in this review suggest that yoga interventions may be beneficial for reducing cancer-related fatigue in women with breast cancer; however, conclusions should be interpreted with caution as a result of levels of bias and inconsistent methods used across studies. More well-constructed randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the impact of yoga interventions on fatigue in cancer patients and survivors.	Sadja, Julie;Mills, Paul J	2013 Jul-Aug
23899008	Effects of yoga on sexual function in women with metabolic syndrome: a randomized controlled trial.	INTRODUCTION: Female sexual dysfunction is an important public health issue; it has a high global prevalence, but no effective and safe treatment options. The prevalence of sexual dysfunction is higher in women with metabolic syndrome than in the general population. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of yoga as a treatment for sexual dysfunction in women with metabolic syndrome. METHODS: In this randomized, controlled study, 41 women with metabolic syndrome (age 30-60 years) were assigned to a 12-week yoga exercise group (n=20) or a wait-listed control group (n=21). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary end points were changes in total and individual domain scores on the Female Sexual Function Index. RESULTS: The 12-week yoga intervention resulted in significant improvement in arousal (0.74+/-1.18 vs. 0.16+/-0.82, respectively; P=0.042) and lubrication (0.72+/-1.12 vs. 0.06+/-0.87, respectively; P=0.008) compared with the control group. Systolic blood pressure showed significantly greater improvement in the yoga group than in the control group at the 12-week follow up (-3.5+/-13.7 vs. 2.0+/-14.7, respectively; P=0.040). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that yoga may be an effective treatment for sexual dysfunction in women with metabolic syndrome as well as for metabolic risk factors.

23898306	Meditative movement for depression and anxiety.	This review focuses on Meditative Movement (MM) and its effects on anxiety, depression, and other affective states. MM is a term identifying forms of exercise that use movement in conjunction with meditative attention to body sensations, including proprioception, interoception, and kinesthesis. MM includes the traditional Chinese methods of Qigong (Chi Kung) and Taijiquan (Tai Chi), some forms of Yoga, and other Asian practices, as well as Western Somatic practices; however this review focuses primarily on Qigong and Taijiquan. We clarify the differences between MM and conventional exercise, present descriptions of several of the key methodologies of MM, and suggest how research into these practices may be approached in a systematic way. We also present evidence for possible mechanisms of the effects of MM on affective states, including the roles of posture, rhythm, coherent breathing, and the involvement of specific cortical and subcortical structures. We survey research outcomes summarized in reviews published since 2007. Results suggest that MM may be at least as effective as conventional exercise or other interventions in ameliorating anxiety and depression; however, study quality is generally poor and there are many confounding factors. This makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions at this time. We suggest, however, that more research is warranted, and we offer specific suggestions for ensuring high-quality and productive future studies.	Payne, Peter;Crane-Godreau, Mardi A	2013
23896331	There is not yet strong evidence that exercise regimens other than pelvic floor muscle training can reduce stress urinary incontinence in women: a systematic review.	QUESTION: What evidence is there for alternative exercises to specific pelvic floor muscle training for treatment of stress urinary incontinence in women? DESIGN: A systematic review was conducted with searches of PubMed and PEDro to January 2013. The quality of randomised trials was evaluated using the PEDro scale. Each type of exercise was classified as being in a Development Phase, Testing Phase, or Refinement and Dissemination Phase. PARTICIPANTS: Women with stress or mixed urinary incontinence with predominantly stress urinary incontinence. INTERVENTION: Exercise regimens other than pelvic floor muscle training. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was urinary leakage. RESULTS: Seven randomised controlled trials were found: three on abdominal training, two on the Paula method, and two on Pilates exercise. The methodological quality score ranged between 4 and 8 with a mean of 5.7. There was no convincing evidence for the effect of these exercise regimens so they remain in the Testing Phase. Because no randomised trials were found for posture correction, breathing exercise, yoga, Tai Chi, and general fitness training, these were classified as being in the Development Phase. CONCLUSION: There is not yet strong evidence that alternative exercise regimens can reduce urinary leakage in women with stress urinary incontinence. Alternative exercise regimens should not yet be recommended for use in clinical practice for women with stress urinary incontinence.	Bo, Kari;Herbert, Robert D	2013 Sep
23894731	Yoga for chronic low back pain: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of yoga as an intervention for chronic low back pain (CLBP) using a meta-analytical approach. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined pain andor functional disability as treatment outcomes were included. Post-treatment and follow-up outcomes were assessed. METHODS: A comprehensive search of relevant electronic databases, from the time of their inception until November 2011, was conducted. Cohen's d effect sizes were calculated and entered in a random-effects model. RESULTS: Eight RCTs met the criteria for inclusion (eight assessing functional disability and five assessing pain) and involved a total of 743 patients. At post-treatment, yoga had a medium to large effect on functional disability (d=0.645) and pain (d=0.623). Despite a wide range of yoga styles and treatment durations, heterogeneity in post-treatment effect sizes was low. Follow-up effect sizes for functional disability and pain were smaller, but remained significant (d=0.397 and d=0.486, respectively); however, there was a moderate to high level of variability in these effect sizes. DISCUSSION: The results of the present study indicate that yoga may be an efficacious adjunctive treatment for CLBP. The strongest and most consistent evidence emerged for the short-term benefits of yoga on functional disability. However, before any definitive conclusions can be drawn, there are a number of methodological concerns that need to be addressed. In particular, it is recommended that future RCTs include an active control group to determine whether yoga has specific treatment effects and whether yoga offers any advantages over traditional exercise programs and other alternative therapies for CLBP.

23888383	Susceptibility to the rubber hand illusion does not tell the whole body-awareness story.	The rubber hand illusion (RHI) is an enigmatic illusion that creates a feeling of owning an artificial limb. Enthusiasts of this paradigm assert that it operationalizes bodily self-awareness, but there are reasons to doubt such a clear link. Because little is known about other functional contributions to the RHI, including effects of context-dependent visual processing and cognitive control or the ability to resolve intermodal conflict, we carried out two complementary experiments. In the first, we examined the relationships between the RHI and (1) body awareness, as assessed by the Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ); (2) context-dependent visual processing, as assessed by the rod-and-frame test (RFT); and (3) conflict resolution, as assessed by the Stroop test. We found a significant positive correlation between the RHI-associated proprioceptive drift and context-dependent visual processing on the RFT, but not between the RHI and body awareness on the BPQ. In the second experiment, we examined the RHI in advanced yoga practitioners with an embodied lifestyle and a heightened sense of their own body in space. They succumbed to the illusion just as much as did yoga-naive control participants, despite significantly greater body awareness on the BPQ. These findings suggest that susceptibility to the RHI and awareness of one's own body are at least partially independent processes.	David, Nicole;Fiori, Francesca;Aglioti, Salvatore M	2014 Mar
23882106	Meditative movement for respiratory function: a systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Meditative movement, such as tai chi, yoga, and qi gong, may benefit people with cystic fibrosis (CF), as a form of gentle exercise incorporating meditation, breathing, and relaxation. Respiratory function is the most common issue in CF. In this systematic review we synthesized the evidence on the effect of meditative movement on respiratory function in patients with CF. METHODS: We searched Chinese and English language databases with terms relating to tai chi/yoga/qi gong, and respiratory function/cough/dyspnea. Articles were screened and selected by 2 researchers. We included controlled studies published in English or Chinese after 1980, and extracted data using a specially designed spreadsheet. Two researchers independently evaluated study quality and reporting, using 3 standardized checklists. Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneous methods. RESULTS: We found 1,649 papers, included 43 (30 in English, 13 in Chinese), 23 of which were randomized controlled trials, and 20 were non-randomized trials. No studies were concerned with CF. Eleven studies included patients with respiratory disorders, and 27 included healthy people. Very few studies were high quality. The main problems with the randomized controlled trials was the randomization and non-random and/or poorly reported sampling. The main problems with the non-randomized studies were poor reporting of samples and non-equivalent groups. Although no clinically important changes were found, meditative movement may improve FEV1 in healthy people, compared to no treatment/exercise (the intervention groups showed effect-size changes from 0.07 to 0.83), but meditative movement did not appear to affect FEV1/FVC in subjects with COPD. Key study limitations were: poor reporting of sampling or methods; inadequate sample size; non-randomized design; inadequate description of randomization; randomization by center; no blinding; lack of reporting of important aspects of meditative movement; and short-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence does not support meditative movement for patients with CF, and there is very limited evidence for respiratory function in healthy populations. The available studies had heterogeneous populations and provided inadequate sampling information, so clinically relevant conclusions cannot be drawn. Well powered, randomized studies of meditative movement are needed.	Lorenc, Ava B;Wang, Yuyi;Madge, Susan L;Hu, Xiaoyang;Mian, Awais M;Robinson, Nicola	2014 Mar
23878604	Comparing Once- versus Twice-Weekly Yoga Classes for Chronic Low Back Pain in Predominantly Low Income Minorities: A Randomized Dosing Trial.	Background. Previous studies have demonstrated that once-weekly yoga classes are effective for chronic low back pain (cLBP) in white adults with high socioeconomic status. The comparative effectiveness of twice-weekly classes and generalizability to racially diverse low income populations are unknown. Methods. We conducted a 12-week randomized, parallel-group, dosing trial for 95 adults recruited from an urban safety-net hospital and five community health centers comparing once-weekly (n = 49) versus twice-weekly (n = 46) standardized yoga classes supplemented by home practice. Primary outcomes were change from baseline to 12 weeks in pain (11-point scale) and back-related function (23-point modified Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire). Results. 82% of participants were nonwhite; 77% had annual household incomes <$40,000. The sample's baseline mean pain intensity [6.9 (SD 1.6)] and function [13.7 (SD 5.0)] reflected moderate to severe back pain and impairment. Pain and back-related function improved within both groups (P < 0.001). However, there were no differences between once-weekly and twice-weekly groups for pain reduction [-2.1 (95% CI -2.9, -1.3) versus -2.4 (95% CI -3.1, -1.8), P = 0.62] or back-related function [-5.1 (95% CI -7.0, -3.2) versus -4.9 (95% CI -6.5, -3.3), P = 0.83]. Conclusions. Twelve weeks of once-weekly or twice-weekly yoga classes were similarly effective for predominantly low income minority adults with moderate to severe chronic low back pain. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01761617.	Saper, Robert B;Boah, Ama R;Keosaian, Julia;Cerrada, Christian;Weinberg, Janice;Sherman, Karen J	2013
23878424	Impact of short term yoga intervention on mental well being of medical students posted in community medicine: a pilot study.	BACKGROUND: High level of stress, anxiety and depression is seen among medical students. AIMS: To assess the impact of brief structured yoga intervention on mental well being of MBBS students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The participants consisted of 82 MBBS students of 3(rd) semester in the age group of 18-23 years. The students were assessed at baseline and at the end of one month of specific yoga intervention by using General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28). RESULTS: The students reported improvement in general and mental well being following the intervention and difference was found to be highly significant. CONCLUSION: A short term specific yoga intervention may be effective in improving general and mental well being in MBBS students. It is feasible and practical to include yoga practice in block postings of community medicine.	Bansal, Rahul;Gupta, Monika;Agarwal, Bhaskar;Sharma, Sachin	2013 Apr
23876573	The effect of complementary and alternative medicine on the quality of life of cancer survivors: a systematic review and meta-analyses.	PURPOSE: To assess whether quality of life (QOL) improved in cancer survivors who had undertaken a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) intervention, compared to cancer survivors who had not. METHODS: A systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was undertaken. Electronic databases including MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL, PSYCHINFO, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from 1990 to 2012. Search terms incorporating the concepts of cancer survivors, QOL and various types of CAM were used. RESULTS: From 1767 records retrieved and screened 13 full text articles were included in the review. Nine studies were deemed to have a high risk, one a low risk, and three an unclear risk of bias. CAM interventions used incorporated yoga, meditation or mindfulness, energy healing, medical qigong, homoeopathy, or mistletoe therapy. Ten of the studies used breast cancer survivors, whilst the remaining three included other cancer types. The studies had mixed results either showing a significantly greater improvement in QOL in the intervention group compared to the control group, or no significant difference between groups. However, twelve studies were of low to moderate quality, limiting the robustness of findings. CONCLUSIONS: This review has identified significant gaps in the evidence base for the effectiveness of CAM on QOL in cancer survivors. Further work in this field needs to adopt more rigorous methodology to help support cancer survivors to actively embrace self-management and effective CAMs, without recommending inappropriate interventions which are of no proven benefit.

23876562	National survey of yoga practitioners: mental and physical health benefits.	OBJECTIVES: To describe yoga practice and health characteristics of individuals who practice yoga, and to explore their beliefs regarding the effects of their yoga practice on their health. DESIGN: A cross-sectional design with anonymous online surveys. SETTING: 4307 randomly selected individuals from 15 US Iyengar yoga studios (n=18,160), representing 41 states; 1087 individuals responded, with 1045 (24.3%) surveys completed. OUTCOME MEASURES: Freiberg Mindfulness Inventory, Mental Health Continuum (subjective well-being), Multi-factor Screener (diet), PROMIS sleep disturbance, fatigue, and social support, International Physical Activity Questionnaire. RESULTS: Age: 19-87 years (M=51.7 +/- 11.7), 84.2% female, 89.2% white, 87.4% well educated (>/= bachelor's degree). Mean years of yoga practice=11.4 (+/- 7.5). BMI=12.1-49.4 (M=23.1 +/- 3.9). Levels of obesity (4.9%), smoking (2%), and fruit and vegetable consumption (M=6.1 +/- 1.1) were favorable compared to national norms. 60% reported at least one chronic/serious health condition, yet most reported very good (46.3%) or excellent (38.8%) general health. Despite high levels of depression (24.8%), nearly all were moderately mentally healthy (55.2%) or flourishing (43.8%). Participants agreed yoga improved: energy (84.5%), happiness (86.5%), social relationships (67%), sleep (68.5%), and weight (57.3%), and beliefs did not differ substantially according to race or gender. The more they practiced yoga, whether in years or in amount of class or home practice, the higher their odds of believing yoga improved their health. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals who practice yoga are not free of health concerns, but most believe their health improved because of yoga. Yoga might be beneficial for a number of populations including elderly women and those with chronic health conditions.	Ross, Alyson;Friedmann, Erika;Bevans, Margaret;Thomas, Sue	2013 Aug
23869306	Cardiac autonomic function in patients with diabetes improves with practice of comprehensive yogic breathing program.	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to observe the effect comprehensive yogic breathing (Sudarshan Kriya Yoga [SKY] and Pranayam) had on cardiac autonomic functions in patients with diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective randomized controlled intervention trial. Cardiac autonomic functions were assessed in 64 diabetics. Patients were randomized into two groups, one group receiving standard therapy for diabetes and the other group receiving standard therapy for diabetes and comprehensive yogic breathing program. Standard therapy included dietary advice, brisk walking for 45 min daily, and administration of oral antidiabetic drugs. Comprehensive yogic breathing program was introduced to the participants through a course of 12 h spread over 3 days. It was an interactive session in which SKY, a rhythmic cyclical breathing, preceded by Pranayam is taught under the guidance of a certified teacher. Cardiac autonomic function tests were done before and after 6 months of intervention. RESULTS: In the intervention group, after practicing the breathing techniques for 6 months, the improvement in sympathetic functions was statistically significant (P 0.04). The change in sympathetic functions in the standard therapy group was not significant (P 0.75). Parasympathetic functions did not show any significant change in either group. When both parasympathetic and sympathetic cardiac autonomic functions were considered, there was a trend toward improvement in patients following comprehensive yogic breathing program (P 0.06). In the standard therapy group, no change in cardiac autonomic functions was noted (P 0.99). CONCLUSION: Cardiac autonomic functions improved in patients with diabetes on standard treatment who followed the comprehensive yogic breathing program compared to patients who were on standard therapy alone.

23867628	Walking or dancing: patterns of physical activity by cross-sectional age among U.S. women.	OBJECTIVES: To identify age differences in physical activity (PA) participation for women. METHODS: Data from 3,952 women 25+ from the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) were used to analyze participation patterns for 17 PA types. RESULTS: The top five leisure PAs by participation rate for all ages were walking (42%), dancing (20%), treadmill (15%), biking (11%), and yoga (10%). Participation in running, dancing, treadmill, and team sports declined around ages 35 to 44, and participation in household PA, walking, weightlifting, and hiking declined around ages 55 to 64. At age 75+ further substantial decline in most activities occurred. Nativity status was the most important moderator for age-related PA decline. CONCLUSIONS: Total PA declines with age but significant decline does not occur until ages 55 to 64. Major decline in leisure PA participation starts earlier at ages 35 to 44. While age-related declining patterns differ for different activities, the top five most popular leisure activities are similar for all age groups.

23866738	Participation in a 10-week course of yoga improves behavioural control and decreases psychological distress in a prison population.	BACKGROUND: Yoga and meditation have been shown to be effective in alleviating symptoms of depression and anxiety in healthy volunteers and psychiatric populations. Recent work has also indicated that yoga can improve cognitive-behavioural performance and control. Although there have been no controlled studies of the effects of yoga in a prison population, we reasoned that yoga could have beneficial effects in a setting where psychosocial functioning is often low, and the frequency of impulsive behaviours is high. METHODS: Participants were recruited from 7 British prisons and randomly allocated to either a 10-week yoga programme (yoga group; 1 class per week; N = 45) or a control group (N = 55). Self-report measures of mood, stress, and psychological distress were collected before and after the intervention period. Participants completed a cognitive-behavioural task (Go/No-Go) at the end of the study, which assessed behavioural response inhibition and sustained attention. RESULTS: Participants in the yoga group showed increased self-reported positive affect, and reduced stress and psychological distress, compared to participants in the control group. Participants who completed the yoga course also showed better performance in the cognitive-behavioural task, making significantly fewer errors of omission in Go trials and fewer errors of commission on No-Go trials, compared to control participants. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga may be effective in improving subjective wellbeing, mental health, and executive functioning within prison populations. This is an important consideration given the consistently high rates of psychological morbidity in this group and the need for effective and economical intervention programmes.

23858275	Integrative change model in psychotherapy: Perspectives from Indian thought.	Different psychotherapeutic approaches claim positive changes in patients as a result of therapy. Explanations related to the change process led to different change models. Some of the change models are experimentally oriented whereas some are theoretical. Apart from the core models of behavioral, psychodynamic, humanistic, cognitive and spiritually oriented models there are specific models, within psychotherapy that explains the change process. Integrative theory of a person as depicted in Indian thought provides a common ground for the integration of various therapies. Integrative model of change based on Indian thought, with specific reference to psychological concepts in Upanishads, Ayurveda, Bhagavad Gita and Yoga are presented. Appropriate psychological tools may be developed in order to help the clinicians to choose the techniques that match the problem and the origin of the dimension. Explorations have to be conducted to develop more techniques that are culturally appropriate and clinically useful. Research has to be initiated to validate the identified concepts.

23858273	Ayurvedic concepts related to psychotherapy.	The perfect balance of mind, body and soul is considered as complete health in Ayurveda. Ayurveda has its own identity as most ancient and traditional System of Medicine in India. Even Ayurveda emphasizes its treatment modalities into three parts viz. Satwawajay Chikitsa, Yuktivyapashray and Daivyapashray Chikitsa. Sattvavajaya therapy mentioned in Charakasamhita and it used as new concept of psychotherapy in Ayurveda. The effectiveness of "traditional mental health promoting practices" was identified as health regimens (swasthvrtt), correct behavior (sadvrtt), and yoga. Sattvavajaya as psychotherapy, is the mental restraint, or a "mind control" as referred by Caraka, is achieved through "spiritual knowledge, philosophy, fortitude, remembrance and concentration. Ayurvedic psychotherapy would play a dual role: First, as a revival of authentic medical culture, the exercise of a practice with an assumed primordial dimension, and second as a discovery of authentic subjectivity, the revelation of a self with an assumed interior depth. When we integrate the contemporary art of psychotherapy with the ancient science of Ayurveda, it becomes a powerful combination that is called Psycho Veda. The integration of Psycho and Veda is motivated by the complete integration of the immense but fairly contemporary view of the mind, emotions and psyche and how this performs in our lives. Integrating Psychotherapy and Vedic principles teaches us how to rediscover critical knowledge and awareness of the natural forces and rhythms that compliment and strengthen our human experience, through the understanding of the psyche and what our inner experiences are and also involving practical daily activities with thorough attention to our total environment to bring about radical changes in our mental outlook and in physical health.

23858258	The Islamic prayer (Salah/Namaaz) and yoga togetherness in mental health.	Religion and its practices have been duly implicated in treating not only problems related to medical health, rather, intervening and preventing such problems as well. In the present article, the authors have reviewed significance of the Islamic prayers (Salah/Namaaz) in healthcare in general and mental health in particular. The nature, procedures, practices and the benefits of Salah have been comprehensively described and discussed. In addition, an attempt to combine yoga and its practices with Salah has been made for intervening and preventing the problems of mental health as an expeditious tool. In upshot, the clinicians in the field of mental health care have been suggested to incorporate these two viewpoints in their intervention program, at least, for the Muslim patients for a more desirable outcome.

23858252	Mind and consciousness in yoga - Vedanta: A comparative analysis with western psychological concepts.	Study of mind and consciousness through established scientific methods is often difficult due to the observed-observer dichotomy. Cartesian approach of dualism considering the mind and matter as two diverse and unconnected entities has been questioned by oriental schools of Yoga and Vedanta as well as the recent quantum theories of modern physics. Freudian and Neo-freudian schools based on the Cartesian model have been criticized by the humanistic schools which come much closer to the vedantic approach of unitariness. A comparative analysis of the two approaches is discussed.	Prabhu, H R Aravinda;Bhat, P S	2013 Jan
23858248	Clinical hypnosis and Patanjali yoga sutras.	The trance states in yoga and hypnosis are associated with similar phenomena like relaxation, disinclination to talk, unreality, misrepresentation, alterations in perception, increased concentration, suspension of normal reality testing, and the temporary nature of the phenomena. While some researchers consider yoga to be a form of hypnosis, others note that there are many similarities between the trance in yoga and the hypnotic trance. The present study aimed to find similarities between the trance states of hypnosis and Patanjali's yoga sutras. The trance states were compared with the understanding of the phenomena of trance, and the therapeutic techniques and benefits of both. An understanding of the concept of trance in Patanjali's yoga sutras was gained through a thematic analysis of the book Four Chapters on Freedom by Swami Satyananda Saraswati. This led to an understanding of the concept of trance in the yoga sutras. The obtained concepts were compared to the concepts of trance in hypnosis (obtained through the literature on hypnosis) to investigate whether or not there exist similarities. The findings of the study show that there are similarities between the trance in hypnosis and the trance in Patanjali's yoga sutras in the induction and deepening of the trance states in hypnosis and that of Samadhi, the phenomena present in hypnosis and the kinds of siddhis that are obtained through Samadhi, and the therapeutic techniques and the therapeutic process in Patanjali's yoga sutra and hypnosis.

23858247	Emotions: An Indian perspective.	The present paper is an attempt to understand emotions and the affect from Indian traditional point of view. In the Indian philosophical texts' detailed descriptions of emotions are not available nor are dealt with as a separate concept. This view of emotions lays emphasis on desires as the root cause of emotional upheavals. They are seen as modification of desire and attachment. The desires are seen as arising from the contact and attachment of the ego or ahamkara with the external world and are caused by a sense of imperfection, incompleteness or non-fulfillment. Ego or ahamkara is differentiated from the true Self or atman. Emotions are viewed as springs of action and are bipolar in nature. According to Patanjali's Yoga Shastra, suffering is due to ignorance about one's true "self" (avidya). Hence, suffering or dukha arises from within and not from the outside world. Bhagvadgita traces all emotional experiences to the gunas, i.e., sattva, rajas, and tamas. Works of Bharathmuni have contributed to the understanding of emotional experiences. Concept of rasa or aesthetic relish is central to this approach to understanding affective experiences as dealt with in the Natyashastra of Bharathamuni. These views underline the recommended path for self-transformation. Regulating emotions, both emotional experience and emotional expression, is an integral part of the recommended "principles of living."	Ramaprasad, Dharitri	2013 Jan
23858246	Karma yoga: A path towards work in positive psychology.	Karma yoga is the path that leads to salvation through action. Salvation is the ultimate state of consciousness. Work is the central and defining characteristic of life. It may have intrinsic value, instrumental value, or both. Instrumental value includes incentive, dignity and power, etc., which is the result expected from the work. The Gita teaches us to do work without thinking of result (work with intrinsic value). Attachment with the result leads to stress, competition and aggression. Stress further gives rise to heart ailments, depression and suicide. Positive psychology studies the factors and conditions leading to pleasurable and satisfying life. Understanding Karma yoga and its practice has a similar role that lead an individual towards work and leading to a satisfied life. This may play a unique role towards practical aspects of positive psychology to improve one's lifestyle and aid in the treatment of stress disorders.	Kumar, Arun;Kumar, Sanjay	2013 Jan
23858245	Yoga school of thought and psychiatry: Therapeutic potential.	Yoga is a traditional life-style practice used for spiritual reasons. However, the physical components like the asanas and pranayaamas have demonstrated physiological and therapeutic effects. There is evidence for Yoga as being a potent antidepressant that matches with drugs. In depressive disorder, yoga 'corrects' an underlying cognitive physiology. In schizophrenia patients, yoga has benefits as an add-on intervention in pharmacologically stabilized subjects. The effects are particularly notable on negative symptoms. Yoga also helps to correct social cognition. Yoga can be introduced early in the treatment of psychosis with some benefits. Elevation of oxytocin may be a mechanism of yoga effects in schizophrenia. Certain components of yoga have demonstrated neurobiological effects similar to those of vagal stimulation, indicating this (indirect or autogenous vagal stimulation) as a possible mechanism of its action. It is time, psychiatrists exploited the benefits if yoga for a comprehensive care in their patients.	Rao, Naren P;Varambally, Shivarama;Gangadhar, Bangalore N	2013 Jan
23858244	Indianization of psychiatry utilizing Indian mental concepts.	Most of the psychiatry practice in India is guided by the western concepts of mental health and illness, which have largely ignored the role of religion, family, eastern philosophy, and medicine in understanding and managing the psychiatric disorders. India comprises of diverse cultures, languages, ethnicities, and religious affiliations. However, besides these diversities, there are certain commonalities, which include Hinduism as a religion which is spread across the country, the traditional family system, ancient Indian system of medicine and emphasis on use of traditional methods like Yoga and Meditation for controlling mind. This article discusses as to how mind and mental health are understood from the point of view of Hinduism, Indian traditions and Indian systems of medicine. Further, the article focuses on as to how these Indian concepts can be incorporated in the practice of contemporary psychiatry.	Avasthi, Ajit;Kate, Natasha;Grover, Sandeep	2013 Jan
23849906	Women's use of complementary and alternative medicines during pregnancy: a cross-sectional study.	OBJECTIVE: to determine the prevalence of women's use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) during pregnancy in the UK, reasons for use, who recommended CAM, and the characteristics of women that are associated with use of CAM during pregnancy. DESIGN: cross-sectional questionnaire. SETTING: Birmingham Women's Hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 315 postnatal women were surveyed while on the postnatal ward. FINDINGS: the questionnaire response rate was 89% (315/355). CAM use during pregnancy was reported by 180 women (57.1%). CAM users differed significantly from non-CAM users by education level, parity and previous CAM use before pregnancy. Vitamins (34.9%), massage therapy (14.0%), yoga (11.1%) and relaxation (10.2%) were the most commonly reported uses of CAM. 33.0% of women reported they did not disclose their use of CAM to a doctor or midwife, and 81.3% were not asked by their doctor or midwife about their use of CAM during pregnancy. KEY CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: this study found a high prevalence of CAM use during pregnancy, which is within the range of findings of studies from Australia and Germany. It is important that health-care providers routinely ask about CAM use during pregnancy and are able to provide pregnant women with appropriate advice regarding CAM use.

23849549	Predictors of yoga use among internal medicine patients.	BACKGROUND: Yoga seems to be an effective means to cope with a variety of internal medicine conditions. While characteristics of yoga users have been investigated in the general population, little is known about predictors of yoga use and barriers to yoga use in internal medicine patients. The aim of this cross-sectional analysis was to identify sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological predictors of yoga use among internal medicine patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted among all patients being referred to a Department of Internal and Integrative Medicine during a 3-year period. It was assessed whether patients had ever used yoga for their primary medical complaint, the perceived benefit, and the perceived harm of yoga practice. Potential predictors of yoga use including sociodemographic characteristics, health behavior, internal medicine diagnosis, general health status, mental health, satisfaction with health, and health locus of control were assessed; and associations with yoga use were tested using multiple logistic regression analysis. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for significant predictors. RESULTS: Of 2486 participants, 303 (12.19%) reported having used yoga for their primary medical complaint. Of those, 184 (60.73%) reported benefits and 12 (3.96%) reported harms due to yoga practice. Compared to yoga non-users, yoga users were more likely to be 50-64 years old (OR = 1.45; 95%CI = 1.05-2.01; P = 0.025); female (OR = 2.45; 95%CI = 1.45-4.02; P < 0.001); and college graduates (OR = 1.61; 95%CI = 1.14-2.27; P = 0.007); and less likely to currently smoke (OR = 0.61; 95%CI = 0.39-0.96; P = 0.031). Manifest anxiety (OR = 1.47; 95%CI = 1.06-2.04; P = 0.020); and high internal health locus of control (OR = 1.92; 95%CI = 1.38-2.67; P < 0.001) were positively associated with yoga use, while high external-fatalistic health locus of control (OR = 0.66; 95%CI = 0.47-0.92; P = 0.014) was negatively associated with yoga use. CONCLUSION: Yoga was used for their primary medical complaint by 12.19% of an internal integrative medicine patient population and was commonly perceived as beneficial. Yoga use was not associated with the patients' specific diagnosis but with sociodemographic factors, mental health, and health locus of control. To improve adherence to yoga practice, it should be considered that male, younger, and anxious patients and those with low internal health locus of control might be less intrinsically motivated to start yoga.

23846823	Effects of exercise training on airway hyperreactivity in asthma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Although physical exercise is recommended for asthmatics, evidence on the effects of exercise on clinical key factors is still missing. OBJECTIVES: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effect of exercise training (EXT) on quality of life (QoL), bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), lung function and exercise capacity, plus the factors affecting changes in QoL and exercise capacity in asthmatics after a period of EXT. DATA SOURCES: A computerized search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL (last search on 15 November 2012), without language restriction, and references of original studies and reviews were searched for further relevant studies. STUDY SELECTION: Two independent investigators screened full-text studies with asthmatic subjects undertaking EXT (defined as training for >/=7 days, >/=2 times per week, >/=5 training sessions in total) that assessed at least one of the following outcomes: QoL, airway hyperreactivity, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)), peak expiratory flow (PEF), inflammatory parameters, exercise capacity, or exercise endurance. Potentially relevant studies were excluded if only respiratory muscle training, breathing exercises or yoga was performed, if asthmatic subjects with co-morbidities were investigated, if only data of mixed patient groups without separate results for asthmatics were presented, if training regimens were not sufficiently specified, if no numerical outcome data were presented, and if new long-term medication was introduced in addition to physical training. Of 500 potentially relevant articles, 13.4 % (67 studies including 2,059 subjects) met the eligibility criteria and were included for further analyses. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Data extraction and risk of bias assessment was performed according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. A meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed to determine the effect of EXT on asthma symptoms, BHR, EIB, FEV(1), exercise capacity and exercise endurance compared with control training. In addition, relative pre/post changes were analysed in all RCTs and controlled trials. Finally, multiple linear regression models were used to identify effects of relative changes in airway hyperreactivity (BHR or EIB), lung function (FEV(1) or PEF) and training hours on QoL and exercise performance. RESULTS: In a total of 17 studies including 599 subjects, meta-analyses showed a significant improvement in days without asthma symptoms, FEV1 and exercise capacity while BHR only tended to improve. The analysis of relative within-group changes after EXT showed, however, significant improvements in QoL (17 %), BHR (53 %), EIB (9 %), and FEV1 (3 %) compared with control conditions. Multiple linear regression models revealed that changes in airway hyperreactivity and lung function significantly contributed to the change in QoL, while mainly the changes in airway hyperreactivity contributed to the change in exercise capacity. CONCLUSION: EXT was shown to improve asthma symptoms, QoL, exercise capacity, BHR, EIB, and FEV1 in asthmatics and improvements in BHR explained part of the improvement in QoL and exercise capacity. Thus, physical activity should be recommended as a supplementary therapy to medication. However, more well controlled studies should be performed assessing the relationship of physical activity, QoL, airway hyperreactivity, lung function and especially airway inflammation as well as medication intake.

23842021	Neuropsychiatric symptoms and the use of mind-body therapies.	OBJECTIVE: Neuropsychiatric symptoms affect 37% of US adults and present in many important diagnoses including posttraumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, and chronic pain. However, these symptoms are difficult to treat with standard treatments, and patients may seek alternative options. In this study, we examined the use of mind-body therapies by adults with neuropsychiatric symptoms. METHOD: We compared mind-body therapy use (biofeedback, energy healing, meditation, guided imagery, yoga, deep-breathing exercises, hypnosis, progressive relaxation therapy, qigong, and tai chi) between adults with and without neuropsychiatric symptoms (anxiety, depression, insomnia, headaches, memory deficits, attention deficits, and excessive daytime sleepiness) in the 2007 National Health Interview Survey (N = 23,393). Use of >/= 1 of these therapies in the prior 12 months was the primary outcome of interest. We also examined prevalence and reasons for mind-body therapy use in adults with neuropsychiatric symptoms. We performed logistic regression to examine the association between neuropsychiatric symptoms and mind-body therapy use to adjust for sociodemographic and clinical factors. RESULTS: Adults with >/= 1 neuropsychiatric symptom used mind-body therapies more than adults without symptoms (25.3% vs 15.0%, P < .001). Prevalence increased with increasing number of symptoms (21.5% for 1 symptom, 32.4% for >/= 3 symptoms, P < .001); differences persisted after adjustment for potential confounders (odds ratios, 1.39 [95% CI, 1.26-1.53] and 2.48 [95% CI, 2.18-2.82]). Reasons for mind-body therapy use among adults with >/= 1 symptom included the ineffectiveness or expense of conventional medicine (30.2%). Most adults (nearly 70%) with >/= 1 symptom did not discuss their mind-body therapy use with a conventional provider. CONCLUSIONS: Adults with >/= 1 neuropsychiatric symptom use mind-body therapies frequently; more symptoms are associated with increased use. Future research is needed to understand the efficacy of these therapies.	Purohit, Maulik P;Wells, Rebecca Erwin;Zafonte, Ross;Davis, Roger B;Yeh, Gloria Y;Phillips, Russell S	2013 Jun
23840263	Quality of life and mental health in patients with chronic diseases who regularly practice yoga and those who do not: a case-control study.	While clinical trials have shown evidence of efficacy of yoga in different chronic diseases, subjective health benefits associated with yoga practice under naturalistic conditions have not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate associations of regular yoga practice with quality of life and mental health in patients with chronic diseases. Using a case-control design, patients with chronic diseases who regularly practiced yoga were selected from a large observational study and compared to controls who did not regularly practice yoga and who were matched individually to each case on gender, main diagnosis, education, and age (within 5 years). Patients' quality of life (SF-36 questionnaire), mental health (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), life satisfaction, and health satisfaction (Questionnaire for Life Satisfaction) were assessed. Patients who regularly practiced yoga (n = 186) had a better general health status (P = 0.012), a higher physical functioning (P = 0.001), and physical component score (P = 0.029) on the SF-36 than those who did not (n = 186). No group differences were found for the mental scales of the SF-36, anxiety, depression, life satisfaction, or health satisfaction. In conclusion, practicing yoga under naturalistic conditions seems to be associated with increased physical health but not mental health in chronically diseased patients.

23835773	Effects of inspiratory muscle training and yoga breathing exercises on respiratory muscle function in institutionalized frail older adults: a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: In older adults, respiratory function may be seriously compromised when a marked decrease of respiratory muscle (RM) strength coexists with comorbidity and activity limitation. Respiratory muscle training has been widely studied and recommended as a treatment option for people who are unable to participate in whole-body exercise training (WBET); however, the effects of inspiratory muscle training and yoga breathing exercises on RM function remain unknown, specifically in impaired older adults. PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of inspiratory threshold training (ITT) and yoga respiratory training (YRT) on RM function in institutionalized frail older adults. METHODS: Eighty-one residents (90% women; mean age, 85 years), who were unable to perform WBET (inability to independently walk more than 10 m), were randomly assigned to a control group or one of the 2 experimental groups (ITT or YRT). Experimental groups performed a supervised interval-based training protocol, either through threshold inspiratory muscle training device or yoga breathing exercises, which lasted 6 weeks (5 days per week). Outcome measures were collected at 4 time points (pretraining, intermediate, posttraining, and follow-up) and included the maximum respiratory pressures (maximum inspiratory pressure [MIP] and maximum expiratory pressure [MEP]) and the maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV). RESULTS: Seventy-one residents completed the study: control (n = 24); ITT (n = 23); YRT (n = 24). The treatment on had a significant effect on MIP YRT (F(6,204) = 6.755, P < .001, eta2 = 0.166), MEP (F(6,204) = 4.257, P < .001, eta2 = 0.111), and MVV (F(6,204) = 5.322, P < .001, eta2 = 0.135). Analyses showed that the YRT group had a greater increase of RM strength (MIP and MEP) and endurance (MVV) than control and/or ITT groups. CONCLUSION: Yoga respiratory training appears to be an effective and well-tolerated exercise regimen in frail older adults and may therefore be a useful alternative to ITT or no training, to improve RM function in older population, when WBET is not possible.

23833514	Stress: Neurobiology, consequences and management.	Stress, both physical and psychological, is attracting increasing attention among neuroresearchers. In the last 20 decades, there has been a surge of interest in the research of stress-induced manifestations and this approach has resulted in the development of more appropriate animal models for stress-associated pathologies and its therapeutic management. These stress models are an easy and convenient method for inducing both psychological and physical stress. To understand the behavioral changes underlying major depression, molecular and cellular studies are required. Dysregulation of the stress system may lead to disturbances in growth and development, and may this may further lead to the development of various other psychiatric disorders. This article reviews the different types of stress and their neurobiology, including the different neurotransmitters affected. There are various complications associated with stress and their management through various pharmacological and non-pharmacological techniques. The use of herbs in the treatment of stress-related problems is practiced in both Indian and Western societies, and it has a vast market in terms of anti-stress medications and treatments. Non-pharmacological techniques such as meditation and yoga are nowadays becoming very popular as a stress-relieving therapy because of their greater effectiveness and no associated side effects. Therefore, this review highlights the changes under stress and stressor and their impact on different animal models in understanding the mechanisms of stress along with their effective and safe management.

23832181	Community level morbidity control of lymphoedema using self care and integrative treatment in two lymphatic filariasis endemic districts of South India: a non randomized interventional study.	BACKGROUND: Currently there is no global program to manage lymphoedema as a result of lymphatic filariasis (LF). The primary aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of a previously proposed integrative treatment protocol, using locally available resources to address the morbidity, in a community village setting. METHODS: Two LF endemic districts of south India, Gulbarga in Karnataka (GK) and Alleppey in Kerala (AK), were selected for the study. All known patients were invited to an LF camp. Patients with grade two late or three lymphoedema were enrolled. All patients were given training in the integrative procedure which involved patient education and the domiciliary protocol. RESULTS: A total of 730 patients (851 limbs) completed the three and half month follow up. There was a statistically significant (1%) reduction up to mid thigh level volume measurement for both small (0.7-1.1 liters) and large (1.8-5.0 liters) limbs, p < 0.000. In AK inflammatory episodes at the three months interval reduced from 37.5% (127 patients) to 28.3% (96 patients) and in GK from 37.6% (147 patients) to 10.2% (40 patients), p < 0.000. All patients had reduced bacterial entry points. There was an overall improvement in quality of life in all domains of LF specific quality of life questionnaire p < 0.000. CONCLUSIONS: Self care and integrative treatment is possible in resource poor Indian village settings. Further work is needed to explore factors leading to better compliance by randomizing the interventions such as washing and emollient compression vs Ayurvedic and yoga interventions before integrative treatment is considered for national health programmes in developing countries.

23828333	Using a standardized Viniyoga protocol for lung cancer survivors: a pilot study examining effects on breathing ease.	Although lung cancer is perceived as a dire diagnosis, increases in the 5-year survival rate of individuals with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been reported. Survivors, however, continue to be excessively burdened with symptoms such as respiratory distress which interfere with functioning and quality of life. While exercise and physical activity are strongly recommended, NSCLC survivors may be reluctant to participate due to actual or anticipated shortness of breath exacerbated with movement.This quasi-experimental, intervention-only pilot study aimed to determine the effects of an 8-week standardized yoga protocol for Stage I-IIIa NSCLC survivors (n=9). The protocol was developed within the Viniyoga (Hatha) tradition with respiratory experts. Breathing ease, dyspnea, oxygen saturation, and respiratory function were explored in relationship to yoga practice (45-minute sessions once per week and home practice) using repeated-measures analysis. Number of participants reporting dyspnea ranged from 25 to 50% prior to practice with no significant increase during sessions, and moderate decreases noted at times. Oxygen saturation remained high and vital signs stable; forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) values increased significantly over the 14-week study period (p<0.0001). Yoga, with an emphasis on postures coordinated with breathing and meditation practices, offers a potentially feasible and beneficial option that requires further study in this population.

23826882	A systematic review of physical therapy interventions for patients with anorexia and bulemia nervosa.	PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was to summarise the evidence from randomised controlled trials examining the effectiveness of physical therapy compared with care as usual or a wait-list condition on eating pathology and on physiological and psychological parameters in patients with anorexia and bulimia nervosa. METHOD: EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Physiotherapy Evidence Database and The Cochrane Library were searched from their inception until February, 2013. Articles were eligible if they utilised a randomised controlled trial design, compared physical therapy with a placebo condition, control intervention, or standard care and included patients with anorexia and bulimia nervosa. The methodological quality was assessed with the Jadad scale. RESULTS: Eight randomised controlled trials involving 213 patients (age range: 16-36 years) met all selection criteria. Three of the 8 included studies were of strong methodological quality (Jadad score>/=3). Major methodological weaknesses were attrition and selection bias. The main results demonstrate that aerobic and resistance training result in significantly increased muscle strength, body mass index and body fat percentage in anorexia patients. In addition, aerobic exercise, yoga, massage and basic body awareness therapy significantly lowered scores of eating pathology and depressive symptoms in both anorexia and bulimia nervosa patients. No adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The paucity and heterogeneity of available studies limits overall conclusions and highlights the need for further research. Implications for Rehabilitation Supervised physical therapy might increase weight in anorexia nervosa patients. Aerobic exercise, massage, basic body awareness therapy and yoga might reduce eating pathology in patients with anorexia and bulimia nervosa. Aerobic exercise, yoga and basic body awareness therapy might improve mental and physical quality of life in patients with an eating disorder.

23825035	A 12-week Iyengar yoga program improved balance and mobility in older community-dwelling people: a pilot randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Exercise that challenges balance can improve mobility and prevent falls in older adults. Yoga as a physical activity option for older adults is not well studied. This trial evaluated the feasibility and effect of a 12-week Iyengar yoga program on balance and mobility in older people. METHODS: We conducted a blinded, pilot randomized controlled trial with intention-to-treat analysis. Participants were 54 community dwellers (mean age 68 years, SD 7.1) not currently participating in yoga or tai chi. The intervention group (n = 27) participated in a 12-week, twice-weekly yoga program focused on standing postures and received a fall prevention education booklet. The control group (n = 27) received the education booklet only. Primary outcome was standing balance component of the short physical performance battery with addition of one-legged stance time (standing balance). Secondary outcomes were the timed sit-to-stand test, timed 4-m walk, one-legged stand with eyes closed, and Short Falls Efficacy Scale-International. Feasibility was measured by recording class attendance and adverse events. RESULTS: Fifty-two participants completed follow-up assessments. The intervention group significantly improved compared with control group on standing balance (mean difference = 1.52 seconds, 95% CI 0.10-2.96, p = .04), sit-to-stand test (mean difference = -3.43 seconds, 95% CI -5.23 to -1.64, p < .001), 4-m walk (mean difference = -0.50 seconds, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.28, p < .001), and one-legged stand with eyes closed (mean difference = 1.93 seconds, 95% CI 0.40-3.46, p = .02). Average class attendance was 20 of 24 classes (83%). No serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: This trial demonstrates the balance and mobility-related benefits and feasibility of Iyengar yoga for older people. The fall prevention effect of Iyengar yoga warrants further investigation.	Tiedemann, Anne;O'Rourke, Sandra;Sesto, Romina;Sherrington, Catherine	2013 Sep

23805925	"A feeling of connectedness": perspectives on a gentle yoga intervention for women with major depression.	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common and debilitating health conditions in women in the United States and worldwide. Many women with MDD seek out complementary therapies for their depressive symptoms, either as an adjunct or alternative to the usual care. The purpose of this study is to understand the experiences of women who participated in a yoga intervention for their depression. The findings from this interpretive phenomenological study are derived from interviews with and daily logs by 12 women with MDD who took part in an 8-week gentle yoga intervention as part of a larger parent randomized, controlled trial. Results show that the women's experience of depression involved stress, ruminations, and isolation. In addition, their experiences of yoga were that it served as a self-care technique for the stress and ruminative aspects of depression and that it served as a relational technique, facilitating connectedness and shared experiences in a safe environment. Future long-term research is warranted to evaluate these concepts as potential mechanisms for the effects of yoga for depression.

23800638	A qualitative study on the perceptions of preventing falls as a health priority among older people in Northern India.	BACKGROUND: In India, fall-related injury morbidity and mortality is an emerging public health problem in older people. Despite awareness of a growing burden, there is a scarcity of literature on effective and acceptable interventions. This study was undertaken to explore the perceptions of older people regarding the risk of falls and understanding of fall prevention programmes. METHODS: We conducted six focus group discussions (FGDs), comprising single gender for three socio-demographic groups in a north Indian city, Chandigarh, in 2011. FGDs were conducted in local language (Punjabi), recorded, transcribed and translated in English. Two researchers independently conducted thematic analysis. RESULTS: Focus group participants were aware of the devastating consequences of fall-related injuries. The predominant reasons for explaining an increased risk of falling was age, uneven surfaces, physical weakness and mental health. There were several other competing health priorities in this population. Preventive measures ranging from individual to government level initiatives were suggested. The experience, knowledge, perceptions and health priorities were diverse among the three socio-demographic groups. However, the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness for improving balance and strength using yoga in this population needs to be evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Careful consideration of health priorities is required for development of falls prevention, particularly among the urban poor. Further, initiatives that foster community engagement, such as participatory action may increase acceptability of initiatives to prevent fall-related injury among older people in India.

23796847	Cervical spine injury biomechanics: Applications for under body blast loadings in military environments.	BACKGROUND: While cervical spine injury biomechanics reviews in motor vehicle and sports environments are available, there is a paucity of studies in military loadings. This article presents an analysis on the biomechanics and applications of cervical spine injury research with an emphasis on human tolerance for underbody blast loadings in the military. METHODS: Following a brief review of published military studies on the occurrence and identification of field trauma, postmortem human subject investigations are described using whole body, intact head-neck complex, osteo-ligamentous cervical spine with head, subaxial cervical column, and isolated segments subjected to differing types of dynamic loadings (electrohydraulic and pendulum impact devices, free-fall drops). FINDINGS: Spine injuries have shown an increasing trend over the years, explosive devices are one of the primary causal agents and trauma is attributed to vertical loads. Injuries, mechanisms and tolerances are discussed under these loads. Probability-based injury risk curves are included based on loading rate, direction and age. INTERPRETATION: A unique advantage of human cadaver tests is the ability to obtain fundamental data to delineate injury biomechanics and establish human tolerance and injury criteria. Definitions of tolerances of the spine under vertical loads based on injuries have implications in clinical and biomechanical applications. Primary outputs such as forces and moments can be used to derive secondary variables such as the neck injury criterion. Implications are discussed for designing anthropomorphic test devices that may be used to predict injuries in underbody blast environments and improve the safety of military personnel.

23794650	Psychosocial interventions for managing pain in older adults: outcomes and clinical implications.	Interest in the use of psychosocial interventions to help older adults manage pain is growing. In this article, we review this approach. The first section reviews the conceptual background for psychosocial interventions with a special emphasis on the biopsychosocial model of pain. The second section highlights three psychosocial interventions used with older adults: cognitive behavioural therapy, emotional disclosure, and mind-body interventions (specifically mindfulness-based stress reduction and yoga). The final section of the paper highlights important future directions for work in this area.	Keefe, F J;Porter, L;Somers, T;Shelby, R;Wren, A V	2013 Jul
23789249	Mother and baby yoga is good for you.	Mother and baby yoga is becoming more and more popular in the western world, as postpartum mothers discover the benefits of being able to 'work out', bond with their baby and relax, all in one session. Postnatal yoga can offer calm and a sense of wellbeing, helping mothers to improve and stabilise their emotional health and to bond. Additionally the mother is able to focus on her relationship with her baby, rebuild the weakened pelvic floor, strengthen the abdominal muscles and even alleviate back and neck pain. For babies, yoga can aid digestion and alleviate colic; help to strengthen tiny limbs; improve sleep patterns; and enhance their ability to interact with their mother and other people.

23787533	Inguinal hernia in a continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patient practising "Kapal Bhati" therapy.	A 72 years elderly man, diagnosed case of end stage renal disease with hypertension stage II and anemia of chronic disease on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis along with the supportive medicines and yoga therapy mainly Kapal Bhati, presented with slowly increasing swelling in left inguinal region for two months which used to subside in supine position and bulge during coughing, later involved ipsilateral side of scrotum also. Then he was diagnosed having left side direct inguinal hernia. And then switched to hemodialysis followed by hernioplasty. CAPD was started again after two weeks. Though inguinal hernia is common in elderly male with predisposing factors but its development has not been reported in association with Kapal Bhati therapy which has become recently popular therapy for many diseases.

23781660	Effect of short-term and long-term Brahmakumaris Raja Yoga meditation on physiological variables.	Effect of short-term and long-term Brahmakumaris Raja Yoga meditation on physiological variables like heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was evaluated in 100 subjects practicing Raja Yoga meditation. All 100 subjects (33 men and 67 women) were aged 30 years and above (mean age 52.06 +/- 12.76 years). Short-term meditators (STM) (n = 27) practiced Raja Yoga meditation for duration of six months to five years (mean duration 3.37 +/- 1.67 years) and long-term meditators (LTM) (n = 73) practiced Raja Yoga meditation for more than five years (mean duration 11.19 +/- 5.13 years). The participants were asked to meditate and the physiological variables (HR, RR, SBP and DBP) were recorded twice (15 minutes and 30 minutes) after beginning of meditation. Also, the fasting blood sugar was estimated by glucometer. The study subjects did not differ significantly in age and various anthropometric characteristics such as body weight, body mass index, waist-hip ratio and fasting blood sugar. Comparison between STM and LTM showed that the changes from baseline values (from premeditation to post-meditation at 15 and 30 minutes) in LTM were not statistically significant with those in STM (P > 0.05). However, within group differences in LTM revealed that changes in the physiological variables were statistically significant when compared between pre and post meditation both at 15 and 30 minutes. The study suggests that the long-term practice of Raja Yoga meditation improves basic cardio-respiratory functions due to shifting of the autonomic balance in favor of parasympathetic instead of sympathetic system.

23781653	Influence of early rising on performance in tasks requiring attention and memory.	Rising early in the morning has been a prescribed discipline of ancient Indian tradition. While there are no scientific studies comparing early rising volitionally versus circumstantially, selected studies on the latter (rising forcefully) have shown negative impact on an individual's peroformance. Hence the present study was undertaken to assess the influence of early rising (during Brahma-muhurtha) on tasks requiring attention and the ability to recall. Fifty four normal healthy male volunteers, with ages ranging from 16-22 years from a residential school were selected. They were randomly allocated to two groups (Brahma-muhurtha and control). They were assessed on day 1, day 10 and day 20 of the intervention, using a digit letter substitution task and verbal and spatial memory task. The Brahma-muhurtha group were asked to rise before 4:30 am in the morning based on the traditional Indian astrological calculations, while the control group were allowed to wake up just before 7 am which was their regular timing for waking. Brahma-muhurtha group after 20 days showed a significant improvement in the net scores for digit letter substitution task as well as scores for verbal and spatial memory tasks. The control group also showed an improvement in the memory task but not in the task requiring attentional processes. The present study suggests that rising early in the morning as described in ancient Indian tradition influences the process of attention and can improve the ability to recall.

23781266	Effectiveness of yoga for hypertension: systematic review and meta-analysis.	Objectives. To systematically review and meta-analyze the effectiveness of yoga for reducing blood pressure in adults with hypertension and to assess the modifying influences of type and length of yoga intervention and type of comparison group. Methods. Academic Search Premier, AltHealthWatch, BIOSIS/Biological Abstracts, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Natural Standard, and Web of Science databases were screened for controlled studies from 1966 to March 2013. Two authors independently assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Results. All 17 studies included in the review had unclear or high risk of bias. Yoga had a modest but significant effect on systolic blood pressure (SBP) (-4.17 [-6.35, -1.99], P = 0.0002) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (-3.62 [-4.92, -1.60], P = 0.0001). Subgroup analyses demonstrated significant reductions in blood pressure for (1) interventions incorporating 3 basic elements of yoga practice (postures, meditation, and breathing) (SBP: -8.17 mmHg [-12.45, -3.89]; DBP: -6.14 mmHg [-9.39, -2.89]) but not for more limited yoga interventions; (2) yoga compared to no treatment (SBP: -7.96 mmHg [-10.65, -5.27]) but not for exercise. Conclusion. Yoga can be preliminarily recommended as an effective intervention for reducing blood pressure. Additional rigorous controlled trials are warranted to further investigate the potential benefits of yoga.	Hagins, Marshall;States, Rebecca;Selfe, Terry;Innes, Kim	2013
23781259	Yoga and mindfulness as therapeutic interventions for stroke rehabilitation: a systematic review.	Aim. This paper reports a systematic review and critical appraisal of the evidence on the effectiveness of behavioral therapies such as yoga and mindfulness practices for stroke rehabilitation. Background. The experience of stroke can have a negative impact on both psychological and physical health and on quality of life. Yoga and relevant practices are promising therapies that have been used with patients with a variety of conditions. In order to draw conclusions on effectiveness for stroke patients, the evidence requires systematic assessment. Methods. A comprehensive search of major biomedical and complementary medicine databases was conducted. Relevant research was categorized by study type and appraised according to study design. Results. Five randomized controlled clinical trials and four single case studies were found. Additionally, one qualitative research study was identified. Studies reported positive results, including improvements in cognition, mood, and balance and reductions in stress. Modifications to different yoga practices make comparison between studies difficult, and a lack of controlled studies precludes any firm conclusions on efficacy. Conclusion. Yoga and mindfulness could be clinically valuable self-administered intervention options for stroke rehabilitation. Further research is needed to evaluate these specific practices and their suitability in stroke rehabilitation.	Lazaridou, Asimina;Philbrook, Phaethon;Tzika, Aria A	2013
23777242	Complementary and alternative medicine use and benefit finding among cancer patients.	PURPOSE: An increasing number of cancer patients are choosing Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) as an active way to manage the physical, psychological, and spiritual consequences of cancer. This trend parallels a movement to understand how a difficult experience, such as a cancer diagnosis, may help facilitate positive growth, also referred to as benefit finding. Little is known about the associations between the use of CAM and the ability to find benefit in the cancer experience. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of medical oncology outpatients in an urban academic cancer center. Patients completed measures of CAM use and benefit finding following a diagnosis of cancer. A hierarchical regression, adjusting for covariates, was performed to evaluate the unique contribution of CAM use on benefit finding. The relationship between specific CAM modalities and benefit finding was explored. RESULTS: Among 316 participants, 193 (61.3%) reported CAM use following diagnosis. Factors associated with CAM use were female gender (p=0.005); college, or higher, education (p=0.09); breast cancer diagnosis (p=0.016); and being 12 to 36 months post-diagnosis (p=0.017). In the hierarchical regression, race contributed the greatest unique variance to benefit finding (23%), followed by time from diagnosis (18%), and age (14%). Adjusting for covariates, CAM use uniquely accounted for 13% of the variance in benefit finding. Individuals using energy healing and healing arts reported significantly more benefit than nonusers. Special diet, herbal remedies, vitamin use, and massage saw a smaller increase in benefit finding, while acupuncture, chiropractic, homeopathy, relaxation, yoga, and tai chi were not significantly associated with benefit finding. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who used CAM following a cancer diagnosis reported higher levels of benefit finding than those who did not. More research is required to evaluate the causal relationship between CAM use, benefit finding, and better psychosocial well-being.

23775386	Eastern medicine approaches to male infertility.	Male factor is a common cause of infertility and the male partner must be systematically evaluated in the workup of every infertile couple. Various Eastern medical strategies have been tried with variable success. This article describes the clinical effects of Eastern medicine approaches including acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, massage, yoga, tai chi, and qi gong, which could improve the sperm parameters and motility, genital inflammatory conditions, as well as immune system disorders, sexual dysfunction, and varicocele. Acupuncture reduces inflammation, increases sperm motility, improves semen parameters, modulates the immune system, and improves sexual and ejaculatory dysfunction in male infertility. The clinical effects may be mediated via activation of somatic afferent nerves innervating the skin and muscle. Chinese herbal medicines may also exert helpful effects in male infertility, and it is worth noting that some herbal drugs may result in male infertility. Massage also exerts positive effects in male infertility. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of clinical effects are unclear. Tai chi, qi gong, and yoga have not been investigated in male infertility, but it has been reported to regulate endocrine and central or autonomic nervous systems. In conclusion, Eastern medical approaches have beneficial on reproductive effects in male infertility. However, future well-designed, randomized, clinical control trials are needed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and mechanisms of Eastern medical approaches for male infertility.

23769610	Complementary and alternative therapies as add-on to pharmacotherapy for mood and anxiety disorders: a systematic review.	BACKGROUND: Depressed and anxious patients often combine complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies with conventional pharmacotherapy to self-treat symptoms. The benefits and risks of such combination strategies have not been fully evaluated. This paper evaluates the risk-benefit profile of CAM augmentation to antidepressants in affective conditions. METHODS: PubMed was searched for all available clinical reports published in English up to December 2012. Data were evaluated based on graded levels of evidence for efficacy and safety. RESULTS: Generally, the evidence base is significantly larger for depression than for anxiety disorder. In unipolar depression, there is Level 2 evidence for adjunctive sleep deprivation (SD) and Free and Easy Wanderer Plus (FEWP), and Level 3 for exercise, yoga, light therapy (LT), omega-3 fatty acids, S-adenosylmethionine and tryptophan. In bipolar depression, there is Level 1 evidence for adjunctive omega-3s, Level 2 for SD, and Level 3 for LT and FEWP. In anxiety conditions, exercise augmentation has Level 3 support in generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. Though mostly well-tolerated, these therapies can only be recommended as third-line interventions due to the quality of available evidence. LIMITATIONS: Overall, the literature is limited. Studies often had methodological weaknesses, with little information on long-term use and on potential drug-CAM interactions. Many CAM studies were not published in English. CONCLUSIONS: While several CAM therapies show some evidence of benefit as augmentation in depressive disorders, such evidence is largely lacking in anxiety disorders. The general dearth of adequate safety and tolerability data encourages caution in clinical use.	Ravindran, Arun V;da Silva, Tricia L	2013 Sep 25
23768276	Hatha yoga and vascular function: results from cross-sectional and interventional studies.	The aim of this study was to determine the effect of hatha yoga on arterial elasticity and endothelial function. First, a cross-sectional study was performed to determine whether yoga practitioners would demonstrate greater arterial compliance and endothelium-dependent vasodilation than their sedentary peers. Second, an intervention study involving 13 sedentary middle-aged and older adults (51 +/- 7 years) was performed to determine whether 12 weeks of hatha yoga would elicit increases in arterial compliance and endothelial function. In the cross-sectional study involving a total of 34 subjects, there were no group differences in body fatness, blood lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, carotid artery compliance or brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Hemoglobin A1c was lower in yoga practitioners than in sedentary adults (P < 0.05). Total cholesterol and hemoglobin A1c decreased after the intervention (P < 0.05) while carotid artery compliance and brachial artery FMD did not change. The results of both cross-sectional and interventional studies indicate that regular practice of hatha yoga is not associated with improvements in vascular functions.

23766657	Self-reported interoceptive awareness in primary care patients with past or current low back pain.	BACKGROUND: Mind-body interactions play a major role in the prognosis of chronic pain, and mind-body therapies such as meditation, yoga, Tai Chi, and Feldenkrais presumably provide benefits for pain patients. The Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA) scales, designed to measure key aspects of mind-body interaction, were developed and validated with individuals practicing mind-body therapies, but have never been used in pain patients. METHODS: We administered the MAIA to primary care patients with past or current low back pain and explored differences in the performance of the MAIA scales between this and the original validation sample. We compared scale means, exploratory item cluster and confirmatory factor analyses, scale-scale correlations, and internal-consistency reliability between the two samples and explored correlations with validity measures. RESULTS: Responses were analyzed from 435 patients, of whom 40% reported current pain. Cross-sectional comparison between the two groups showed marked differences in eight aspects of interoceptive awareness. Factor and cluster analyses generally confirmed the conceptual model with its eight dimensions in a pain population. Correlations with validity measures were in the expected direction. Internal-consistency reliability was good for six of eight MAIA scales. We provided specific suggestions for their further development. CONCLUSION: Self-reported aspects of interoceptive awareness differ between primary care patients with past or current low back pain and mind-body trained individuals, suggesting further research is warranted on the question whether mind-body therapies can alter interoceptive attentional styles with pain. The MAIA may be useful in assessing changes in aspects of interoceptive awareness and in exploring the mechanism of action in trials of mind-body interventions in pain patients.

23762174	Overview of systematic reviews: yoga as a therapeutic intervention for adults with acute and chronic health conditions.	Objectives. Overview the quality, direction, and characteristics of yoga interventions for treatment of acute and chronic health conditions in adult populations. Methods. We searched for systematic reviews in 10 online databases, bibliographic references, and hand-searches in yoga-related journals. Included reviews satisfy Oxman criteria and specify yoga as a primary intervention in one or more randomized controlled trials for treatment in adults. The AMSTAR tool and GRADE approach evaluated the methodological quality of reviews and quality of evidence. Results. We identified 2202 titles, of which 41 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and 26 systematic reviews satisfied inclusion criteria. Thirteen systematic reviews include quantitative data and six papers include meta-analysis. The quality of evidence is generally low. Sixteen different types of health conditions are included. Eleven reviews show tendency towards positive effects of yoga intervention, 15 reviews report unclear results, and no, reviews report adverse effects of yoga. Yoga appears most effective for reducing symptoms in anxiety, depression, and pain. Conclusion. Although the quality of systematic reviews is high, the quality of supporting evidence is low. Significant heterogeneity and variability in reporting interventions by type of yoga, settings, and population characteristics limit the generalizability of results.

23762132	Affect and mindfulness as predictors of change in mood disturbance, stress symptoms, and quality of life in a community-based yoga program for cancer survivors.	Little attention has been paid to the psychological determinants by which benefits are accrued via yoga practice in cancer-related clinical settings. Using a longitudinal multilevel modeling approach, associations between affect, mindfulness, and patient-reported mental health outcomes, including mood disturbance, stress symptoms, and health-related quality of life (HRQL), were examined in an existing seven-week yoga program for cancer survivors. Participants (N = 66) were assessed before and after the yoga program and at three- and six-month follow-ups. Decreases in mood disturbance and stress symptoms and improvements in HRQL were observed upon program completion. Improvements in mood disturbance and stress symptoms were maintained at the three- and six-month follow-ups. HRQL exhibited further improvement at the three-month follow-up, which was maintained at the six-month follow-up. Improvements in measures of well-being were predicted by initial positive yoga beliefs and concurrently assessed affective and mindfulness predictor variables. Previous yoga experience, affect, mindfulness, and HRQL were related to yoga practice maintenance over the course of the study.

23760428	Methods for the design of vasomotor symptom trials: the menopausal strategies: finding lasting answers to symptoms and health network.	OBJECTIVE: This report describes the Menopausal Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers to Symptoms and Health network and methodological issues addressed in designing and implementing vasomotor symptom trials. METHODS: Established in response to a National Institutes of Health request for applications, the network was charged with conducting rapid throughput randomized trials of novel and understudied available interventions postulated to alleviate vasomotor and other menopausal symptoms. Included are descriptions of and rationale for criteria used for interventions and study selection, common eligibility and exclusion criteria, common primary and secondary outcome measures, consideration of placebo response, establishment of a biorepository, trial duration, screening and recruitment, statistical methods, and quality control. All trial designs are presented, including the following: (1) a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor escitalopram in reducing vasomotor symptom frequency and severity; (2) a two-by-three factorial design trial to test three different interventions (yoga, exercise, and omega-3 supplementation) for the improvement of vasomotor symptom frequency and bother; and (3) a three-arm comparative efficacy trial of the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine and low-dose oral estradiol versus placebo for reducing vasomotor symptom frequency. The network's structure and governance are also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The methods used in and the lessons learned from the Menopausal Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers to Symptoms and Health trials are shared to encourage and support the conduct of similar trials and to encourage collaborations with other researchers.

23760377	Effects of slow breathing exercise on cardiovascular functions, pulmonary functions & galvanic skin resistance in healthy human volunteers - a pilot study.	BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Regular practice of slow breathing has been shown to improve cardiovascular and respiratory functions and to decrease the effects of stress. This pilot study was planned to evaluate the short term effects of pranayama on cardiovascular functions, pulmonary functions and galvanic skin resistance (GSR) which mirrors sympathetic tone, and to evaluate the changes that appear within a short span of one week following slow breathing techniques. METHODS: Eleven normal healthy volunteers were randomized into Pranayama group (n=6) and a non-Pranayama control group (n=5); the pranayama volunteers were trained in pranayama, the technique being Anuloma-Viloma pranayama with Kumbhak. All the 11 volunteers were made to sit in similar environment for two sessions of 20 min each for seven days, while the pranayama volunteers performed slow breathing under supervision, the control group relaxed without conscious control on breathing. Pulse, GSR, blood pressure (BP) and pulmonary function tests (PFT) were measured before and after the 7-day programme in all the volunteers. RESULTS: While no significant changes were observed in BP and PFT, an overall reduction in pulse rate was observed in all the eleven volunteers; this reduction might have resulted from the relaxation and the environment. Statistically significant changes were observed in the Pranayama group volunteers in the GSR values during standing phases indicating that regular practice of Pranayama causes a reduction in the sympathetic tone within a period as short as 7 days. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Beneficial effects of pranayama started appearing within a week of regular practice, and the first change appeared to be a reduction in sympathetic tone.

23741164	Medical education in India: Time to encourage cross-talk between different streams.	Currently, India recognizes five different healthcare systems, collectively known as AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy), along with the conventional biomedicine. These systems have their own institutionalized structure for monitoring medical education and practice. However, because of the 'parallel' kind of policy model that is followed in India, there is no formal provision for any cross-talk between the professionals belonging to these different streams. This situation has not only given rise to mutual misgivings among these professionals regarding the strengths and weaknesses of each other, but also has led to a poor appreciation of the historical and socio-cultural connections these streams share with the community at large. To tackle these issues and to promote adequate participation of biomedicine experts in AYUSH-related research projects, 'introduction of an AYUSH module in the current curriculum of MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery) program' has been proposed in this communication along with a possible roadmap for its implementation. It is also suggested that the experts in biomedicine be engaged for training AYUSH graduates in their respective specialties so that quality AYUSH education may be ensured.

23741159	Impact of long term Yoga practice on sleep quality and quality of life in the elderly.	BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbances and decline in the physical functionality are common conditions associated with aging. Pharmacological treatment of sleep disturbances can be associated with various adverse effects. Short term trials of Yoga on sleep have shown beneficial effects. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of long-term Yoga exercises on sleep quality and quality of life (QOL) in the elderly. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in which data were collected from elderly people aged 60 years or more living in Nagpur city. We employed two types of survey questionnaires: Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and QOL Leiden-Padua (LEIPAD) Questionnaire. A total of 65 elderly men and women who signed an informed consent and completed questionnaires were included in the study. Sleep quality score PSQI and QOL (LEIPAD Questionnaire) score of the study group were evaluated and compared with the control group using Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Total PSQI score in Yoga group was lower than that of the control group. Also various QOL scores of the Yoga groups were higher than the control group. CONCLUSION: Addition of regular Yoga exercises in the daily routine of elderly people can help to achieve good sleep quality as well as improve the QOL.

23738677	The effect of Bikram yoga on arterial stiffness in young and older adults.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Bikram yoga is the most popular form of hot yoga, despite the limited information available on its cardiovascular benefits. This study sought to determine the effect of Bikram yoga on arterial stiffness and insulin resistance in young and older adults. METHODS: Twenty-four young (mean age+/-standard deviation, 30+/-1 years) and 18 middle-aged and older (mean age, 53+/-2 years) adults completed an 8-week Bikram yoga intervention. Bikram yoga classes were performed for 90 minutes per session, three times per week, in a room heated to 40.5 degrees C with 40%--60% relative humidity. RESULTS: Body mass, body fat percentage, blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose and triglyceride concentrations did not significantly change as a result of the intervention in either the young or the older group. Trunk flexibility, as measured by the sit-and-reach test, increased in both groups (p<0.01). Total (p<0.05) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p<0.05) levels, plasma insulin concentrations (p<0.01), and scores on the homeostatic model of the assessment of insulin resistance (p<0.01) decreased in older adults, whereas total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were reduced in young adults (all p<0.05). Carotid artery compliance (p<0.05) was increased and beta-stiffness index decreased in young (p<0.05) but not in older adults. Carotid pulse pressure did not significantly change in either group. CONCLUSION: A relatively short-term Bikram yoga intervention improved arterial stiffness in young but not older adults and significantly reduced insulin resistance index in older but not young adults.

23734443	Immediate cardiovascular effects of pranava pranayama in hypertensive patients.	Slow, deep, pranayama-based breathing training has been shown to be effective in reducing blood pressure (BP). The present study was undertaken to determine immediate effects of performing pranava pranayama on cardiovascular parameters in hypertensive patients. 29 hypertensive patients who were on medical treatment and also attending yoga sessions were recruited for the present study. Supine heart rate (HR) and BP were recorded before and after performance of pranava pranayama for five minutes. Post intervention statistical analysis revealed a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in systolic pressure (SP) and a more significant (P < 0.01) reduction in HR, pulse pressure and double product (Do P). The reduction in rate-pressure product (RPP) was highly significant (P < 0.001). Pranava pranayama is effective in reducing HR and SP in hypertensive patients within five minutes of the practice. This may be due to a normalization of autonomic cardiovascular rhythms as a result of increased vagal modulation and/or decreased sympathetic activity and improved baroreflex sensitivity along with an augmentation of endogenous nitric oxide production. Our findings have potential therapeutic applications in day-to-day as well as clinical situations where blood pressure needs to be brought down at the earliest. The significant fall in RPP and Do P signifies a reduction in oxygen consumption and work done by the heart. It is concluded that pranava pranayama, a simple and cost effective technique can be used in the management of hypertensive patients in addition to the regular medical management. Further studies are required to enable a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved and its usefulness in the long- term management of hypertension.

23734439	Effect of yoga on different aspects of mental health.	State anxiety, somatization of stress, quality of life, self-rated quality of sleep, and discomfort due to over-breathing which occurs when stressed were studied. Out of a total of 140 participants, seventy participants self-selected to be in a yoga group for stress relief (group mean age +/- SD, 33.0 +/- 6.5 years; 37 males). Seventy age and gender matched participants were in a control group. State anxiety, somatization of stress, quality of life, discomfort and self-rated quality of sleep were assessed using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Symptom Checklist-90-R, SF-12, Nijmegen Discomfort Evaluation Scale and a Sleep Rating Questionnaire respectively. Assessments were made at the beginning and end of the week. Repeated measures ANOVAs with Bonferroni adjusted post-hoc analyses showed a significant decrease in state anxiety (P < 0.001), somatization of stress (P < 0.01), improved health-related quality of life (P < 0.01), self-rated quality of sleep (P < 0.01), and decrease in discomfort due to over-breathing (P < 0.001). No changes (except decreased discomfort due to over-breathing; P < 0.01) occurred in the control group. This study suggests that a brief yoga program may be beneficial in decreasing anxiety, somatization of stress and discomfort, improving health-related quality of life and self-rated sleep quality.

23730050	Innovations in Endosurgery-Journey into the Past of the Future: To Ride the SILS Bandwagon or Not?	Progress in surgical practice has paralleled the civilizational evolution. Surgery has progressed from being the last resort in saving life to being form and function preserver. Post-renaissance Industrial age gave an impetus to this march of surgery. The currently on going digital technological revolution has further catalysed this march. Having achieved the stabilized and acceptable clinical outcomes, the surgeon has embarked on a journey of improving patient reported outcomes (PRO). Improvement in PROs with the advent of laparoscopic surgery with the attendant emphasis on minimising invasion has led to debates about invasion being just parietal or holistic in physiological sense. There is a concern that parietal invasiveness shouldn't be a trade-off for compromised clinical outcomes. Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery (SILS) in its current avatar with current instrumentation seems to be an enthusiastic bandwagon rolling on with the cosmetic benefits acting as veil to hide the potential clinical concerns. History of surgical innovations is riddled with tales of vindictiveness and vicissitude. Lest the same fate befalls SILS we would do better to examine the SILS bandwagon in its current form till the emerging technologies address the current concerns.

23728685	Breathing exercises for dysfunctional breathing/hyperventilation syndrome in adults.	BACKGROUND: Dysfunctional breathing/hyperventilation syndrome (DB/HVS) is a respiratory disorder, psychologically or physiologically based, involving breathing too deeply and/or too rapidly (hyperventilation) or erratic breathing interspersed with breath-holding or sighing (DB). DB/HVS can result in significant patient morbidity and an array of symptoms including breathlessness, chest tightness, dizziness, tremor and paraesthesia. DB/HVS has an estimated prevalence of 9.5% in the general adult population, however, there is little consensus regarding the most effective management of this patient group. OBJECTIVES: (1) To determine whether breathing exercises in patients with DB/HVS have beneficial effects as measured by quality of life indices (2) To determine whether there are any adverse effects of breathing exercises in patients with DB/HVS SEARCH METHODS: We identified trials for consideration using both electronic and manual search strategies. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and four other databases. The latest search was in February 2013. SELECTION CRITERIA: We planned to include randomised, quasi-randomised or cluster randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which breathing exercises, or a combined intervention including breathing exercises as a key component, were compared with either no treatment or another therapy that did not include breathing exercises in patients with DB/HVS. Observational studies, case studies and studies utilising a cross-over design were not eligible for inclusion.We considered any type of breathing exercise for inclusion in this review, such as breathing control, diaphragmatic breathing, yoga breathing, Buteyko breathing, biofeedback-guided breathing modification, yawn/sigh suppression. Programs where exercises were either supervised or unsupervised were eligible as were relaxation techniques and acute-episode management, as long as it was clear that breathing exercises were a key component of the intervention.We excluded any intervention without breathing exercises or where breathing exercises were not key to the intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently checked search results for eligible studies, assessed all studies that appeared to meet the selection criteria and extracted data. We used standard procedures recommended by The Cochrane Collaboration. MAIN RESULTS: We included a single RCT assessed at unclear risk of bias, which compared relaxation therapy (n = 15) versus relaxation therapy and breathing exercises (n = 15) and a no therapy control group (n = 15).Quality of life was not an outcome measure in this RCT, and no numerical data or statistical analysis were presented in this paper. A significant reduction in the frequency and severity of hyperventilation attacks in the breathing exercise group compared with the control group was reported. In addition, a significant difference in frequency and severity of hyperventilation attacks between the breathing and relaxation group was reported. However, no information could be extracted from the paper regarding the size of the treatment effects. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The results of this systematic review are unable to inform clinical practice, based on the inclusion of only one small, poorly reported RCT. There is no credible evidence regarding the effectiveness of breathing exercises for the clinical symptoms of DB/HVS. It is currently unknown whether these interventions offer any added value in this patient group or whether specific types of breathing exercise demonstrate superiority over others. Given that breathing exercises are frequently used to treat DB/HVS, there is an urgent need for further well designed clinical trials in this area. Future trials should conform to the CONSORT statement for standards of reporting and use appropriate, validated outcome measures. Trial reports should also ensure full disclosure of data for all important clinical outcomes.	Jones, Mandy;Harvey, Alex;Marston, Louise;O'Connell, Neil E	2013 May 31
23723673	A clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of Trataka Yoga Kriya and eye exercises (non-pharmocological methods) in the management of Timira (Ammetropia and Presbyopia).	Timira is a disease that can be attributed to wide range of clinical conditions starting from mild blurring of vision and having potential risk of permanent vision loss. According to the involvement of Dhatus (body elements) the condition can be grouped into two stages. The initial stage or Uttana, where the involvement of Dhatus is limited to Rasa, Rakta (blood), and Mamsa Dhatu (muscle tissue). When the Doshas are localized in the first and second Patala refractive error do happen and in presbyopia more emphasis is given to Mamsa Dhatu. In this study only Uttana stage of Timira was considered. The clinical study was done on 66 patients of Timira in two groups of four sub groups each of myopia, hypermetropia, astigmatism, and presbyopia. Group A was subjected to eye exercises (Bates method) and Group B was subjected to Trataka Yoga Kriya. After the enrolment of patients for this study, signs and symptoms were assessed both subjectively and objectively before, during, and after treatment. The study indicates that subjectively there are significant results in both the groups but objectively there is not much improvement.	Gopinathan, G;Dhiman, Kartar Singh;Manjusha, R	2012 Oct
23721984	Lifestyle Modification in Blood Pressure Study II (LIMBS): study protocol of a randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of a 24 week structured yoga program versus lifestyle modification on blood pressure reduction.	Hypertension is a major public health issue affecting 68 million adults in the United States. Lifestyle modifications including complementary therapies such as the movement based mind body practice of yoga have become increasingly popular in the United States and have been considered as a potential alternative to medication in blood pressure reduction. We completed a pilot study in 2009 which showed meaningful decreases in 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure readings after a 12 week period of yoga participation. Based on data from our pilot study we are now completing The Lifestyle Modification and Blood Pressure Study (LIMBS II) which is a phase 2 randomized controlled trial designed to determine the effects of yoga therapy and enhanced lifestyle modification on lowering blood pressure in pre-hypertensive and stage 1 hypertensive subjects. Using 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, LIMBS II aims to compare the effects on blood pressure reduction in subjects randomized for 24 weeks to one of the three following groups: yoga therapy versus blood pressure education program (sodium restriction and walking program) versus a combination program that involves components of both groups. LIMBS II will also examine the impact that changes in blood pressure have on cerebral blood flow. If successful, the LIMBS study will determine if yoga therapy combined with enhanced lifestyle modification will result in clinically meaningful decreases in blood pressure and thus can be implemented as an alternative to drug therapy for patients with prehypertension and stage 1 hypertension.

23721252	Changes in P300 following alternate nostril yoga breathing and breath awareness.	This study assessed the effect of alternate nostril yoga breathing (nadisuddhi pranayama) on P300 auditory evoked potentials compared to a session of breath awareness of equal duration, in 20 male adult volunteers who had an experience of yoga breathing practices for more than three months. Peak amplitudes and peak latencies of the P300 were assessed before and after the respective sessions. There was a significant increase in the P300 peak amplitudes at Fz, Cz, and Pz and a significant decrease in the peak latency at Fz alone following alternate nostril yoga breathing. Following breath awareness there was a significant increase in the peak amplitude of P300 at Cz. This suggests that alternate nostril yoga breathing positively influences cognitive processes which are required for sustained attention at different scalp sites (frontal, vertex and parietal), whereas breath awareness brings about changes at the vertex alone.

23719569	Cognitive and emotional control of pain and its disruption in chronic pain.	Chronic pain is one of the most prevalent health problems in our modern world, with millions of people debilitated by conditions such as back pain, headache and arthritis. To address this growing problem, many people are turning to mind-body therapies, including meditation, yoga and cognitive behavioural therapy. This article will review the neural mechanisms underlying the modulation of pain by cognitive and emotional states - important components of mind-body therapies. It will also examine the accumulating evidence that chronic pain itself alters brain circuitry, including that involved in endogenous pain control, suggesting that controlling pain becomes increasingly difficult as pain becomes chronic.

23717763	Effects of hata yoga on knee osteoarthritis.	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this research was to study the effects of 8 weeks of Hata yoga exercises on women with knee osteoarthritis. Studies about effects of Yoga on different chronic diseases show that these exercises have positive effects on chronic diseases. As knee osteoarthritis is very common among middle age women we decided to measure effectiveness of these exercises on knee osteoarthritis. METHODS: Sample included 30 women with knee osteoarthritis who voluntarily participated in this semi-experimental study and were divided into a control group (15) and a yoga group (15). The yoga group received 60 minutes sessions of Hata yoga, 3 times a week and for 8 weeks. Pain, symptoms, daily activities, sports and spare-time activities, and quality of life were respectively measured by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scale (KOOS) questionnaire. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) method for repetitive data was used to analyze the results (P = 0.05). RESULTS: Findings showed that pain and symptoms were significantly decreased and scores of daily activities, sports, spare-time activities, and quality of life were significantly increased in the yoga group. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that yoga can be used as a conservative treatment besides usual treatments and medications to improve the condition of people with osteoarthritis.

23716803	Integrative medicine selects best practice from public health and biomedicine.	The meaning of terms Integrated and Integrative are described variously by an amalgam of latest scientific advances with ancient healing systems, of complementary medicine and biomedicine, and sexually transmitted infections and HIV/AIDS. It means seamless good quality care between hospital and primary care. They provoke approval mostly from patients and disapproval mostly from advocates of science and evidence-based medicine. The Institute of Applied Dermatology in Kasaragod, Kerala, India has championed a mix of Biomedicine, Yoga and herbals from Ayurvedic medicine, partly based on publications from the Department of Dermatology of the University of Oxford. In Oxford dermatology, acceptance of value of integrative medicine (IM) is demonstrated, especially in wound healing and the skin's blood supply. This has long featured in the university's research program. A variety of approaches to the practice of medicine are illustrated with reference to Osler, Garrod, and Doll. IM is believed to underlie contemporarily best practice. Particular emphasis is given to the control of heat, pain, redness, and swelling, all manifestations of inflammation, and the importance of emotion as a stimulus or inhibitor carried by neural pathways. These may explain some unbelievable Asian practices and one of the many roles of Yoga. The concept of Integrative is expanded to include care of the earth and nutrition, the hazards of climate change, Gardens for Health, do (k) no (w) harm as a key to good practice.

23715475	Yoga effects on mood and quality of life in Chinese women undergoing heroin detoxification: a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Yoga, as a mind-body therapy, is effective in improving quality of life for patients with chronic diseases, yet little is known about its effectiveness in female heroin addicts. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of yoga on mood status and quality of life among women undergoing detoxification for heroin dependence in China. METHOD: This study was a randomized controlled trial. Seventy-five women aged 20-37 years undergoing detoxification for heroin dependence at AnKang Hospital were allocated randomly into an intervention or a control group. Women in the intervention group received a 6-month yoga intervention in addition to hospital routine care, and women in the control group received hospital routine care only. Mood status and quality of life were assessed using the Profile of Mood States and Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form Health Survey at baseline and following 3 and 6 months of treatment. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to evaluate treatment and time effects on mood and quality of life. RESULTS: Most female heroin addicts were young and single, with a low education level. Most had used heroin by injection. Mood state and quality of life of female heroin addicts were poor. The intervention group showed a significant improvement in mood status and quality of life over time compared with their counterparts in the control group. CONCLUSION: Yoga may improve mood status and quality of life for women undergoing detoxification for heroin dependence. Yoga can be used as an auxiliary treatment with traditional hospital routine care for these women.	Zhuang, Shu-mei;An, Shi-hui;Zhao, Yue	2013 Jul-Aug

23710236	Cardiovascular and respiratory effect of yogic slow breathing in the yoga beginner: what is the best approach?	Slow breathing increases cardiac-vagal baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), improves oxygen saturation, lowers blood pressure, and reduces anxiety. Within the yoga tradition slow breathing is often paired with a contraction of the glottis muscles. This resistance breath "ujjayi" is performed at various rates and ratios of inspiration/expiration. To test whether ujjayi had additional positive effects to slow breathing, we compared BRS and ventilatory control under different breathing patterns (equal/unequal inspiration/expiration at 6 breath/min, with/without ujjayi), in 17 yoga-naive young healthy participants. BRS increased with slow breathing techniques with or without expiratory ujjayi (P < 0.05 or higher) except with inspiratory + expiratory ujjayi. The maximal increase in BRS and decrease in blood pressure were found in slow breathing with equal inspiration and expiration. This corresponded with a significant improvement in oxygen saturation without increase in heart rate and ventilation. Ujjayi showed similar increase in oxygen saturation but slightly lesser improvement in baroreflex sensitivity with no change in blood pressure. The slow breathing with equal inspiration and expiration seems the best technique for improving baroreflex sensitivity in yoga-naive subjects. The effects of ujjayi seems dependent on increased intrathoracic pressure that requires greater effort than normal slow breathing.

23709458	Narrative review of yoga intervention clinical trials including weight-related outcomes.	CONTEXT: Medical authorities have identified obesity as a causal factor in the development of diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), and more broadly, of metabolic syndrome/insulin resistance syndrome. To provide solutions that can modify this risk factor, researchers need to identify methods of effective risk reduction and primary prevention of obesity. Research on the effectiveness of yoga as a treatment for obesity is limited, and studies vary in overall quality and methodological rigor. OBJECTIVE: This narrative review assessed the quantity and quality of clinical trials of yoga as an intervention for weight loss or as a means of risk reduction or treatment for obesity and diseases in which obesity is a causal factor. This review summarized the studies' research designs and evaluated the efficacy of yoga for weight loss via the current evidence base. DESIGN: The research team evaluated published studies to determine the appropriateness of research designs, comparability of programs' intervention elements, and standardization of outcome measures. The research team's literature search used the key terms yoga and obesity or yoga and weight loss in three primary medical-literature databases (PubMed, PsychInfo, and Web of Science). The study excluded clinical trials with no quantitative obesity related measure. Extracted data included each study's (1) design; (2) setting and population; (3) nature, duration, and frequency of interventions; (4) comparison groups; (5) recruitment strategies; (6) outcome measures; (7) data analysis and presentation; and (8) results and conclusions. The research team developed an overall evaluation parameter to compare disparate trials. OUTCOME MEASURES: The research team reviewed each study to determine its key features, each worth a specified number of points, with a maximum total of 20 points. The features included a study's (1) duration, (2) frequency of yoga practice, (3) intensity of (length of) each practice, (4) number of yogic elements, (5) inclusion of dietary modification, (6) inclusion of a residential component, (7) the number of weight-related outcome measures, and (8) a discussion of the details of the yogic elements. RESULTS: Overall, therapeutic yoga programs are frequently effective in promoting weight loss and/or improvements in body composition. The effectiveness of yoga for weight loss is related to the following key features: (1) an increased frequency of practice; (2) a longer intervention duration (3) a yogic dietary component; (4) a residential component; (5) the comprehensive inclusion of yogic components; (5) and a home-practice component. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga appears to be an appropriate and potentially successful intervention for weight maintenance, prevention of obesity, and risk reduction for diseases in which obesity plays a significant causal role.

23706890	Feasibility, acceptability, and effects of gentle Hatha yoga for women with major depression: findings from a randomized controlled mixed-methods study.	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, debilitating chronic condition in the United States and worldwide. Particularly in women, depressive symptoms are often accompanied by high levels of stress and ruminations, or repetitive self-critical negative thinking. There is a research and clinical imperative to evaluate complementary therapies that are acceptable and feasible for women with depression and that target specific aspects of depression in women, such as ruminations. To begin to address this need, we conducted a randomized, controlled, mixed-methods community-based study comparing an 8-week yoga intervention with an attention-control activity in 27 women with MDD. After controlling for baseline stress, there was a decrease in depression over time in both the yoga group and the attention-control group, with the yoga group having a unique trend in decreased ruminations. Participants in the yoga group reported experiencing increased connectedness and gaining a coping strategy through yoga. The findings provide support for future large scale research to explore the effects of yoga for depressed women and the unique role of yoga in decreasing rumination.

23701973	Comparative effectiveness of a complex Ayurvedic treatment and conventional standard care in osteoarthritis of the knee--study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Traditional Indian Ayurvedic medicine uses complex treatment approaches, including manual therapies, lifestyle and nutritional advice, dietary supplements, medication, yoga, and purification techniques. Ayurvedic strategies are often used to treat osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee; however, no systematic data are available on their effectiveness in comparison with standard care. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of complex Ayurvedic treatment in comparison with conventional methods of treating OA symptoms in patients with knee osteoarthritis. METHODS AND DESIGN: In a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial, 150 patients between 40 and 70 years, diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the knee, following American College of Rheumatology criteria and an average pain intensity of >/=40 mm on a 100 mm visual analog scale in the affected knee at baseline will be randomized into two groups. In the Ayurveda group, treatment will include tailored combinations of manual treatments, massages, dietary and lifestyle advice, consideration of selected foods, nutritional supplements, yoga posture advice, and knee massage. Patients in the conventional group will receive self-care advice, pain medication, weight-loss advice (if overweight), and physiotherapy following current international guidelines. Both groups will receive 15 treatment sessions over 12 weeks. Outcomes will be evaluated after 6 and 12 weeks and 6 and 12 months. The primary endpoint is a change in the score on the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) after 12 weeks. Secondary outcome measurements will use WOMAC subscales, a pain disability index, a visual analog scale for pain and sleep quality, a pain experience scale, a quality-of-life index, a profile of mood states, and Likert scales for patient satisfaction, patient diaries, and safety. Using an adapted PRECIS scale, the trial was identified as lying mainly in the middle of the efficacy-effectiveness continuum. DISCUSSION: This trial is the first to compare the effectiveness of a complex Ayurvedic intervention with a complex conventional intervention in a Western medical setting in patients with knee osteoarthritis. During the trial design, aspects of efficacy and effectiveness were discussed. The resulting design is a compromise between rigor and pragmatism. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01225133.

23700366	Mood disorders and complementary and alternative medicine: a literature review.	Mood disorders are a major public health problem and are associated with considerable burden of disease, suicides, physical comorbidities, high economic costs, and poor quality of life. Approximately 30%-40% of patients with major depression have only a partial response to available pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been used either alone or in combination with conventional therapies in patients with mood disorders. This review of the literature examines evidence-based data on the use of CAM in mood disorders. A search of the PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, and Quertile databases using keywords was conducted, and relevant articles published in the English language in the peer-reviewed journals over the past two decades were retrieved. Evidence-based data suggest that light therapy, St John's wort, Rhodiola rosea, omega-3 fatty acids, yoga, acupuncture, mindfulness therapies, exercise, sleep deprivation, and S-adenosylmethionine are effective in the treatment of mood disorders. Clinical trials of vitamin B complex, vitamin D, and methylfolate found that, while these were useful in physical illness, results were equivocal in patients with mood disorders. Studies support the adjunctive role of omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid in unipolar and bipolar depression, although manic symptoms are not affected and higher doses are required in patients with resistant bipolar depression and rapid cycling. Omega-3 fatty acids are useful in pregnant women with major depression, and have no adverse effects on the fetus. Choline, inositol, 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan, and N-acetylcysteine are effective adjuncts in bipolar patients. Dehydroepiandrosterone is effective both in bipolar depression and depression in the setting of comorbid physical disease, although doses should be titrated to avoid adverse effects. Ayurvedic and homeopathic therapies have the potential to improve symptoms of depression, although larger controlled trials are needed. Mind-body-spirit and integrative medicine approaches can be used effectively in mild to moderate depression and in treatment-resistant depression. Currently, although CAM therapies are not the primary treatment of mood disorders, level 1 evidence could emerge in the future showing that such treatments are effective.

23696275	Insular cortex mediates increased pain tolerance in yoga practitioners.	Yoga, an increasingly popular discipline among Westerners, is frequently used to improve painful conditions. We investigated possible neuroanatomical underpinnings of the beneficial effects of yoga using sensory testing and magnetic resonance imaging techniques. North American yogis tolerated pain more than twice as long as individually matched controls and had more gray matter (GM) in multiple brain regions. Across subjects, insular GM uniquely correlated with pain tolerance. Insular GM volume in yogis positively correlated with yoga experience, suggesting a causal relationship between yoga and insular size. Yogis also had increased left intrainsular white matter integrity, consistent with a strengthened insular integration of nociceptive input and parasympathetic autonomic regulation. Yogis, as opposed to controls, used cognitive strategies involving parasympathetic activation and interoceptive awareness to tolerate pain, which could have led to use-dependent hypertrophy of insular cortex. Together, these findings suggest that regular and long-term yoga practice improves pain tolerance in typical North Americans by teaching different ways to deal with sensory inputs and the potential emotional reactions attached to those inputs leading to a change in insular brain anatomy and connectivity.

23690846	A yoga and compassion meditation program reduces stress in familial caregivers of Alzheimer's disease patients.	Familial caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease exhibit reduced quality of life and increased stress levels. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of an 8-week yoga and compassion meditation program on the perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and salivary cortisol levels in familial caregivers. A total of 46 volunteers were randomly assigned to participate in a stress-reduction program for a 2-month period (yoga and compassion meditation program-YCMP group) (n = 25) or an untreated group for the same period of time (control group) (n = 21). The levels of stress, anxiety, depression, and morning salivary cortisol of the participants were measured before and after intervention. The groups were initially homogeneous; however, after intervention, the groups diverged significantly. The YCMP group exhibited a reduction of the stress (P < 0.05), anxiety (P < 0.000001), and depression (P < 0.00001) levels, as well as a reduction in the concentration of salivary cortisol (P < 0.05). Our study suggests that an 8-week yoga and compassion meditation program may offer an effective intervention for reducing perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and salivary cortisol in familial caregivers.

23690832	Mediators of yoga and stretching for chronic low back pain.	Although yoga is an effective treatment for chronic low back pain, little is known about the mechanisms responsible for its benefits. In a trial comparing yoga to intensive stretching and self-care, we explored whether physical (hours of back exercise/week), cognitive (fear avoidance, body awareness, and self-efficacy), affective (psychological distress, perceived stress, positive states of mind, and sleep), and physiological factors (cortisol, DHEA) mediated the effects of yoga or stretching on back-related dysfunction (Roland-Morris Disability Scale (RDQ)). For yoga, 36% of the effect on 12-week RDQ was mediated by increased self-efficacy, 18% by sleep disturbance, 9% by hours of back exercise, and 61% by the best combination of all possible mediators (6 mediators). For stretching, 23% of the effect was mediated by increased self-efficacy, 14% by days of back exercise, and 50% by the best combination of all possible mediators (7 mediators). In open-ended questions, >/=20% of participants noted the following treatment benefits: learning new exercises (both groups), relaxation, increased awareness, and the benefits of breathing (yoga), benefits of regular practice (stretching). Although both self-efficacy and hours of back exercise were the strongest mediators for each intervention, compared to self-care, qualitative data suggest that they may exert their benefits through partially distinct mechanisms.

23686463	The feasibility of a holistic wellness program for HIV/AIDS patients residing in a voluntary inpatient treatment program.	The purpose of this project was to examine the feasibility of an ongoing holistic wellness program in a residential facility treating persons with HIV/AIDS. The goal was to create a voluntary, four week holistic wellness intensive within the established inpatient behavioral health treatment program. Participants were given practicable holistic self care tools to effectively manage HIV related symptoms, general medical issues, addiction, depression, stress and anxiety. The program incorporated evidence-based holistic activities including yoga, therapeutic dance, meditation, Reiki, and reflective journaling. Narrative survey results and post-program evaluation support that an ongoing holistic wellness program within the existing treatment model is feasible and could have numerous potential beneficial effects. This project clearly exemplified the ideal opportunity for holistic nurses to implement innovative holistic interventions within the current healthcare delivery system. It is the author's observation that future studies with a larger participant group to further examine measurable benefits can lend valuable information and insight into the future development of holistic wellness programs for residential treatment facilities.

23681684	Integrative medicine at academic health centers: a survey of clinicians' educational backgrounds and practices.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Integrative medicine is a relatively new field that seeks to combine conventional and nonconventional approaches to patient care. Many academic health centers have now established integrative medicine clinics, yet little is known about the clinicians who practice at them. We used a nationwide survey to characterize the backgrounds, clinical practices, and involvement in research and education of clinicians who practice integrative medicine at academic health centers. METHODS: Participants included clinicians (MDs, DOs, PAs, and nurse practitioners) who practice at 30 different integrative medicine clinics that are affiliated with academic health centers. RESULTS: Completed surveys from 136 of 162 clinicians were received (84% response rate). The integrative therapies that clinicians most often reported providing themselves were breathing exercises (66%), herbal medicine prescribing (61%), meditation (44%), and functional medicine (34%). The integrative therapies that clinicians most often referred their patients for were acupuncture (96%), massage (92%), yoga (85%), and meditation (79%). Respondents reported spending a mean of 20% of their time training medical students, and 63% had participated in research in the past year. CONCLUSIONS: This survey provides the first national assessment of clinicians practicing integrative medicine at academic health centers. These clinicians use a wide variety of complementary and alternative therapies and appear involved in the research and education missions of their academic health centers.

23664122	Mind-body practices: an alternative, drug-free treatment for smoking cessation? A systematic review of the literature.	OBJECTIVE: The limited success of current smoking cessation therapies encourages research into new treatment strategies. Mind-body practices such as yoga and meditation have the potential to aid smoking cessation and become an alternative drug-free treatment option. The aim of this article is to assess the efficacy of yoga and other meditation-based interventions for smoking cessation, to identify the challenges of clinical trials applying mind-body treatments, and to outline directions for future research on these types of therapies to assist in smoking cessation. METHODS: A systematic review of the scientific literature. RESULTS: Fourteen clinical trials met the inclusion criteria defined for this review. Each article was reviewed thoroughly, and evaluated for quality, design, and methodology. Although primary outcomes differed between studies, the fourteen articles, most with limitations, reported promising effects supporting further investigation of the use of these practices to improve smoking cessation. CONCLUSIONS: The literature supports yoga and meditation-based therapies as candidates to assist smoking cessation. However, the small number of studies available and associated methodological problems require more clinical trials with larger sample sizes and carefully monitored interventions to determine rigorously if yoga and meditation are effective treatments.

23663078	Predictors of adherence to a 26-week viniyoga intervention among post-treatment breast cancer survivors.	OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify demographic, psychological, health-related, and geographic predictors of adherence to home-based and supervised components of a yoga intervention in breast cancer survivors. METHODS: Participants were the 32 post-treatment breast cancer survivors who were randomized to the Viniyoga intervention arm of a controlled trial. Participants were asked to practice yoga 5 times per week for 6 months, including at least one weekly facility-based session. Adherence was monitored using sign-in sheets and logs. Height and weight were measured; other potential predictors of adherence were obtained from baseline questionnaires. RESULTS: Participants attended 19.6+/-13.0 yoga classes and performed 55.8+/-32.8 home-based yoga sessions. Participants adhered to 58% of the overall yoga practice goal (75% of the goal for yoga classes and 54% of the goal for home based-sessions). Higher class attendance and home practice were predicted by greater self-efficacy for yoga (p=0.004 and 0.06, respectively). Additionally, employment outside the home was associated with greater class attendance (p=0.004), while higher waist circumference was marginally associated with lower adherence to home-based yoga (p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: High levels of facility- and home-based yoga practice were achieved. Breast cancer survivors who have lower self-efficacy for yoga or who have a higher waist circumference may benefit from additional support or intervention tailoring. Adherence may also be improved by ensuring that class times are convenient to both working and nonworking women.

23662111	Control group design: enhancing rigor in research of mind-body therapies for depression.	Although a growing body of research suggests that mind-body therapies may be appropriate to integrate into the treatment of depression, studies consistently lack methodological sophistication particularly in the area of control groups. In order to better understand the relationship between control group selection and methodological rigor, we provide a brief review of the literature on control group design in yoga and tai chi studies for depression, and we discuss challenges we have faced in the design of control groups for our recent clinical trials of these mind-body complementary therapies for women with depression. To address the multiple challenges of research about mind-body therapies, we suggest that researchers should consider 4 key questions: whether the study design matches the research question; whether the control group addresses performance, expectation, and detection bias; whether the control group is ethical, feasible, and attractive; and whether the control group is designed to adequately control for nonspecific intervention effects. Based on these questions, we provide specific recommendations about control group design with the goal of minimizing bias and maximizing validity in future research.

23658936		OBJECTIVES: To assess efficacy, comparative effectiveness, and harms of psychological, pharmacological, and emerging interventions to prevent posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults. DATA SOURCES: PubMed((R)), the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Embase, PILOTS, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, PsycINFO((R)), Web of Science, reference lists of published literature (from January 1, 1980, to July 30, 2012). In addition, we searched various sources for grey literature. REVIEW METHODS: Two investigators independently selected, extracted data from, and rated risk of bias of relevant studies. If data were sufficient, we conducted quantitative analyses using random-effects models to estimate pooled effects. We graded strength of evidence (SOE) based on established guidance. RESULTS: We included 19 trials with a range of populations exposed to a variety of psychological traumas. Participants suffered from symptoms of PTSD but did not meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD. For most interventions studied, we did not find reliable evidence to support efficacy for the prevention of PTSD or for the reduction of PTSD-related symptom severity. Evidence was sufficient to justify conclusions about three treatments. First, debriefing does not reduce either the incidence or the severity of PTSD or related psychological symptoms in civilian victims of crime, assault, or accident trauma (low SOE). Second, our meta-analyses of three trials showed that, in subjects with acute stress disorder, brief trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was more effective than supportive counseling (SC) in reducing the severity of PTSD (moderate SOE). Pooled results did not reach statistical significance for incidence of PTSD, depression symptom severity (both low SOE), and anxiety symptom severity (moderate SOE), but numerically favored CBT over SC. Finally, collaborative care for a traumatic injury requiring hospitalization produces a greater decrease in PTSD symptom severity at 6, 9, and 12 months after injury than does usual care (low SOE). The efficacy of psychological interventions to prevent PTSD did not differ between men and women (low SOE). Evidence was insufficient to determine whether previous depression or a history of child abuse or baseline PTSD symptoms influence the effectiveness of interventions. Evidence was insufficient to determine the effect of timing, intensity, or dosing on the effectiveness or risk of harms of interventions or to justify conclusions about the comparative risk of harms. For emerging interventions such as yoga, dietary supplements, and complementary or alternative interventions, no studies met our eligibility criteria. Evidence was insufficient to determine whether any treatment approaches were more effective for victims of particular trauma types. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence supporting the effectiveness of most interventions used to prevent PTSD is lacking. If available in a given setting, brief trauma-focused CBT might be the preferable choice for reducing PTSD symptom severity in persons with acute stress disorder and collaborative care might be preferred for trauma patients requiring surgical hospitalization; by contrast, debriefing appears to be an ineffective intervention to reduce symptoms and prevent PTSD.

23652636	Is yoga an effective treatment in the management of patients with chronic low back pain compared with other care modalities - a systematic review.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess randomized-control trials (RCTs) to ascertain whether yoga is an effective treatment in the management of patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP) compared with other care modalities. METHODS: A search strategy was formulated with key concepts identified using the PICO process. Four databases were searched in June 2012. Appropriate eligibility criteria were set and implemented. RESULTS: Four randomized control trials met the inclusion criteria. All four papers found that yoga lead to a significant improvement in back function, and three demonstrated a significant improvement in back pain when compared with certain care modalities. All papers had significant limitations identified, however. CONCLUSIONS: Given the limitations identified within the studies, the conclusions drawn must be considered conservatively. Although early results appear promising, but further well-designed RCTs are warranted, with multiple, specified comparator care modalities before firm conclusions can be gained.

23651041	Fatigue related to radiotherapy for breast and/or gynaecological cancer: a systematic review.	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To assess the profile, evaluation criteria and fatigue treatment. BACKGROUND: Fatigue, characterised by tiredness, weakness or lack of energy, involves physical, cognitive and emotional aspects. Its aetiology is not well defined and the prevalence ranges from 30-70% in women with breast cancer, reaching up to 80% when they are undergoing radiotherapy. This is one of the most frequent side effects of radiotherapy, and it may interfere with self-esteem, social activities and quality of life. DESIGN: Literature systematic review. METHODS: A search for studies published from 2000-2010 was carried out in Pubmed, Scielo and Bireme databases, using the descriptors fatigue and radiotherapy and their correlates in Portuguese. RESULTS: We selected 12 articles of 1085 found. The number of studies involving breast cancer was higher than those related to gynaecological cancer. Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Fatigue was the most used scale specifically for the evaluation of fatigue. Pretreatment fatigue level may be an important risk factor to aggravate it during radiotherapy and decrease the quality of life. Five studies proposed interventions, all of them involving nonpharmacological therapies: cognitive-behavioural therapy associated with hypnosis, moderate-intensity physical exercises, stretching programmes, yoga and polarity therapy. The studies showed good results in relation to fatigue, physical and psychological aspects, and quality of life. CONCLUSION: Early detection of fatigue, using appropriate scales, is relevant to propose suitable treatments and achieve better clinical conditions, adherence and continuity of radiotherapy treatment, aiming to ensure more effective responses. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Fatigue is a frequent symptom in patients undergoing radiotherapy. It may become a factor that limits or prevents the continuity of radiotherapy and therefore should be diagnosed in the initial appointments, so that it can be properly treated.

23650531	Relaxation response induces temporal transcriptome changes in energy metabolism, insulin secretion and inflammatory pathways.	The relaxation response (RR) is the counterpart of the stress response. Millennia-old practices evoking the RR include meditation, yoga and repetitive prayer. Although RR elicitation is an effective therapeutic intervention that counteracts the adverse clinical effects of stress in disorders including hypertension, anxiety, insomnia and aging, the underlying molecular mechanisms that explain these clinical benefits remain undetermined. To assess rapid time-dependent (temporal) genomic changes during one session of RR practice among healthy practitioners with years of RR practice and also in novices before and after 8 weeks of RR training, we measured the transcriptome in peripheral blood prior to, immediately after, and 15 minutes after listening to an RR-eliciting or a health education CD. Both short-term and long-term practitioners evoked significant temporal gene expression changes with greater significance in the latter as compared to novices. RR practice enhanced expression of genes associated with energy metabolism, mitochondrial function, insulin secretion and telomere maintenance, and reduced expression of genes linked to inflammatory response and stress-related pathways. Interactive network analyses of RR-affected pathways identified mitochondrial ATP synthase and insulin (INS) as top upregulated critical molecules (focus hubs) and NF-kappaB pathway genes as top downregulated focus hubs. Our results for the first time indicate that RR elicitation, particularly after long-term practice, may evoke its downstream health benefits by improving mitochondrial energy production and utilization and thus promoting mitochondrial resiliency through upregulation of ATPase and insulin function. Mitochondrial resiliency might also be promoted by RR-induced downregulation of NF-kappaB-associated upstream and downstream targets that mitigates stress.

23647889	Effects of a yoga intervention on lipid profiles of diabetes patients with dyslipidemia.	OBJECTIVE: The present study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of yoga in the management of dyslipidemia in patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: This randomized parallel study was carried out in Medical College Trivandrum, Kerala, India. Hundred type 2 diabetics with dyslipidemia were randomized into control and yoga groups. The control group was prescribed oral hypoglycemic drugs. The yoga group practiced yoga daily for 1 h duration along with oral hypoglycemic drugs for 3 months. The lipid profiles of both the groups were compared at the start and at the end of 3 months. RESULTS: After intervention with yoga for a period of 3 months the study group showed a decrease in total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL, with an improvement in HDL. CONCLUSION: Yoga, being a lifestyle incorporating exercise and stress management training, targets the elevated lipid levels in patients with diabetes through integrated approaches.

23647406	Impact of Yoga Nidra on menstrual abnormalities in females of reproductive age.	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to observe the effect of Yoga Nidra practice on hormone levels in patients who had menstrual irregularities. DESIGN: The study was a randomized controlled trial. SETTINGS/LOCATION: The study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Chhatrapati Sahuji Maharaj Medical University, Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow, India. SUBJECTS were divided randomly into 2 groups-an intervention and a control group, with 75 subjects in each group. Of these subjects, 126 completed the study protocol. SUBJECTS: This study involved 150 subjects with menstrual irregularities; 126 of whom completed the protocol. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention was the practice of Yoga Nidra. The yogic intervention duration was 35-40 minutes/day, five times/week for 6 months. An estimation of hormonal profile was done for both groups at baseline and after 6 months. RESULTS: Thyroid-stimulating hormone (p<0.002), follicle-stimulating hormone (p<0.02), luteinizing hormone (p<0.001), and prolactin (p<0.02) were decreased significantly in the intervention group, compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated the efficacy of Yoga Nidra on hormone profiles in patients with menstrual irregularities. Yoga Nidra practice was helpful in patients with hormone imbalances, such as dysmenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, and hypomenorrhea.

23643372	Qualitative evaluation of a high school yoga program: feasibility and perceived benefits.	This is the first published qualitative assessment of a yoga program applied in a high school setting. This qualitative interview study was nested in a randomized, controlled trial studying the effects of a yoga program offered in place of a semester of physical education classes at a rural public high school. Student interviews were conducted after taking part in a semester of the yoga program. A formal passive consent with information about the qualitative study was sent home to parents/guardians of all students in the parent study before the interviews. Most students enjoyed the yoga classes and felt benefits. Negative reports of yoga practice were associated with gender as most males sensed peer pressure against practicing yoga. Despite this finding, most students wanted to continue yoga and would continue if it were offered in school. Positive reports include a greater kinesthetic awareness, which some students associated with a greater respect for the body and improved self-image. Among students reporting psychological benefits, many cited stress reduction; many used yoga to manage negative emotions; and some propagated more optimism. Most thought yoga could reduce interest in the use of drugs and alcohol and increase social cohesion with family and peers. We found that a yoga program is feasible in this sample of 9th and 10th graders, especially after benefits are perceived. We also found evidence that yoga may lead to emergent positive benefits in health behaviors not directly prescribed by the program. These results suggest that school-based yoga programs may be appropriate for promoting healthy behaviors at a societal level by focusing on the prevention of negative patterns during the adolescent transition.

23643369	Qigong as a novel intervention for service members with mild traumatic brain injury.	PURPOSE: To describe the experience of internal qigong practice in service members diagnosed with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK: The study used qualitative descriptive phenomenological methods originally described by Husserl and later refined by Giorgi. METHODOLOGY: Participants were interviewed about their experiences while learning qigong to determine their level of interest, benefits, and/or adverse effects; ease of learning/performing the routine; and any barriers to practice. SAMPLE: Six service members with mTBI receiving outpatient neurorehabilitation at the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center-Charlottesville Rehabilitation Center. INTERVENTION: Participants learned Reflective Exercise Qigong, a form of qigong developed specifically to require less complex movement and balance than most forms of qigong, making it ideal for those with potential coordination and balance issues. DATA COLLECTION: Semistructured interviews took place after four weeks of formal qigong instruction, then again after the subjects completed eight weeks. Interview data were analyzed with phenomenological methods described by Giorgi. RESULTS: Four themes emerged from the interview data: "the physical experience of qigong," "regaining control," "no pain, a lot of gain," and "barriers to qigong practice." Participants offered examples of how qigong enabled them to control refractory symptoms after mTBI while decreasing reliance on pharmacotherapy. All agreed that qigong was uniquely conducive to the disciplined mindset of military service members and that the simplicity of Reflective Exercise qigong, compared with similar modalities such as tai chi and yoga, was well suited to individuals with decreased balance, cognition, and memory related to mTBI.

23642957	A narrative review of yoga and mindfulness as complementary therapies for addiction.	This paper reviews the philosophical origins, current scientific evidence, and clinical promise of yoga and mindfulness as complementary therapies for addiction. Historically, there are eight elements of yoga that, together, comprise ethical principles and practices for living a meaningful, purposeful, moral and self-disciplined life. Traditional yoga practices, including postures and meditation, direct attention toward one's health, while acknowledging the spiritual aspects of one's nature. Mindfulness derives from ancient Buddhist philosophy, and mindfulness meditation practices, such as gentle Hatha yoga and mindful breathing, are increasingly integrated into secular health care settings. Current theoretical models suggest that the skills, insights, and self-awareness learned through yoga and mindfulness practice can target multiple psychological, neural, physiological, and behavioral processes implicated in addiction and relapse. A small but growing number of well-designed clinical trials and experimental laboratory studies on smoking, alcohol dependence, and illicit substance use support the clinical effectiveness and hypothesized mechanisms of action underlying mindfulness-based interventions for treating addiction. Because very few studies have been conducted on the specific role of yoga in treating or preventing addiction, we propose a conceptual model to inform future studies on outcomes and possible mechanisms. Additional research is also needed to better understand what types of yoga and mindfulness-based interventions work best for what types of addiction, what types of patients, and under what conditions. Overall, current findings increasingly support yoga and mindfulness as promising complementary therapies for treating and preventing addictive behaviors.	Khanna, Surbhi;Greeson, Jeffrey M	2013 Jun

23639275	Embodied health: the effects of a mind-body course for medical students.	OBJECTIVE: An effective career in medicine requires empathy and compassion, yet the demands of a medical education increase stress and decrease students' ability to connect with patients. However, research suggests mind-body practices improve psychological well-being. This study aimed to evaluate the psychological effects on medical students of an 11-week elective course, Embodied Health or EH, which combines yoga and meditation with neuroscience didactics. METHODS: The effects on 27 first- and second-year medical students were evaluated via surveys in four areas: empathy, perceived stress, self-regulation, and self-compassion. Scales used were 1. Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy, which measures empathy among health students and professionals and medical students on a scale of 1 (least empathetic) to 7 (most empathetic); 2. Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale, a measure of the perceived uncontrollability of respondents' lives, from 0 (least stressed) to 4 (most stressed); 3. Self-Regulation Questionnaire, which measures the development and maintenance of planned behavior to achieve goals, from 1 (least self-regulated) to 5 (most self-regulated); and 4. Self-Compassion Scale, which measures self-criticism, from 1 (least self-compassionate) to 5 (most self-compassionate). Students also reflected on EH's impact on their well-being in a post-course essay. RESULTS: Self-regulation and self-compassion rose 0.13 (SD 0.20, p=0.003) and 0.28 (SD 0.61, p=0.04), respectively. Favorable changes were also seen in empathy and perceived stress, which went up by 0.11 (SD 0.50, p=0.30) and down by 0.05 (SD 0.62, p=0.70), respectively; these changes did not reach statistical significance. Students' essays were found to discuss the following recurrent themes: 1) Reconnection between mind and body; 2) Community in a competitive environment; 3) Increased mindfulness; 4) Confidence in use of mind-body skills with patients; and 5) Stress management. These themes overlapped with the measures EH affected quantitatively. CONCLUSION: A mind-body course for medical students increased self-regulation and self-compassion. Qualitative themes discussed in students' post-course essays reflected these effects.

23632236	A systematic review of complementary and alternative medicine interventions for the management of cancer-related fatigue.	Fatigue, experienced by patients during and following cancer treatment, is a significant clinical problem. It is a prevalent and distressing symptom yet pharmacological interventions are used little and confer limited benefit for patients. However, many cancer patients use some form of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), and some evidence suggests it may relieve fatigue. A systematic review was conducted to appraise the effectiveness of CAM interventions in ameliorating cancer-related fatigue. Systematic searches of biomedical, nursing, and specialist CAM databases were conducted, including Medline, Embase, and AMED. Included papers described interventions classified as CAM by the National Centre of Complementary and Alternative Medicine and evaluated through randomized controlled trial (RCT) or quasi-experimental design. Twenty studies were eligible for the review, of which 15 were RCTs. Forms of CAM interventions examined included acupuncture, massage, yoga, and relaxation training. The review identified some limited evidence suggesting hypnosis and ginseng may prevent rises in cancer-related fatigue in people undergoing treatment for cancer and acupuncture and that biofield healing may reduce cancer-related fatigue following cancer treatments. Evidence to date suggests that multivitamins are ineffective at reducing cancer-related fatigue. However, trials incorporated within the review varied greatly in quality; most were methodologically weak and at high risk of bias. Consequently, there is currently insufficient evidence to conclude with certainty the effectiveness or otherwise of CAM in reducing cancer-related fatigue. The design and methods employed in future trials of CAM should be more rigorous; increasing the strength of evidence should be a priority.

23627902	Structural characterization and molecular order of rodlike mesogens with three- and four-ring core by XRD and 13C NMR spectroscopy.	Structural characterizations using XRD and (13)C NMR spectroscopy of two rodlike mesogens consisting of (i) three phenyl ring core with a polar cyano terminal and (ii) four phenyl ring core with flexible dodecyl terminal chain are presented. The three-ring-core mesogen with cyano terminal exhibits enantiotropic smectic A phase while the four-ring mesogen reveals polymesomorphism and shows enantiotropic nematic, smectic C, and tilted hexatic phases. The molecular organization in the three-ring mesogen is found to be partial bilayer smectic Ad type, and the interdigitation of the molecules in the neighboring layers is attributed to the presence of the polar terminal group. For the four-ring mesogen, the XRD results confirm the existence of the smectic C and the tilted hexatic mesophases. A thermal variation of the layer spacing across the smectic C phase followed by a discrete jump at the transition to the tilted hexatic phase is also observed. The tilt angles have been estimated to be about 45 degrees in the smectic C phase and about 40 degrees in tilted hexatic phase. (13)C NMR results indicate that in the mesophase the molecules are aligned parallel to the magnetic field. From the (13)C-(1)H dipolar couplings determined from the 2D experiments, the overall order parameter for the three-ring mesogen in its smectic A phase has been estimated to be 0.72 while values ranging from 0.88 to 0.44 have been obtained for the four-ring mesogen as it passes from the tilted hexatic to the nematic phase. The orientations of the different rings of the core unit with respect to each other and also with respect to the long axis of the molecule have also been obtained.

23625559	Thoraco-abdominal deflection responses of post mortem human surrogates in side impacts.	The objective of the present study was to determine the thorax and abdomen deflections sustained by post mortem human surrogate (PMHS) in oblique side impact sled tests and compare the responses and injuries with pure lateral tests. Oblique impact tests were conducted using modular and non-modular load-wall designs, with the former capable of accommodating varying anthropometry. Tests were conducted at 6.7 m/s velocity. Deflection responses from chestbands were analyzed from 15 PMHS tests: five each from modular load-wall oblique, non-modular load-wall oblique and non-modular load- wall pure lateral impacts. The thorax and abdomen peak deflections were greater in non-modular load-wall oblique than pure lateral tests. Peak abdomen deflections were statistically significantly different while the upper thorax deflections demonstrated a trend towards significance. Deflection angulations were statistically significantly different between pure lateral and oblique tests at all regions indicating that it is important to characterize not only the amplitude but also the angle of the vector. Injuries were confined to skeletal regions in pure lateral tests and this was in contrast to the occurrence of both skeletal and soft tissue/organ injury in oblique loading tests, again emphasizing the role of obliqueness in side impacts. Furthermore, injuries in oblique tests were primarily unilateral, paralleling real-world trauma and confirming the applicability of the experimental design to field environments. Potential injury mechanisms are discussed based on anatomical considerations. These findings, albeit from a limited sample size, underscore the need for additional studies to derive human injury tolerance and criteria in oblique side impacts.

23620650	The role of fibrosis in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.	Muscular dystrophies such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are usually approached as dysfunctions of the affected skeletal myofibres and their force transmission. Comparatively little attention has been given to the increase in connective tissue (fibrosis) which accompanies these muscular changes. Interestingly, an increase in endomysial tissue is apparent long before any muscular degeneration can be observed. Fibrosis is the result of a reactive or reparative process involving mechanical, humoral and cellular factors. Originating from vulnerable myofibres, muscle cell necrosis and inflammatory processes are present in DMD. Muscular recovery is limited due to the limited number and capacity of satellite cells. Hence, a proactive and multimodal approach is necessary in order to activate protective mechanisms and to hinder catabolic and tissue degrading pathways. Several avenues are discussed in terms of potential antifibrotic therapy approaches. These include pharmaceutical, nutritional, exercise-based and other mechanostimulatory modalities (such as massage or yoga-like stretching) with the intention of exerting an anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effect on the affected muscular tissues. A preventive intervention at an early age is crucial, based on the early and seemingly non-reversible nature of the fibrotic tissue changes. Since consistent assessment is essential, different measurement technologies are discussed.	Klingler, Werner;Jurkat-Rott, Karin;Lehmann-Horn, Frank;Schleip, Robert	2012 Dec
23616973	An assessment of the effects of Iyengar yoga practice on the health-related quality of life of patients with chronic respiratory diseases: a pilot study.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of an Iyengar yoga program (IYP) on patients with chronic respiratory diseases. METHODS: Patients attending lung transplant clinics in a tertiary institution were invited to participate in a two-phase, 12-week IYP that included 2 h biweekly classes. Doctors completed a formal physical and clinical assessment on candidates before enrollment. Patients with New York Association Class III or IV, or dyspnea grade IV were excluded. At baseline and at the end of 12-weeks, patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) and Health Utilities Index (HUI). Medication(s), 6 min walk test results and other clinical parameters were also recorded. Patients recorded the effects of the IYP on their daily living in journals. Nonparametric and qualitative methods were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients diagnosed with pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (mean age 60 years) were invited to participate. At the end of the 12-week period, changes in HADS anxiety and CRQ fatigue scores were statistically significant (P<0.05) and changes in HUI ambulation, pain, emotion and overall score were clinically important. The content of the journals revealed patients' improvement in breathing capacity, mobility, energy, sleep and included positive feedback such as: "increased tidal volume with slowing expiration", "I have an overall feeling of wellbeing" and "excellent amount of energy". CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that yoga has significant potential to produce benefits. Potential benefits will be further explored in a national multisite study.

23613970	Rapid gene expression changes in peripheral blood lymphocytes upon practice of a comprehensive yoga program.	One of the most common integrative medicine (IM) modalities is yoga and related practices. Previous work has shown that yoga may improve wellness in healthy people and have benefits for patients. However, the mechanisms of how yoga may positively affect the mind-body system are largely unknown. Here we have assessed possible rapid changes in global gene expression profiles in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in healthy people that practiced either a comprehensive yoga program or a control regimen. The experimental sessions included gentle yoga postures, breathing exercises, and meditation (Sudarshan Kriya and Related Practices--SK&P) compared with a control regimen of a nature walk and listening to relaxing music. We show that the SK&P program has a rapid and significantly greater effect on gene expression in PBMCs compared with the control regimen. These data suggest that yoga and related practices result in rapid gene expression alterations which may be the basis for their longer term cell biological and higher level health effects.

23609463	Mind-body practices for posttraumatic stress disorder.	BACKGROUND: Mind-body practices are increasingly used to provide stress reduction for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Mind-body practice encompasses activities with the intent to use the mind to impact physical functioning and improve health. METHODS: This is a literature review using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Published International Literature on Traumatic Stress to identify the effects of mind-body intervention modalities, such as yoga, tai chi, qigong, mindfulness-based stress reduction, meditation, and deep breathing, as interventions for PTSD. RESULTS: The literature search identified 92 articles, only 16 of which were suitable for inclusion in this review. We reviewed only original, full text articles that met the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies have small sample size, but findings from the 16 publications reviewed here suggest that mind-body practices are associated with positive impacts on PTSD symptoms. Mind-body practices incorporate numerous therapeutic effects on stress responses, including reductions in anxiety, depression, and anger, and increases in pain tolerance, self-esteem, energy levels, ability to relax, and ability to cope with stressful situations. In general, mind-body practices were found to be a viable intervention to improve the constellation of PTSD symptoms such as intrusive memories, avoidance, and increased emotional arousal. CONCLUSIONS: Mind-body practices are increasingly used in the treatment of PTSD and are associated with positive impacts on stress-induced illnesses such as depression and PTSD in most existing studies. Knowledge about the diverse modalities of mind-body practices may provide clinicians and patients with the opportunity to explore an individualized and effective treatment plan enhanced by mind-body interventions as part of ongoing self-care.

23608661	Beyond medications and diet: alternative approaches to lowering blood pressure: a scientific statement from the american heart association.	Many antihypertensive medications and lifestyle changes are proven to reduce blood pressure. Over the past few decades, numerous additional modalities have been evaluated in regard to their potential blood pressure-lowering abilities. However, these nondietary, nondrug treatments, collectively called alternative approaches, have generally undergone fewer and less rigorous trials. This American Heart Association scientific statement aims to summarize the blood pressure-lowering efficacy of several alternative approaches and to provide a class of recommendation for their implementation in clinical practice based on the available level of evidence from the published literature. Among behavioral therapies, Transcendental Meditation (Class IIB, Level of Evidence B), other meditation techniques (Class III, Level of Evidence C), yoga (Class III, Level of Evidence C), other relaxation therapies (Class III, Level of Evidence B), and biofeedback approaches (Class IIB, Level of Evidence B) generally had modest, mixed, or no consistent evidence demonstrating their efficacy. Between the noninvasive procedures and devices evaluated, device-guided breathing (Class IIA, Level of Evidence B) had greater support than acupuncture (Class III, Level of Evidence B). Exercise-based regimens, including aerobic (Class I, Level of Evidence A), dynamic resistance (Class IIA, Level of Evidence B), and isometric handgrip (Class IIB, Level of Evidence C) modalities, had relatively stronger supporting evidence. It is the consensus of the writing group that it is reasonable for all individuals with blood pressure levels >120/80 mm Hg to consider trials of alternative approaches as adjuvant methods to help lower blood pressure when clinically appropriate. A suggested management algorithm is provided, along with recommendations for prioritizing the use of the individual approaches in clinical practice based on their level of evidence for blood pressure lowering, risk-to-benefit ratio, potential ancillary health benefits, and practicality in a real-world setting. Finally, recommendations for future research priorities are outlined.

23603827	Distinct binding properties of TIAR RRMs and linker region.	The RNA-binding protein TIAR is an mRNA-binding protein that acts as a translational repressor, particularly important under conditions of cellular stress. It binds to target mRNA and DNA via its RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains and is involved in both splicing regulation and translational repression via the formation of "stress granules." TIAR has also been shown to bind ssDNA and play a role in the regulation of transcription. Here we show, using surface plasmon resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, specific roles of individual TIAR domains for high-affinity binding to RNA and DNA targets. We confirm that RRM2 of TIAR is the major RNA- and DNA-binding domain. However, the strong nanomolar affinity binding to U-rich RNA and T-rich DNA depends on the presence of the six amino acid residues found in the linker region C-terminal to RRM2. On its own, RRM1 shows preferred binding to DNA over RNA. We further characterize the interaction between RRM2 with the C-terminal extension and an AU-rich target RNA sequence using NMR spectroscopy to identify the amino acid residues involved in binding. We demonstrate that TIAR RRM2, together with its C-terminal extension, is the major contributor for the high-affinity (nM) interactions of TIAR with target RNA sequences.

23595161	Comprehensive Approach to Lower Blood Pressure (CALM-BP): a randomized controlled trial of a multifactorial lifestyle intervention.	Complementary medicine advocates the use of a multifactorial approach to address the varied aspects of hypertension. The aim of this study was to compare the blood pressure (BP) effect and medication use of a novel Comprehensive Approach to Lowering Measured Blood Pressure (CALM-BP), based on complementary medicine principles, with the standard recommended Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH). A total of 113 patients treated with antihypertensive drugs were randomly assigned to either CALM-BP treatment (consisting of rice diet, walks, yoga, relaxation and stress management) or to a DASH+exercise control group (consisting of DASH and walks). Ambulatory 24-h and home BP were monitored over a 16-week programme, followed by 6 months of maintenance period. Medications were reduced if systolic BP dropped below 110 mm Hg accompanied by symptoms. In addition to BP reduction, medications were reduced because of symptomatic hypotension in 70.7% of the CALM-BP group compared with 32.7% in the DASH group, P<0.0001. After 6 months, medication status was not altered in the majority of individuals. Significant reductions in body mass index, cholesterol and improved quality-of-life scores were observed only in the CALM-BP group. Lifestyle and diet modifications based on complementary medicine principles are highly effective with respect to BP control, medication use and cardiovascular risk factors.

23594451	Yoga reduces performance anxiety in adolescent musicians.	CONTEXT: Professional musicians often experience high levels of stress, music performance anxiety (MPA), and performance-related musculoskeletal disorders (PRMDs). Given the fact that most professional musicians begin their musical training before the age of 12, it is important to identify interventions that will address these issues from an early age. OBJECTIVE: This study intended to replicate and expand upon adult research in this area by evaluating the effects of a yoga intervention on MPA and PRMDs in a population of adolescent musicians. The present study was the first to examine these effects. DESIGN: The research team assigned participants, adolescent musicians, into two groups. The intervention group (n = 84) took part in a 6-wk yoga program, and the control group (n = 51) received no treatment. The team evaluated the effects of the yoga intervention by comparing the scores of the intervention group to those of the control group on a number of questionnaires related to MPA and PRMDs. SETTING: The study was conducted at the Boston University Tanglewood Institute (BUTI). BUTI is a training academy for advanced adolescent musicians, located in Lenox, Massachusetts. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were adolescent, residential music students (mean age = 16 y) in a 6-wk summer program at the BUTI in 2007 and 2008. INTERVENTION: Participants in the yoga intervention group were requested to attend three, 60-min, Kripalustyle yoga classes each wk for 6 wk. OUTCOME MEASURES: MPA was measured using the Performance Anxiety Questionnaire (PAQ) and the Music Performance Anxiety Inventory for Adolescents (MPAI-A). PRMDs were measured using the Performance-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders Questionnaire (PRMD-Q). RESULTS * Yoga participants showed statistically significant reductions in MPA from baseline to the end of the program compared to the control group, as measured by several subscales of the PAQ and MPAI-A; however, the results for PRMDs were inconsistent. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that yoga may be a promising way for adolescents to reduce MPA and perhaps even prevent it in the future. These findings also suggest a novel treatment modality that potentially might alleviate MPA and prevent the early disruption and termination of musical careers.

23594056	A systematic review on physical therapy interventions for patients with binge eating disorder.	PURPOSE: Since a distorted body experience and a sedentary lifestyle are central in the course of binge eating disorder (BED), physical therapy might be an interesting add-on treatment. The aim of this study was to systematically review randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating physical therapy on binge eating and physical and mental health in BED patients. METHOD: EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Physiotherapy Evidence Database and Cochrane Library were searched from their inception until 15 August 2012 for relevant RCTs comparing physical therapy with a placebo condition, control intervention or standard care. RESULTS: Three RCTs involving 211 female community patients (age range: 25-63 years) met all selection criteria. Review data demonstrate that aerobic and yoga exercises reduce the number of binges and the body mass index (BMI) of BED patients. Aerobic exercise also reduces depressive symptoms. Only combining cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with aerobic exercise and not CBT alone reduces BMI. Combining aerobic exercise with CBT is more effective in reducing depressive symptoms than CBT alone. CONCLUSIONS: The limited number of available studies and the heterogeneity of the interventions limit overall conclusions and highlight the need for further research. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: Because of severe co-morbid psychiatric and physical conditions, binge eating disorder is one of the most difficult psychiatric conditions to treat. Both yoga and aerobic exercise have shown promise in reducing binge eating pathology and weight. Combining aerobic exercise with cognitive behavioural therapy seems more effective in reducing depressive symptoms than cognitive behavioural therapy alone.

23578913	Keeping the balance--an overview of mind-body therapies in pediatric oncology.	This overview aims to give a brief introduction for clinicians in the wide field of Mind-Body Therapies (MBTs), to summarize the current research status of MBTs in pediatric oncology and to mention challenges for future goals. Most used techniques (relaxation, hypnosis, yoga, massage, MBSR, eurythmy) will be described and efficacy will be discussed. MBTs are an enhancement of conventional medicine to motivate the patient to participate in his recovery. Most MBTs are of low risk and are accessible for patients and their families in nearly all stadium of cancer therapy. Positive results include increased self-confidence and a more optimistic view in coping with the illness. We encourage clinicians to be more aware of the promising field of MBTs and its use in pediatric oncology.	Kanitz, Jenny Lena;Camus, Maria Eugenia Moneta;Seifert, Georg	2013 Apr
23574691	Effect of an office worksite-based yoga program on heart rate variability: outcomes of a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Chronic work-related stress is an independent risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases and associated mortality, particularly when compounded by a sedentary work environment. The purpose of this study was to determine if an office worksite-based hatha yoga program could improve physiological stress, evaluated via heart rate variability (HRV), and associated health-related outcomes in a cohort of office workers. METHODS: Thirty-seven adults employed in university-based office positions were randomized upon the completion of baseline testing to an experimental or control group. The experimental group completed a 10-week yoga program prescribed three sessions per week during lunch hour (50 min per session). An experienced instructor led the sessions, which emphasized asanas (postures) and vinyasa (exercises). The primary outcome was the high frequency (HF) power component of HRV. Secondary outcomes included additional HRV parameters, musculoskeletal fitness (i.e. push-up, side-bridge, and sit & reach tests) and psychological indices (i.e. state and trait anxiety, quality of life and job satisfaction). RESULTS: All measures of HRV failed to change in the experimental group versus the control group, except that the experimental group significantly increased LF:HF (p = 0.04) and reduced pNN50 (p = 0.04) versus control, contrary to our hypotheses. Flexibility, evaluated via sit & reach test increased in the experimental group versus the control group (p < 0.001). No other adaptations were noted. Post hoc analysis comparing participants who completed >/=70% of yoga sessions (n = 11) to control (n = 19) yielded the same findings, except that the high adherers also reduced state anxiety (p = 0.02) and RMSSD (p = 0.05), and tended to improve the push-up test (p = 0.07) versus control. CONCLUSIONS: A 10-week hatha yoga intervention delivered at the office worksite during lunch hour did not improve HF power or other HRV parameters. However, improvements in flexibility, state anxiety and musculoskeletal fitness were noted with high adherence. Future investigations should incorporate strategies to promote adherence, involve more frequent and longer durations of yoga training, and enrol cohorts who suffer from higher levels of work-related stress.

23569397	Complementary and alternative exercise for fibromyalgia: a meta-analysis.	Complementary and alternative medicine includes a number of exercise modalities, such as tai chi, qigong, yoga, and a variety of lesser-known movement therapies. A meta-analysis of the current literature was conducted estimating the effect size of the different modalities, study quality and bias, and adverse events. The level of research has been moderately weak to date, but most studies report a medium-to-high effect size in pain reduction. Given the lack of adverse events, there is little risk in recommending these modalities as a critical component in a multimodal treatment plan, which is often required for fibromyalgia management.

23561064	The impact of Yoga upon young adult cancer survivors.	This study explored the use of Yoga by using a cross-sectional analysis of 286 young adult cancer survivors. The aim was to explore yoga practice, reasons for using this therapy; predictors of yoga use and any potential relationship between yoga use and well-being. Ninety one participants (32.82%) reported practicing yoga from their initial diagnosis. Practitioners reported a relatively high intensity (mean: 7.46 h/month) and length (25.88 months) of practice. The most common reasons given for undertaking yoga were to maintain flexibility and promote relaxation. Sociodemographic predictors of yoga use included gender, higher education with increased yoga use generally related to enhanced feelings of well-being. Results suggest that yoga use is more commonly used by cancer survivors with greater resources. Understanding more about the use of yoga by cancer survivors may facilitate the development and promotion of yoga-based interventions.	Park, Crystal L;Cho, Dalnim;Wortmann, Jennifer H	2013 May
23559785	Self evolution: 1(st) domain of spiritual health.	While measuring physical, mental, and social health as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), the basis of measurement is in terms of Determinants. Recently with the advent of health promotion activities, the emphasis is on enabling individuals, groups, and societies to have control on these Determinants. To measure the spiritual health, the 4(th) Dimension, a Spiritual Health Scale consisting of 3 Domains, 6 Constructs, and 27 Determinants of spiritual health were identified through a scientific process. A statistically reliable and valid Spiritual Health Scale (SHS 2011) containing 114 items has been developed. Construct validity and test-retest reliability has been established. The 3 Domains are: Self-Evolution, Self-Actualization, and Transcendence. In this article, the process of self evolution in terms of "Wider Perspective" and "Nurturance-Art" have been captured through the Determinants like Commitment, Introspection, Honesty, Creativity, Contemplation, Prayer, Philanthropy, Extending Self, Empathy, Yoga and Exercise, Questioning Injustice, Aesthetics, Value for Time, and Being Away From Comparisons.

28496826	Alternative Therapies in the Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation.	Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinical arrhythmia and represents a major social and economic problem. The number of subjects with AF is constantly increasing as a result of aging and improved survival in several cardiac and non-cardiac diseases. Patients with AF are often symptomatic, have a reduced physical capacity and are at high risk for thromboembolic events. Moreover, AF is associated with increased mortality and independent of the management, based either on rhythm or rate control strategy. The safety and efficacy of most anti-arrhythmic drugs are questionable. Increasing attention has therefore been addressed to evaluate the possible therapeutic and/or preventive effects of forms of treatment coming from ancient medical traditions of Far East, like acupuncture and yoga. In traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture has been found effective in managing patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Recently, also in the Western literature, reports have been published supporting the clinical efficacy of acupuncture to treat arterial hypertension and to reduce chest pain. Other studies have evaluated the effects of acupuncture and other methods of Eastern Medicine, i.e., Qigong, Tai Chi Chuan and Yoga, in the treatment of cardiac illnesses associated with supraventricular arrhythmias. Two reports on the effects of acupuncture in preventing or reducing the rate of AF recurrences in patients with persistent or paroxysmal AF have been recently reported . Another ancient traditional eastern form of therapy and prevention, i.e., yoga, has been recently shown to reduce episodes of atrial fibrillation and improve the symptoms of anxiety and depression often associated with this arrhythmia. Growing evidence indicates that acupuncture and yoga are safe, without any pro-arrhythmic effect and with limited cost. All these factors should be considered when evaluating the efficacy of therapeutic intervention for an epidemic disease such as AF.

23548052	A pilot study of yoga as self-care for arthritis in minority communities.	BACKGROUND: While arthritis is the most common cause of disability, non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics experience worse arthritis impact despite having the same or lower prevalence of arthritis compared to non-Hispanic whites. People with arthritis who exercise regularly have less pain, more energy, and improved sleep, yet arthritis is one of the most common reasons for limiting physical activity. Mind-body interventions, such as yoga, that teach stress management along with physical activity may be well suited for investigation in both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Yoga users are predominantly white, female, and college educated. There are few studies that examine yoga in minority populations; none address arthritis. This paper presents a study protocol examining the feasibility and acceptability of providing yoga to an urban, minority population with arthritis. METHODS/DESIGN: In this ongoing pilot study, a convenience sample of 20 minority adults diagnosed with either osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis undergo an 8-week program of yoga classes. It is believed that by attending yoga classes designed for patients with arthritis, with racially concordant instructors; acceptability of yoga as an adjunct to standard arthritis treatment and self-care will be enhanced. Self-care is defined as adopting behaviors that improve physical and mental well-being. This concept is quantified through collecting patient-reported outcome measures related to spiritual growth, health responsibility, interpersonal relations, and stress management. Additional measures collected during this study include: physical function, anxiety/depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, social roles, and pain; as well as baseline demographic and clinical data. Field notes, quantitative and qualitative data regarding feasibility and acceptability are also collected. Acceptability is determined by response/retention rates, positive qualitative data, and continuing yoga practice after three months. DISCUSSION: There are a number of challenges in recruiting and retaining participants from a community clinic serving minority populations. Adopting behaviors that improve well-being and quality of life include those that integrate mental health (mind) and physical health (body). Few studies have examined offering integrative modalities to this population. This pilot was undertaken to quantify measures of feasibility and acceptability that will be useful when evaluating future plans for expanding the study of yoga in urban, minority populations with arthritis.

23541163	Randomized controlled trial of mindfulness meditation for generalized anxiety disorder: effects on anxiety and stress reactivity.	OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness meditation has met increasing interest as a therapeutic strategy for anxiety disorders, but prior studies have been limited by methodological concerns, including a lack of an active comparison group. This is the first randomized, controlled trial comparing the manualized Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program with an active control for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), a disorder characterized by chronic worry and physiologic hyperarousal symptoms. METHOD: Ninety-three individuals with DSM-IV-diagnosed GAD were randomly assigned to an 8-week group intervention with MBSR or to an attention control, Stress Management Education (SME), between 2009 and 2011. Anxiety symptoms were measured with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA; primary outcome measure), the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness and -Improvement scales (CGI-S and CGI-I), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Stress reactivity was assessed by comparing anxiety and distress during pretreatment and posttreatment administration of the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). RESULTS: A modified intent-to-treat analysis including participants who completed at least 1 session of MBSR (n = 48) or SME (n = 41) showed that both interventions led to significant (P < .0001) reductions in HAMA scores at endpoint, but did not significantly differ. MBSR, however, was associated with a significantly greater reduction in anxiety as measured by the CGI-S, the CGI-I, and the BAI (all P values < .05). MBSR was also associated with greater reductions than SME in anxiety and distress ratings in response to the TSST stress challenge (P < .05) and a greater increase in positive self-statements (P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that MBSR may have a beneficial effect on anxiety symptoms in GAD and may also improve stress reactivity and coping as measured in a laboratory stress challenge.

23538080	Science of the mind: ancient yoga texts and modern studies.	The practice of yoga is gaining in popularity with a wide range of practices. Recent research and descriptions from the ancient texts are often concurrent with regard to the effects of the practice, taking into account expected differences between modern scientific terms and those used in the original texts. Voluntarily regulated yoga breathing practices form a bridge between physical and mental changes. The voluntarily regulated yoga breathing has distinct effects on metabolism, the autonomic nervous system, higher brain functions, and mental state. The effects of meditation on the nervous system and mental state are even clearer.	Telles, Shirley;Singh, Nilkamal	2013 Mar
23533465	Medical yoga for patients with stress-related symptoms and diagnoses in primary health care: a randomized controlled trial.	An increasing number of patients are suffering from stress-related symptoms and diagnoses. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the medical yoga treatment in patients with stress-related symptoms and diagnoses in primary health care. A randomized controlled study was performed at a primary health care centre in Sweden from March to June, 2011. Patients were randomly allocated to a control group receiving standard care or a yoga group treated with medical yoga for 1 hour, once a week, over a 12-week period in addition to the standard care. A total of 37 men and women, mean age of 53 +/- 12 years were included. General stress level (measured using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)), burnout (Shirom-Melamed Burnout Questionnaire (SMBQ)), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)), insomnia severity (Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)), pain (visual analogue scale (VAS)), and overall health status (Euro Quality of Life VAS (EQ-VAS)) were measured before and after 12 weeks. Patients assigned to the Yoga group showed significantly greater improvements on measures of general stress level (P < 0.000), anxiety (P < 0.019), and overall health status (P < 0.018) compared to controls. Treatment with medical yoga is effective in reducing levels of stress and anxiety in patients with stress-related symptoms in primary health care.

23529519	Mind-body therapies--use in chronic pain management.	BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is a common presentation to general practice. OBJECTIVE: This article explores the role of the mind in the experience of pain and describes how mind-body techniques can be used in the management of chronic pain. DISCUSSION: The mind, emotions and attention play an important role in the experience of pain. In patients with chronic pain, stress, fear and depression can amplify the perception of pain. Mind-body approaches act to change a person's mental or emotional state or utilise physical movement to train attention or produce mental relaxation. They are occasionally used as a sole treatment, but more commonly as adjuncts to other therapies. Mind-body approaches include progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, laughter, mindfulness based approaches, hypnosis, guided imagery, yoga, biofeedback and cognitive behavioural therapy. Studies have shown that mind-body approaches can be effective in various conditions associated with chronic pain, however levels of evidence vary. Group delivered courses with healthcare professional input may have more beneficial effects than individual therapy. General practitioners are well placed to recommend or learn and provide a range of mind-body approaches to improve outcomes for patients with chronic pain.	Hassed, Craig	2013 Mar
23506189	Treatment of pregnancy-related lumbar and pelvic girdle pain by the yoga method: a randomized controlled study.	OBJECTIVE: Pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain is a major problem for the majority of pregnant women. Complementary medicine has been used to alleviate pain, and yoga is one of the most commonly chosen alternative methods. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of Hatha yoga in the reduction of lumbopelvic pain in pregnancy. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial with 60 pregnant women (age range, 14-40 years) who reported lumbopelvic pain at 12 to 32 weeks of gestation was conducted from June 2009 to June 2011. Pregnant women who had twin pregnancies, had medical restrictions for exercise, used analgesics, and participated in physical therapy were excluded from the study. Pregnant women were divided into two groups: the yoga group, practicing exercises guided by this method, and the postural orientation group, performing standardized posture orientation according to instructions provided in a pamphlet. Treatment in each group lasted 10 weeks. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to measure pain intensity. Lumbar pain and posterior pelvic pain provocation tests were used to confirm the presence of pain. Statistical analysis included the Mann-Whitney test, the McNemar test, a paired Wilcoxon test, and analysis of covariance. RESULTS: The median pain score was lower in the yoga group (p<.0058) than the postural orientation group. Lumbar pain provocation tests showed a decreased response in relation to posterior pelvic pain provocation tests and a gradual reduction in pain intensity during 10 yoga sessions (p<.024). CONCLUSIONS: The yoga method was more effective at reducing lumbopelvic pain intensity compared with postural orientation.	Martins, Roseny Flavia;Pinto e Silva, Joao Luiz	2014 Jan
23499714	Self care integrative treatment demonstrated in rural community setting improves health related quality of life of lymphatic filariasis patients in endemic villages.	This study assessed impact of community based self care integrative treatment provided through mass camps in villages of three districts of Kerala, India endemic for lymphatic filariasis (LF). Two most endemic Primary Health centres (PHCs) were selected from each of the three districts, where maximum concentration of LF patients is recorded. Fourteen one day LF camps, each attended by 30-40 patients were conducted. Trained Accredited Social Health Activists encouraged LF patients to attend camps. Skin wash and drying, care of bacterial entry points using dermatology drugs, and simple yoga and breathing exercises were demonstrated in these camps. Patients were advised to continue these self care activities daily at home for six months. The quality of life (QoL) of LF patients was determined for Indian life style domains using validated and pretested specific questionnaire (LF-specific QoL questionnaire-LFSQQ). It addressed conditions and state of individuals with reference to LF. The questionnaire had 7 domains and each domain consisted of a series of questions with likert scale (no problem, mild, moderate, severe, most severe). 446 patients attended one day camps to get training on integrative self care treatment. 425 patients (95.3%) were followed up after six months and QoL was reassessed. Each patient's QoL in mobility, self care, usual activity, pain and discomfort and social relationship significantly improved (P value <0.01). Psychological health showed no significant change. The disease burden, for the purpose of the study was measured by asking questions about history of painful redness, swelling and cellulitis of legs (filarial fever), foul smell (odor), itching (eczema/discharge from limb), wound (non healing ulcer) and weight/size of the limb. The difference in disease burden as recorded during the sixth month follow up was measured using dependent t test, reduced significantly (P value <0.01) in 409 (96.2%) patients. 103 (24.2%) patients experienced fever during follow up. Severity of inflammatory episodes reduced from severe problem to no problem, after six months of home based self care. There was significant relation between treatment regularity and QoL status (P value=0.003). The community based one day camps that trained LF patients on skin care and daily yoga and breathing practices improved QoL.

23497959	Prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use by menopausal women: a systematic review of surveys.	Large proportions of women have turned to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for relief from their menopausal symptoms. This highlights the need for more rigorous research into CAM. This article is aimed at critically reviewing surveys that examine the prevalence of CAM use by menopausal women worldwide. Eleven databases were searched for peer-reviewed surveys published in any language between 01 January 2000 and 27 October 2012. The bibliographies of the retrieved articles and relevant book chapters were also hand searched. Twenty-six surveys were identified, and they included a total of 32,465 menopausal women. The majority of these surveys were of poor methodological quality. Based on 6 surveys, 32.9% of women stated they were current/regular CAM users. Based on 9 surveys, 50.5% of women reported that they used CAM specifically for their menopausal symptoms. The average 12-month prevalence of CAM use was 47.7% (range: 33.1-56.2). Fifty-five percent of women did not disclose their use of CAM to their healthcare professional. The majority of women sought information about CAM from the media. The most popular CAM modality was herbal medicine, followed by soy/phytoestrogens, evening primrose oil, relaxation and yoga. There are a large number of predominantly low-quality surveys monitoring the prevalence of CAM use among menopausal women worldwide. The available evidence suggests that the prevalence of CAM use is high.	Posadzki, P;Lee, M S;Moon, T W;Choi, T Y;Park, T Y;Ernst, E	2013 May
23486503	Prevalence, putative mechanisms, and current management of sleep problems during chemotherapy for cancer.	Sleep problems are highly prevalent in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. This article reviews existing evidence on etiology, associated symptoms, and management of sleep problems associated with chemotherapy treatment during cancer. It also discusses limitations and methodological issues of current research. The existing literature suggests that subjectively and objectively measured sleep problems are the highest during the chemotherapy phase of cancer treatments. A possibly involved mechanism reviewed here includes the rise in the circulating proinflammatory cytokines and the associated disruption in circadian rhythm in the development and maintenance of sleep dysregulation in cancer patients during chemotherapy. Various approaches to the management of sleep problems during chemotherapy are discussed with behavioral intervention showing promise. Exercise, including yoga, also appear to be effective and safe at least for subclinical levels of sleep problems in cancer patients. Numerous challenges are associated with conducting research on sleep in cancer patients during chemotherapy treatments and they are discussed in this review. Dedicated intervention trials, methodologically sound and sufficiently powered, are needed to test current and novel treatments of sleep problems in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Optimal management of sleep problems in patients with cancer receiving treatment may improve not only the well-being of patients, but also their prognosis given the emerging experimental and clinical evidence suggesting that sleep disruption might adversely impact treatment and recovery from cancer.

23483831	Chronic physical illness: a psychophysiological approach for chronic physical illness.	Growing evidence demonstrates that psychological risk variables can contribute to physical disease. In an effort to thoroughly investigate potential etiological origins and optimal interventions, this broad review is divided into five sections: the stress response, chronic diseases, mind-body theoretical models, psychophysiological interventions, and integrated health care solutions. The stress response and its correlation to chronic disorders such as cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, autoimmune, metabolic syndrome, and chronic pain are comprehensively explored. Current mind-body theoretical models, including peripheral nerve pathway, neurophysiological, and integrative theories, are reviewed to elucidate the biological mechanisms behind psychophysiological interventions. Specific interventions included are psychotherapy, mindfulness meditation, yoga, and psychopharmacology. Finally, the author advocates for an integrated care approach as a means by which to blur the sharp distinction between physical and psychological health. Integrated care approaches can utilize psychiatric nurse practitioners for behavioral assessment, intervention, research, advocacy, consultation, and education to optimize health outcomes.

23480018	Yoga as an alternative and complementary treatment for cancer: a systematic review.	OBJECTIVES: Cancer is an important public health concern, with millions of patients affected worldwide. Given the physical, psychological, and physiologic changes associated with cancer, holistic therapies are needed to treat all aspect of the disease. DESIGN: A systematic review was conducted to determine the efficacy of yoga as a treatment option for cancer since 2010. Included studies were published from January 2010 to July 2012 and were indexed in MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Alt HealthWatch. RESULTS: Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Eight of these studies were performed in the United States, and one each was conducted in Slovenia, Italy, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Turkey. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for efficacy of yoga as an alternative and complementary treatment for cancer is mixed, although generally positive. Limitations of the reviewed interventions included a mixed use of instruments, weak quantitative designs, small sample sizes, and a lack of theory-based studies.

23466111	Yoga-based intervention for caregivers of outpatients with psychosis: a randomized controlled pilot study.	PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The use of yoga as an intervention for caregivers of patients with psychosis has been poorly studied. The current study aimed to test the efficacy of a brief yoga program as an intervention in caregivers of outpatients with functional psychotic disorders using a randomized controlled research design. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Caregivers who agreed to participate in the study (n=29) were randomized into yoga (n=15) or wait-list group (n=14). They were assessed at baseline and at the end of 3 months. Patients who were randomized into the yoga group were offered supervised yoga training thrice a week for 4 weeks, after which they were instructed to practice at home for the next 2 months. Due to the small sample size and some variables not being normally distributed, non-parametric statistical analysis was used. RESULTS: Results showed significantly reduced burden scores and improved quality of life scores in the yoga group as compared to the wait-list group at the end of 3 months. There were no significant changes in anxiety and depression scores in caregivers, or psychopathology scores in patients. CONCLUSION: In caregivers of outpatients with functional psychosis, 4 weeks of training followed by 3 months of home practice of a yoga module offered significant advantage over waitlist. Yoga can be offered as an intervention for caregivers of patients with severe mental disorders. Methods of providing yoga intervention closer to the community or use of flexible modules at hospitals needs further study.

23462342	Design and methods of a multi-site, multi-behavioral treatment trial for menopausal symptoms: the MsFLASH experience.	BACKGROUND: Behavioral strategies are recommended for menopausal symptoms, but little evidence exists regarding efficacy. PURPOSE: Describe design and methodology of a randomized controlled 3 by 2 factorial trial of yoga, exercise and omega-3 fatty acids. METHODS: Women from three geographic areas with a weekly average of >/=14 hot flashes/night sweats, who met exclusion/inclusion criteria, were randomized to 12weeks of: 1) yoga classes and daily home practice; 2) supervised, facility-based aerobic exercise training; or 3) usual activity. Women in each arm were further randomized to either omega-3 supplement or placebo. Standardized training, on-going monitoring, and site visits were adopted to ensure consistency across sites and fidelity to the intervention. Participant adherence to the intervention protocol was monitored continuously, and retention was actively encouraged by staff. Information on adverse events was systematically collected. RESULTS: Of 7377 women who responded to mass mailings, 355 (4.8%) were randomized; mean age was 54.7 (sd=3.7), 26.2% were African American, 81.7% were post-menopausal, and mean baseline frequency of daily hot flashes/night sweats was 7.6 (sd=3.8). Adherence of >/=80% was 59% for yoga, 77% for exercise training, and 80% for study pills. Final week 12 data were collected from 95.2% CONCLUSIONS: Conducting a multi-site, multi-behavioral randomized trial for menopausal symptoms is challenging but feasible. Benefits included cost-effective study design, centralized recruitment, and methodologic standardization.

23452710	Spiritual care of cancer patients by integrated medicine in urban green space: a pilot study.	BACKGROUND: Psycho-oncological care, including spiritual care, is essential for cancer patients. Integrated medicine, a therapy combining modern western medicine with various kinds of complementary and alternative medicine, can be appropriate for the spiritual care of cancer because of the multidimensional characteristics of the spirituality. In particular, therapies that enable patients to establish a deeper contact with nature, inspire feelings of life and growth of plants, and involve meditation may be useful for spiritual care as well as related aspects such as emotion. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of spiritual care of cancer patients by integrated medicine in a green environment. METHODS: The present study involved 22 cancer patients. Integrated medicine consisted of forest therapy, horticultural therapy, yoga meditation, and support group therapy, and sessions were conducted once a week for 12 weeks. The spirituality (the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual well-being), quality of life (Short Form-36 Health Survey Questionnaire), fatigue (Cancer Fatigue Scale), psychological state (Profile of Mood States, short form, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and natural killer cell activity were assessed before and after intervention. RESULTS: In Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual well-being, there were significant differences in functional well-being and spiritual well-being pre- and postintervention. This program improved quality of life and reduced cancer-associated fatigue. Furthermore, some aspects of psychological state were improved and natural killer cell activity was increased. CONCLUSIONS: It is indicated that integrated medicine performed in a green environment is potentially useful for the emotional and spiritual well-being of cancer patients.

23450219	The effect of yoga therapy on selected psychological variables among male patients with insomnia.	BACKGROUND: An estimated 30-50% of the general population is affected by insomnia and 10% have chronic insomnia. Yoga therapy is beneficial in such disorders and it has fewer side effects. AIM: The aim of this study was to find out the effect of yoga therapy on selected psychological variables among men with insomnia. METHODS: Forty males with insomnia were divided randomly into 2 groups (the experimental and the control groups). The experimental group received eight weeks of yoga therapy, while the control group did not receive any therapy. The pre and post treatment stress and the self confidence scores were taken. RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in the stress scores and the self confidence scores in the experimental group. There were neither any side effects nor any drop outs. CONCLUSION: We conclude that yoga is an effective treatment option for the patients with insomnia. There are no major side effects.

23449932	Combination of acupuncture and spinal manipulative therapy: management of a 32-year-old patient with chronic tension-type headache and migraine.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this case study is to describe the treatment using acupuncture and spinal manipulation for a patient with a chronic tension-type headache and episodic migraines. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 32-year-old woman presented with headaches of 5 months' duration. She had a history of episodic migraine that began in her teens and had been controlled with medication. She had stopped taking the prescription medications because of gastrointestinal symptoms. A neurologist diagnosed her with mixed headaches, some migrainous and some tension type. Her headaches were chronic, were daily, and fit the International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria of a chronic tension-type headache superimposed with migraine. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: After 5 treatments over a 2-week period (the first using acupuncture only, the next 3 using acupuncture and chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy), her headaches resolved. The patient had no recurrences of headaches in her 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSION: The combination of acupuncture with chiropractic spinal manipulative therapy was a reasonable alternative in treating this patient's chronic tension-type headaches superimposed with migraine.

23448120	Integrative care for pediatric patients with pain.	OBJECTIVES: Although pediatric patients with chronic pain often turn to complementary therapies, little is known about patients who seek academic integrative pediatric care. DESIGN: The study design comprised abstraction of intake forms and physician records from new patients whose primary concern was pain. SETTING/LOCATION: The study setting was an academic pediatric clinic between January 2010 and December 2011. SUBJECTS: Of the 110 new patients, 49 (45%) had a primary concern about headache (20), abdominal pain (18), or musculoskeletal pain (11). RESULTS: The average age was 13+/-4 years, and 37% were male. Patients reported an average pain level of 6+/-3 on a 10-point scale, and most reported more than one kind of pain; parents had an average of 7+/-3 health concerns per child, including fatigue (47%), mood or anxiety (45%), constipation/diarrhea (41%), and/or sleep problems (35%). Most patients (57%) were referred by specialists; 71% were taking prescription medications; and 53% were taking one or more dietary supplements at intake. Of those tested, most (61%) had suboptimal vitamin D levels. All families wanted additional counseling about diet (76%), exercise (66%), sleep (58%), and/or stress management (81%). In addition to encouraging continued medical care (100%) and referral to other medical specialists (16%), frequent advice included continuing or initiating dietary supplements such as vitamins/minerals (80%), omega-3 fatty acids (67%), and probiotics (31%). Stress-reducing recommendations included biofeedback (33%), gratitude journals (16%), and yoga/t'ai chi (8%). Other referrals included acupuncture (24%) and massage (20%). DISCUSSION: Patients who have chronic pain and who present to an integrative clinic frequently have complex conditions and care. They are interested in promoting a healthy lifestyle, reducing stress, and using selected complementary therapies. CONCLUSION: Patients with chronic pain who seek integrative care may benefit from the kind of coordinated, integrated, comprehensive care provided in a medical home.

23440675	Yogic practice and diabetes mellitus in geriatric patients.	BACKGROUND: Stress has negative effect on health and type 2 diabetes patients may be at an increased risk. Abnormally high levels of free radicals and the simultaneous decline of antioxidant defense mechanisms can increase lipid peroxidation and insulin resistance. The objective of the present study was to demonstrate the efficacy of yogic practice in geriatric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and also to compare the efficacy with the state of glycaemic control. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy three (73) healthy elderly patients of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the age group of 60 to 70 years with a history of diabetes for 5 to 10 years and with poor glycaemic control (HbA(1c) >8 %) residing in Kozhikode district were recruited for the study. The subjects were divided into three groups according to their glycaemic control. Group I with HbA(1c) 8.6-9.7 %, group II with HbA(1c) 9.8-10.7 % and group III with HbA(1c) 10.8-12.7 %. Participants did yogic practice under the supervision of experienced trainer, daily 90 minutes and for three months. Biochemical estimation of HbA(1c), glucose, lipid profile, cortisol, ferritin, malondialdehyde (MDA) and catalase activity were carried out on 0 day and 90(th) day. Seventy patients participated in a comparable control session. RESULTS: The participants in the test group showed statistically significant (P < 0.001) decrease in glucose, HbA(1c), lipids, cortisol, ferritin, MDA and significant increase in catalase activity after yogic practice. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga may improve risk profiles induced by stress in geriatric patients with type 2 diabetes and may have promise for the prevention or delay in diabetes complications. And at all stages of the disease a significant improvement can be achieved by yogic practice in geriatric diabetes.	Beena, Rani K;Sreekumaran, E	2013 Jan
23440614	Sudarshan kriya yoga: Breathing for health.	Breathing techniques are regularly recommended for relaxation, stress management, control of psychophysiological states, and to improve organ function. Yogic breathing, defined as a manipulation of breath movement, has been shown to positively affect immune function, autonomic nervous system imbalances, and psychological or stress-related disorders. The aim of this study was to assess and provide a comprehensive review of the physiological mechanisms, the mind-body connection, and the benefits of Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) in a wide range of clinical conditions. Various online databases searched were Medline, Psychinfo, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. All the results were carefully screened and articles on SKY were selected. The references from these articles were checked to find any other potentially relevant articles. SKY, a unique yogic breathing practice, involves several types of cyclical breathing patterns, ranging from slow and calming to rapid and stimulating. There is mounting evidence to suggest that SKY can be a beneficial, low-risk, low-cost adjunct to the treatment of stress, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, stress-related medical illnesses, substance abuse, and rehabilitation of criminal offenders.

23440456	Effect of the integrated approach of yoga therapy on platelet count and uric acid in pregnancy: A multicenter stratified randomized single-blind study.	BACKGROUND: Yoga improves maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnancy. Platelet Count and Uric acid (Ua) are valuable screening measures in high-risk pregnancy. AIM: To examine the effect of yoga on platelet counts and serum Ua in high-risk pregnancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This stratified randomized controlled trial, conducted by S-VYASA University at St. John's Medical College Hospital and Gunasheela Maternity Hospital, recruited 68 women with high-risk pregnancy (30 yoga and 38 controls) in the twelfth week of pregnancy. The inclusion criteria were: Bad obstetrics history, twin pregnancies, maternal age < 20 or > 35 years, obesity (BMI > 30), and genetic history of pregnancy complications. Those with normal pregnancy, anemia (< 10 grams%dl), h/o clotting disorders; renal, hepatic or heart disease; seizure disorder; or structural abnormalities in the pelvis, were excluded. The yoga group practiced simple meditative yoga (three days / week for three months). RESULTS: At baseline, all women had normal platelet counts (> 150x10(9)/L) with a decrease as pregnancy advanced. Ua (normal at baseline) increased in both groups. No one developed abnormal thrombocytopenia or hyperuricemia. Healthy reduction in platelet count (twelfth to twentieth week) occurred in a higher (P < 0.001, Chi(2) test) number of women in the yoga group than the control group. A similar trend was found in uric acid. Significantly lesser number of women in the yoga group (n = 3) developed pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) / pre-eclampsia (PE) than those in the control group (n = 12), with absolute risk reduction (ARR) by 21%. CONCLUSION: Antenatal integrated yoga from the twelfth week is safe and effective in promoting a healthy progression of platelets and uric acid in women with high-risk pregnancy, pointing to healthy hemodilution and better physiological adaptation.

23440311	Effect of yoga exercise therapy on oxidative stress indicators with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.	BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress promotes endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis in chronic renal disease. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the impact of Hatha yoga on oxidative stress indicators and oxidant status, in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. DESIGN: This prospective randomized study consisted of 33 ESRD patients in the Hatha yoga exercise group who were matched with 35 ESRD patients in the control group. OUTCOME MEASURES: The oxidative stress indicators (malondialdehyde - MDA, protein oxidation - POX, phospholipase A2 - PLA2 activity) and the oxidative status (superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities) were determined in the blood samples taken at the pre-hemodialysis treatment, at baseline (0 months) and after four months. RESULTS: In patients in the Hatha yoga exercise group, lipid peroxidation, as indicated by MDA decreased by 4.0% after four months (P = 0.096). There was also a significant reduction in the activity of PLA from 2.68 +/- 0.02 IU / L to 2.34 IU / L (- 12.7%; P = 0.010) and POX from 2.28 +/- 0.02 nmol / mg to 2.22 +/- 0.01 nmol / mg (- 22.6%; P = 0.0001). The activity of SOD significantly increased from 12.91 +/- 0.17 U / L to 13.54 +/- 0.15 U / L (4.65%; P = 0.0001) and catalase from 79.83 +/- 0.63 U / L to 80.54 +/- 0.80 U / L (0.90%; P = 0.0001). There was a significant correlation between the pre-hemodialysis oxidative stress parameters at the zero month and after four months for the activities of PLA (r = 0.440), catalase (r = 0.872), and SOD (r = 0.775). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the Hatha yoga exercise has therapeutic, preventative, and protective effects in ESRD subjects, by decreasing oxidative stress.

23440267	Voluntary heart rate reduction following yoga using different strategies.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: One month of yoga training has been shown to reduce the pulse rate voluntarily without using external cues. Hence, the present study was designed to understand the strategies used by yoga practitioners and autonomic changes associated with voluntary heart rate reduction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty volunteers (group mean age +/- S.D., 25.4 +/- 4.8 years; 25 males) were assessed in two trials on separate days. Each trial was for 12 minutes, with a 'pre' state and 'during' state of 6 minutes each. For both trials the 'pre' state was relaxation with eyes closed. In the 'during' state of Trial I, subjects were asked to voluntarily reduce their heart rate using a strategy of their choice. From their responses to specific questions it was determined that 22 out of 50 persons used breath regulation as a strategy. Hence, in the 'during' state of Trial II, subjects were asked to voluntarily reduce their heart rate by breath regulation. RESULTS: In the first trial, the heart rate was reduced by an average of 19.6 beats per minute and in the second trial (with breath regulation exclusively) an average decrease of 22.2 beats per minute was achieved. CONCLUSIONS: Hence, the strategy used did not markedly alter the outcome.	Raghavendra, Br;Telles, S;Manjunath, Nk;Deepak, Kk;Naveen, Kv;Subramanya, P	2013 Jan
23440089	Comparison of lymphocyte apoptotic index and qualitative DNA damage in yoga practitioners and breast cancer patients: A pilot study.	BACKGROUND: Yoga is found to be effective in reducing stress levels and radiation-induced DNA damage, and improving the quality of life, in breast cancer patients. The present study was aimed at comparing the apoptotic index (AI) and DNA damage of advanced yoga practitioners with those of breast cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional pilot study compared three groups (n = 9 each) of age-matched subjects viz. (1) Carcinoma breast patients in stage II or III undergoing radiation therapy after completing three cycles of chemotherapy; (2) Senior yoga practitioners who were practicing asanas, pranayama and meditation daily for more than 10 years; and (3) Normal healthy volunteers. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated, and qualitative DNA damage (QDD) and AI were evaluated by single-cell gel electrophoresis assay. Approximately 500 cells were counted in each case. Number of cells that were normal, undergoing apoptosis, and with DNA damage were categorized and percentages were calculated. RESULTS: Data being normally distributed, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant interaction between groups in AI (P = 0.016) and QDD (P = 0.045). On post-hoc analysis using Scheffe test, AI was significantly lower in non-yoga volunteers as compared with the breast cancer group (P = 0.019) and QDD was significantly lower in yoga practitioners when compared with non-yoga volunteers (P = 0.047). CONCLUSION: Cellular dysfunction (QDD) requires restorative mechanisms (AI) to restore the system to a balance. The results of this pilot study show trends, which indicate that in ill-health, there is inadequate restorative mechanisms (AI) although dysfunction (QDD) is high. Through regular practice of yoga, cellular dysfunction can be lowered, thus necessitating reduced restorative mechanisms. AI and QDD could also be useful indicators for predicting the three zones of health viz. disease, health, and positive health.

23440029	Yoga experience as a predictor of psychological wellness in women over 45 years.	BACKGROUND: Although high levels of subjective well-being (SWB) are common in old age, a subset of older individuals is disproportionately vulnerable to negative affect. Yoga has been shown to have many short-term benefits, but researchers have not determined whether a long-term or frequent yoga practice increasingly protects older women from low levels of psychological well-being. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which psychological attitudes, transcendence, mental mastery, and subjective vitality in a sample of female yoga practitioners over 45 years varied according to the length and frequency of yoga practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We administered online surveys to a non-probability sample of 211 female yoga practitioners 45 to 80. We used weighted least squares regression analyses to evaluate the relationship of extent of yoga experience to the outcome variables after accounting for age and lifestyle factors. RESULTS: Participants had practiced yoga for as long as 50 years and for up to 28 h per week. There were significant positive relationships between yoga experience and all outcome variables. These significant relationships remained after accounting for age and lifestyle factors. When we computed yoga experience in terms of total calendar years, without accounting for hours of practice, significant relationships did not remain. Transcendence of the ordinary was the most strongly associated with current yoga practice frequency, and positive psychological attitudes were the most strongly associated with total lifetime hours of practice. CONCLUSIONS: Among a non-probability sample of female yoga practitioners between 45 and 80 years, increased yoga experience predicted increased levels of psychological well-being. Results showed a dose-response effect, with yoga experience exercising an increasingly protective effect against low levels of SWB and vitality.

23439856	Effects of yoga on functional capacity and well being.	Yoga has proven beneficial effects on various health domains including musculoskeletal conditions, cardiopulmonary conditions through the practice of asana and pranayamas as well as on mental health, as it is known to enhance the body-and mind coordination. There is paucity of data on the effect of yoga on functional capacity in literature using 6 min walk test. The present study aims to look at the effect of yoga on 6-min walked distance, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), recovery time following the walk and state of well being. This is a hospital-based longitudinal study where 30 physiotherapy students of the age group 18 - 22 years of either sex were enrolled. Subjects having musculoskeletal problems, cardio respiratory disease and those who were not willing to volunteer were excluded They received Yoga intervention in form of Yogic practices which included a combination of asanas, pranayamas and omkar chanting for 1 h for 30 sessions. A baseline 6-min walk test was conducted on subjects and the 6-min walked distance, rating of perceived exertion (RPE) on modified Borg's scale were recorded. The baseline state of well-being was noted using the Warwick- Edinburgh mental well-being scale and similar recording was done post intervention after 30 sessions. Of the 30 subjects, there were no drop outs as these were committed college students. Of them, 24 were females and 6 were males with a mean age of 21.5 years SD 2.38. Statistically significant improvements were observed in 6-min walk distance (P value = 0.000), RPE (P value < 0.000), recovery time (P value < 0.000) and sense of well being score (P value < 0.000). Yoga practices are beneficial in improving the functional capacity in young healthy adults. Yoga can very well be incorporated in medical practice for increasing the patient's functional capacity, for those who have limitations in performing aerobic training due to various health reasons. The improved state of well being motivates the patients to adhere to yogic practices.	Akhtar, Pooja;Yardi, Sujata;Akhtar, Murtaza	2013 Jan
23439799	A preliminary clinical evaluation of external snehan and asanas in the patients of sciatica.	UNLABELLED: Lower back pain radiating to either on one leg or both legs along the course of sciatic nerve is a common ailment in the clinical practice, this type of peculiar symptomatology is termed as "Sciatica" in modern medicine. The medical treatment is unsatisfactory for both the patient and the neurosurgeons, as the surgical treatment has its own hazards and the cost of the surgical procedure and medical treatment is prohibitory to most of the Indian patients. Hence, most of the patients present themselves to the practitioners of Indian medicines like Ayurveda and yoga. This study was designed to evaluate the preliminary clinical effects of Bahya Snehan and Asanas in the patients of sciatica. This was a prospective randomized active control trial. A total of 60 participants showing classical symptoms of Sciatica between 18 and 65 years of age were randomly assigned to receive Ayurvedic or Yogic measure. One group received Snehan (external) with Bhujang and Shalabh Asana while another group received Bhujang and Salabh Asana only. Both groups practiced supervised intervention for 4 weeks. The signs and symptoms like Katishool (pain), tenderness, Stambha (rigidity), difficulty in walking, pain on bending forward were graded and interpreted at the end of the trail Significant improvement was observed in both groups before and after external Snehan with Bhujang and Shalabh Asana and in another group Bhujang and Salabh Asana only. CONCLUSIONS: Both groups, one with Snehan with asanas and the second with asanas only showed significant improvement in the patients of sciatica (Gridhrasi).	Singh, Akhilesh K;Singh, Om P	2013 Jan
23439736	Reducing psychological distress and obesity through Yoga practice.	BACKGROUND: Yoga practice has been effectively prescribed in conjunction with other medical and yogic procedures in the management of severe psychosomatic diseases, including cancer, bronchial asthma, colitis, peptic and ulcer. It improves strength and flexibility, and may help control physiological variables such as blood pressure, lipids, respiration, heart rate, and metabolic rate to improve overall exercise capacity. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of Yogic Practice on anxiety/depression associated with obesity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were recruited from the Department of Physiology, C.S.M. Medical University (erstwhile KGMU), Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. A total of 272 subjects were divided into two groups: 1) group of 205 subjects (with yogic practice) and 2) a control group of 67 subjects (with aerobic exercise). Assessment of anxiety and depression were done by Hamilton Rating Scale. RESULT: This study supports yoga as an effective tool with no diet restriction to improve anxiety and depression symptoms as well as obesity in obese subjects CONCLUSION: Incorporating yogic asana in the treatment protocol of patients suffering from anxiety and depression may prove beneficial in the long run.

23439630	Effects of yoga practice on acumeridian energies: Variance reduction implies benefits for regulation.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This paper concerns mechanisms responsible for the efficacy of yoga medicine, traditionally attributed to the enlivenment of prana. Our strategy was to investigate levels of Qi in acupuncture meridians, since Qi is usually considered equivalent to prana. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electrodermal measurements at acumeridian endpoints (Tsing points) were made on 32 healthy individuals, pre and post 3 weeks yoga lifestyle program using AcuGraph 3 (an instrument in wide use). A previous study found that inherent errors prevent AcuGraph from precisely evaluating Qi energies in single meridians, so group results are reported: (a) Energy levels, (b) energy stability, and (c) energy balance between (i) Yin/Yang meridians, (ii) upper and lower, and (iii) left and right regions of the body. RESULTS: Significant improvements were observed in all but energy stability, supporting the ideas that yoga enlivens prana, and that balance in meridians constitutes health. For balance variables, the study observed shifts toward normal at both ends of variable distributions, reducing standard deviations: post-intervention percentages of subjects with values in the 'healthy' range increased. CONCLUSION: Yoga improved regulation of Qi levels in acumeridian meridians as well as increasing them.	Nagilla, Niharika;Hankey, Alex;Nagendra, Hr	2013 Jan
23439436	The effect of pranayama on test anxiety and test performance.	OBJECTIVES: In an educational setting, anxiety is often experienced by students when taking a test; which is called 'test anxiety'. This study intends to investigate the effect of doing pranayama on test anxiety and test performance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The participants consisted of 107 MA students who were randomly assigned to the control and experimental groups. The students of the experimental group practiced pranayama for one full semester. Sarason's (1980) test anxiety scale was given to both the control and experimental groups in the final session, before taking the examination. RESULTS: After practicing pranayama, only 33% of the participants of the experimental group experienced high test anxiety, while this percentage was nearly twice in the control group (66.7%). Furthermore, the result of the t-test for test anxiety and test performance showed that the students of the experimental group had significantly lower mean test anxiety scores (M = 16.00) as compared to the students of the control group (M = 19.31). Also, the test performance scores of the experimental group were higher when compared with the control group. There was a negative correlation between the final test performance and test anxiety (r = -.204, P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Pranayama seems to have a significant positive effect on test anxiety and test performance. It could be used as an important technique by students prior to their examinations, to reduce their test anxiety and increase their test performance.	Nemati, Azadeh	2013 Jan
23439274	A cost-effectiveness and return-on-investment analysis of a worksite vitality intervention among older hospital workers: results of a randomized controlled trial.	OBJECTIVE: To conduct a cost-effectiveness and return-on-investment analysis comparing a worksite vitality intervention with usual care. METHODS: A total of 730 older hospital workers were randomized to the intervention or control group. The 6-month intervention consisted of yoga and aerobic exercising, coaching, and fruit. At baseline, and 6 and 12 months, general vitality, work-related vitality, and need for recovery were determined. Cost data were collected on a 3-monthly basis. The cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from the societal perspective and the return-on-investment analysis from the employer's perspective using bootstrapping techniques. RESULTS: No significant differences in costs and effects were observed. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in terms of general vitality (range, 0 to 100), work-related vitality (range, 0 to 6), and need for recovery (range, 0 to 100) were, respectively, euro280, euro7506, and euro258 per point improvement. Per euro invested, euro2.21 was lost. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention was neither cost-effective nor cost-saving.	van Dongen, Johanna M;Strijk, Jorien E;Proper, Karin I;van Wier, Marieke F;van Mechelen, Willem;van Tulder, Maurits W;van der Beek, Allard J	2013 Mar
23437686	Integrating messages from the eating disorders field into obesity prevention.	Weight-related problems, including unhealthy weight control behaviors, binge eating, overweight and obesity, and eating disorders, are prevalent in youth. Furthermore, many young people exhibit more than one of these problems. Therefore, it is essential to consider how to simultaneously work toward the prevention of a broad range of weight-related problems in youth. Dieting, body dissatisfaction, weight talk, and weight-related teasing are commonly addressed risk factors within eating disorder prevention interventions, whereas low levels of physical activity and high intakes of foods high in fat and sugar are commonly addressed within interventions aimed at obesity prevention. Empirical data to be presented in this article demonstrate why risk factors such as dieting and body dissatisfaction, which are typically addressed within the eating disorder field, need to also be addressed within the obesity field. Although dieting and body dissatisfaction strongly predict weight gain over time, these findings are not always taken into account in the design of obesity interventions for youth. Possible reasons as to why risk factors such as dieting, body dissatisfaction, and weight stigmatization may be not adequately addressed within interventions addressing obesity are discussed. Suggestions for how physicians and other nonphysician clinicians might link messages from the fields of both eating disorders and obesity into their work with youth are provided. Finally, the potential for work on mindfulness and yoga to decrease risk factors for both eating disorders and obesity are explored.	Neumark-Sztainer, Dianne	2012 Dec

23431341	A randomized controlled trial on the effects of yoga on stress reactivity in 6th grade students.	There is an increasing interest in developing school programs that improve the ability of children to cope with psychosocial stress. Yoga may be an appropriate intervention as it has demonstrated improvements in the ability of children to manage psychosocial stress. Yoga is thought to improve the control of reactivity to stress via the regulation of the autonomic nervous system. The current study examined the effects of yoga compared to a physical education class on physiological response (blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR)) to behavioral stressor tasks (mental arithmetic and mirror tracing tasks). Data analysis of BP and HR was performed using a 2 x 2 x 4 repeated measures ANOVA (time x group x stressor time points). 30 (17 male) 6th graders participated in the study. Yoga did not provide significant differences in stress reactivity compared to a physical education class (group x time: systolic (F(1,28) = .538, P = .470); diastolic (F(1,28) = .1.061, P = .312); HR (F(1,28) = .401, P = .532)). The lack of significant differences may be due to the yoga intervention failing to focus on stress management and/or the stressor tasks not adequately capturing attenuation of stressor response.

23428783	Mind-body medicine for schizophrenia and psychotic disorders: a review of the evidence.	Over half of psychiatric patients use some kind of Complementary and Alternative Medicine, with Mind-Body Medicine (MBM) being the most commonly used collective modality. To date however, to our knowledge, no overarching review exists examining MBM for psychotic disorders. Thus the purpose of this paper is to present the first review in this area. A MEDLINE search was conducted of articles written in English from 1946 up to January 15, 2011 using a range of MBM and psychotic disorder search terms. Human clinical trials and, where available, pertinent meta-analyses and reviews were included in this paper. Forty-two clinical studies and reviews of MBMs were located, revealing varying levels of evidence. All studies included used MBMs as an adjunctive therapy to usual care, including medication. Overall, supportive evidence was found for music therapy, meditation and mindfulness techniques. Some positive studies were found for yoga and breathing exercises, general relaxation training, and holistic multi-modality MBM interventions. Due to insufficient data, a conclusion cannot be reached for hypnosis, thermal or EMG biofeedback, dance or drama therapy, or art therapy. No clinical trials were found for guided imagery, autogenic training, journal writing, or ceremony practices. For many techniques, the quality of research was poor, with many studies having small samples, no randomization, and no adequate control. While the above techniques are likely to be safe and tolerable in this population based on current data, more research is required to decisively assess the validity of applying many MBMs in the mainstream treatment of psychotic disorders.

23428497	A pilot study of yoga for chronic headaches in youth: promise amidst challenges.	The primary aim of the current study was to provide preliminary data on the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of alignment-based yoga for youths with chronic headaches. A secondary aim was to provide preliminary estimates of yoga's ability to improve headache pain, daily functioning, quality of life, and anxiety level in this population. The yoga intervention consisted of 8 weekly, 75-minute classes. Participant flow data revealed challenges to feasibility primarily due to recruitment and retention. Scores on most outcome measures changed in the predicted direction with medium effect sizes found for the functional outcomes. Pain measures did not change significantly. This pilot suggests that yoga for pediatric headaches may be acceptable, as indicated by positive parent and participant ratings of the yoga experience. These preliminary findings suggest that yoga trials for pediatric headaches include both challenges and promise. Recommendations for overcoming challenges include designs that optimize family convenience.

23414206	The eCALM Trial-eTherapy for cancer appLying mindfulness: online mindfulness-based cancer recovery program for underserved individuals living with cancer in Alberta: protocol development for a randomized wait-list controlled clinical trial.	BACKGROUND: Elevated stress can exacerbate cancer symptom severity, and after completion of primary cancer treatments, many individuals continue to have significant distress. Mindfulness-Based Cancer Recovery (MBCR) is an 8-week group psychosocial intervention consisting of training in mindfulness meditation and yoga designed to mitigate stress, pain, and chronic illness. Efficacy research shows face-to-face (F2F) MBCR programs have positive benefits for cancer patients; however barriers exist that impede participation in F2F groups. While online MBCR groups are available to the public, none have been evaluated. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: determine whether underserved patients are willing to participate in and complete an online MBCR program. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: determine whether online MBCR will mirror previous efficacy findings from F2F MBCR groups on patient-reported outcomes. METHOD/DESIGN: The study includes cancer patients in Alberta, exhibiting moderate distress, who do not have access to F2F MBCR. Participants will be randomized to either online MBCR, or waiting for the next available group. An anticipated sample size of 64 participants will complete measures online pre and post treatment or waiting period. Feasibility will be tracked through monitoring numbers eligible and participating through each stage of the protocol. DISCUSSION: 47 have completed/completing the intervention. Data suggest it is possible to conduct a randomized waitlist controlled trial of online MBCR to reach underserved cancer survivors. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials.gov Identifier: NCT01476891.

23407338	Effects of Hatha yoga on stress in middle-aged women.	BACKGROUND: Stress is considered a crucial trigger for physical and mental illness. Stress reduction is a known long-term benefit of regular Hatha yoga practice. The efficacy of a single-session Hatha yoga class on stress reduction is not currently known. PURPOSE: This study investigated the comparative effectiveness of a single 90-minute Hatha yoga class and an 8-week, 90-minute-class-per-week course. METHODS: We used a quasiexperimental design and recruited 63 female community residents in New Taipei City aged 40-60 years. Participants were randomly divided into an experimental group (n = 30) and a control group (n = 33). The experimental group received the 8-week Hatha yoga course. The control group received no intervention. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and heart rate variability (HRV) assessed stress reduction effectiveness. Chi-square, independent t test, paired t test, and generalized estimating equations were used for data analysis. RESULTS: After a single 90-minute class of Hatha yoga, experimental group PSS scores were significantly less than those of the control group (p = .001). Although experimental group HRV (low-frequency norm and high-frequency norm) had improved, these changes were not statistically significant (p = .059). PSS scores for the single 90-minute class and 8-week course did not significantly differ (p = .157) and HRV of statistics is significant (p = .005). Generalized estimating equations analyzed changes in the effectiveness over time of stress reduction (HRV and PSS) after the Hatha yoga intervention. Results showed the postintervention HRV and PSS of the experimental group decreased significantly (p < .001) more than the control group. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Our findings support the position that regular, long-term practice of Hatha yoga provides clear and significant health benefits. Participation in a single 90-minute Hatha yoga class can significantly reduce perceived stress. Doing Hatha yoga regularly can reduce perceived stress even more significantly.

23402226	Perceived health benefits from yoga among breast cancer survivors.	PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to describe the health benefits reported by breast cancer survivors following an 8-week yoga intervention. DESIGN: This phenomenological study employed three focus groups with six breast cancer survivors each (n = 18) following the yoga intervention. SETTING: The focus groups and yoga classes were conducted in a large hospital in a midsized town in the Midwest. SUBJECTS: Eighteen female breast cancer survivors who were at least 9 months posttreatment participated in the focus groups following the 8-week yoga intervention. INTERVENTION: An 8-week yoga intervention designed specifically for this population was led by a yoga therapist. MEASURES: A semistructured interview guide was utilized to guide each focus group. ANALYSIS: Interpretative phenomenological analysis methods were employed to explore breast cancer survivors' experiences after participating in an 8-week yoga intervention. RESULTS: The findings revealed that the women in the study found health promoting benefits in the areas of physical health and healing, mental health and healing, and social health and healing. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga may be an important tool in the healing process for breast cancer survivors.

23400315	Cancer patients' experiences with and perceived outcomes of yoga: results from focus groups.	PURPOSE: Yoga is a "mind-body" exercise, a combination of physical poses with breathing and meditation, and may have beneficial effects on physical and psychosocial symptoms. We aimed to explore cancer patients' motives for practicing yoga, experiences of practicing yoga, and perceived physical and psychosocial outcomes. METHODS: Participants (n = 45) following yoga classes for cancer patients were asked to participate in focus group interviews, of whom 29 participated. The focus groups (n = 5) were audio taped with prior consent and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed by two coders and independently coded into key issues and themes. RESULTS: Mean age of the participants was 53.8 (SD 10.8) years, of whom 25 were women, and 18 were diagnosed with breast cancer. Motives for participation in yoga were relaxation, the will to be physically active, the wish to pay more attention to one's body, coping with psychosocial symptoms, contributing to their cancer rehabilitation process, and combing physical and mental processes. Main physical and psychosocial experiences of yoga mentioned by patients were regaining body awareness, raising attention to the inner self, learning how to relax, enjoyment, and finding recognition and understanding. Increased physical fitness and function, mental strength and resilience, increased coping, being more relaxed, and happiness were frequently mentioned experiences of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with different types of cancer perceived several benefits on physical and psychosocial outcomes by practicing yoga. Therefore, yoga can be a valuable form of supportive care for cancer patients.	van Uden-Kraan, C F;Chinapaw, M J M;Drossaert, C H C;Verdonck-de Leeuw, I M;Buffart, L M	2013 Jul
23398959	Increased heart rate variability but no effect on blood pressure from 8 weeks of hatha yoga - a pilot study.	BACKGROUND: Yoga exercises are known to decrease stress and restore autonomic balance. Yet knowledge about the physiological effects of inversion postures is limited. This study aimed to investigate the effects of inversion postures (head below the heart) on blood pressure (BP) and heart rate variability (HRV). METHODS: Twelve healthy women and men took part in an 8-week yoga program (60 min once a week). BP was measured with an automatic Omron mx3 oscillometric monitoring device and HRV with a Holter 24-hour ECG at baseline and 8 weeks after the intervention. RESULTS: There was no significant effect of inversion postures on BP. Nine out of 12 participants showed a significant increase in HRV (p < 0.05) at night (2 hours) on pNN50% (12.7 +/- 12.5 to 18.2 +/- 13.3). There were no significant changes in other HRV measures such as NN50, LF, HF, LF/HF ratio, LF normalized units (n.u.), HF n.u. and RMSSD. CONCLUSION: Eight weeks of hatha yoga improved HRV significantly which suggests an increased vagal tone and reduced sympathetic activity.

23398359	Community-based postpartum exercise program.	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of an exercise programme for postpartum women to lose weight and relieve fatigue and depression. BACKGROUND: The optimal period for weight loss is six months postpartum. However, most women cannot return to their pre-pregnancy fitness level within that period of time. DESIGN: A quasi-experimental one-group pretest-post-test design was carried out. METHODS: A convenience sampling method was used to recruit 28 women at 2-6 months postpartum. The 'Yoga and Pilates Exercise Programme for Postpartum Woman' was designed for this study and was delivered in group sessions once a week for three months (12 times total) for 60 minutes each time by a professional coach. Of the participants, 23 completed the entire program. The participants' body composition and levels of depression and fatigue were measured before and after the programme to identify differences. RESULTS: Women in the high-score group showed a significant decrease of 6.71 +/- 5.71 points (t = 3.113, p = 0.021) in the depression score after participating in the exercise programme. No significant difference was found for the level of fatigue before and after the exercise programme (p > 0.05). Significant reductions in the participants' body weight, body fat percentage, fat mass and basic metabolic rate were observed after the exercise programme (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These physical activities benefited the physical and mental health of postpartum women and enhanced their quality of life. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is worthwhile promoting a yoga and Pilates exercise programme for postpartum women in communities.

23396262	A gene cluster responsible for biosynthesis of phomenoic acid in the plant pathogenic fungus, Leptosphaeria maculans.	Phomenoic acid, a long chain aliphatic carboxylic acid is a major metabolite produced by Leptosphaeria maculans, a fungal pathogen of Brassica napus (canola). This fungus has 15 predicted polyketide synthases (PKS) and seven of them have the appropriate domains for the biosynthesis of phomenoic acid. The most highly expressed PKS gene after 7 days growth in 10% V8 juice, PKS2, was silenced and the resultant mutant produced very low levels of phomenoic acid, indicating that this PKS is involved in phomenoic acid biosynthesis. This gene is part of a co-regulated cluster of genes. Reduced expression of an adjacent gene encoding the transcriptional regulator C6TF, led to reduced expression of genes for PKS2, P450, a cytochrome P450 monoxygenase, YogA, an alcohol dehydrogenase/quinone reductase, RTA1, a lipid transport exporter superfamily member and MFS, a Major Facilitator Superfamily transporter, as well as a marked reduction in phomenoic acid production. Phomenoic acid is toxic towards another canola pathogen Leptosphaeria biglobosa 'canadensis', but not towards L. maculans and only moderately toxic towards the wheat pathogen Stagonospora nodorum. This molecule is detected in infected stems and stubble of B. napus, but biosynthesis of it does not appear to be essential for pathogenicity of L. maculans. Phomenoic acid may play a role in allowing L. maculans to outcompete other fungi in its environmental niche.

23392363	Measuring cystatin C to determine renal function in neonates.	OBJECTIVES: The incidence of acute kidney injury in neonates is high and associated with up to a 50% mortality rate. The purpose of this review was to determine the feasibility of using serum cystatin C measurements to assist clinicians in making early and accurate diagnoses of acute kidney injury in neonates. DATA SOURCE: We searched for the following seven key words within the PubMed database and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews: cystatin C, neonates, newborn, preterm, premature, kidney failure, and kidney injury. STUDY SELECTION: The selected studies included neonates within their study populations and were published in English. We reviewed literature published between January 1990 and May 2012. DATA EXTRACTION: Ten studies had conducted serum cystatin C measurements in neonates. DATA SYNTHESIS: The cystatin C level in neonates is not influenced by the maternal level and is highest at birth. In most studies, cystatin C levels on day 1 of life ranged between 1 and 2 mg/L, gradually declined during the first year and then remained relatively stable thereafter. Cystatin C levels did not differ between male and female infants, and no significant gestational age-dependent differences were found. Cystatin C levels were increased in cases of sepsis, acute kidney injury, and congenital renal abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Cystatin C has all of the theoretical properties needed to be an ideal marker of renal function. It can be used to determine baseline renal function on day 1 and is increasingly being used to determine renal function in sick neonates. In the majority of studies, the day 1 cystatin C level ranged between 1 and 2 mg/L, which gradually declined in the first year of life. However, the number of available studies evaluating cystatin C in sick neonates is currently limited, and there are also no studies linking cystatin C levels in sick babies with short-term and long-term outcomes.

23387504	Yoga for chronic neck pain: a 12-month follow-up.	OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of a 9-week yoga intervention on chronic nonspecific neck pain 12 months after completion. DESIGN: Twelve-month follow-up of the pooled data of both arms of a randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Department of Internal and Integrative Medicine at an academic teaching hospital. SUBJECTS: Fifty-one patients with chronic nonspecific neck pain (mean age 47.8 years; 82.4% female). INTERVENTIONS: A 9-week yoga group intervention. OUTCOME MEASURES: Neck pain intensity (100-mm visual analog scale), functional disability (neck disability index), health-related quality of life (short-form 36 questionnaire, SF-36), generic disability (days with restricted activities), and global improvement. RESULTS: From baseline to 12-month follow-up, pain intensity improved from 48.81 +/- 17.71 to 32.31 +/- 20.68 (P < 0.001), neck-related disability decreased from 25.26 +/- 9.02 to 19.49 +/- 11.52 (P = 0.001), and bodily pain in the SF-36 improved from 49.37 +/- 12.40 to 59.26 +/- 17.57 (P = 0.005). Improvements in pain intensity were predicted by weekly minutes of yoga practice during the past 4 weeks (r(2) = 0.12, P = 0.028); improved neck-related disability (r(2) = 0.24, P = 0.001) and bodily pain (r(2) = 0.26, P = 0.006) were predicted by regular yoga practice during the past 12 months. Generic disability did not decrease significantly. Twenty-four patients (68.6%) rated their health as at least somewhat improved. CONCLUSIONS: A 9-week yoga intervention improved pain and neck-related disability for at least 12 months after completion. Sustained yoga practice seems to be the most important predictor of long-term effectiveness.	Cramer, Holger;Lauche, Romy;Hohmann, Claudia;Langhorst, Jost;Dobos, Gustav	2013 Apr
23387247	Immediate effect of mukha bhastrika (a bellows type pranayama) on reaction time in mentally challenged adolescents.	Mentally challenged individuals are known to have slower speed of reaction. As a previous study has shown immediate improvement in reaction time (RT) following mukha bhastrika, a bellows type of pranayama, we planned to study the effect of this pranayama in mentally challenged adolescents. 34 mentally challenged adolescents (15.1 +/- 0.806 y) studying in a school for Special Needs were recruited as they have been receiving yoga training once a week for more than 3 years. Exclusion criteria were inability to either perform mukha bhastrika or to understand procedure for testing RT. Visual (VRT) and auditory reaction time (ART) was measured using RT apparatus before and after nine rounds of mukha bhastrika and a control period of ten minutes of normal activities to rule out any test-retest practice effect. Analysis of non-intervention period values showed that the reliability in terms of reproducibility of the observation for both VRT (r = 0.87) and ART (r = 0.95) was excellent. Mukha bhastrika produced an immediate and significant decrease in both VRT and ART. There was a statistically significant decrease in VRT (P < 0.0001) from 296.15ms +/- 13.49 to 263.59ms +/- 12.53 and ART (P < 0.0001) from 247.88 ms +/- 14.33 to 217.35 ms +/- 11.36 following mukha bhastrika. Decrease in RT signifies improved central neuronal processing ability. This may be due to greater arousal and faster rate of information processing, improved concentration and/or ability to ignore or inhibit extraneous stimuli. Mukha bhastrika may be altering afferent inputs from abdominal and thoracic regions, in turn modulating activity at ascending reticular activating system and thalamo-cortical levels. It is suggested that yogic breathing techniques like mukha bhastrika be used as an effective means of improving neuromuscular abilities in special children.

23387245	Effect of Yoga Nidra on physiological variables in patients of menstrual disturbances of reproductive age group.	Aim of this study was to see any effect on autonomic functions in menstrual disturbances patients after Yoga Nidra practice. The subjects for the study were 150 females with menstrual irregularities, 28.08 +/- 7.43 years of mean age, referred from department of Obstetrics and Gynecology CSMMU, UP, Lucknow. Subjects were divided randomly in to two groups' intervention and in control groups -seventy five (75) in each group. Out of these, one hundred twenty six (126) completed the study protocol. The yogic intervention consisted of 35-40 minutes/day, five days in a week till six months. An autonomic function testing was done in both the groups at zero time and after six months. A significant positive effect was observed when yoga therapy was used as an adjunct in the patients of menstrual disturbances. There were significant improvements in the blood pressure, postural hypotension and sustained hand grip, heart rate expiration inspiration ratio and 30:15 beat ratios of the subjects after yogic practice.

23383976	Toward identifying the effects of the specific components of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction on biologic and emotional outcomes among older adults.	OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of specific Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) activities (yoga, sitting and informal meditation, body scan) on immune function, circulating insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 concentrations, and positive affect among older adults. DESIGN: The study design comprised longitudinal analyses of data from subjects in an 8-week MBSR program. SETTING: The study was conducted at a University-affiliated health center. SUBJECTS: This study involved 100 community-dwelling older adults. Inclusion criteria were as follows: >/=65 years of age and English-speaking. INTERVENTION: This was an 8-week MBSR program. OUTCOME MEASURES: Interleukin (IL)-6 and IGF-1 levels were assayed from blood collected at postintervention assessments. Participants were immunized postintervention with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), and immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG KLH-specific antibody responses were measured prior to immunization as well as 3 weeks and 24 weeks postintervention. Participants completed a 10-item measure of positive affect at study entry and postintervention. RESULTS: Participants maintained weekly practice logs documenting participation in yoga, sitting meditation, informal meditation, and body scan. More practice of yoga was associated with higher post-treatment IGF-1 levels and greater improvement in positive affect from study entry to postintervention. Sitting meditation was positively associated with post-treatment IGF-1. Greater use of body scanning was associated with reduced antigen-specific IgM and IgG 3 weeks postintervention but not 24 weeks. No associations were found between MBSR activities and IL-6 levels. CONCLUSIONS: Practice of MBSR activities, particularly yoga, could provide benefits for specific aspects of physiologic function and positive affect. Changes in adaptive immunity in older adult MBSR practitioners warrant further study.

23380323	Regulation of gene expression by yoga, meditation and related practices: a review of recent studies.	Integrative medicine (IM) approaches have gained significant interest in recent years to provide a solution for the health care challenges we face today. Yogic cognitive-behavioral practices are among the most widely used IM approaches and include diverse practices such as yoga asanas, meditation, breathing exercises, Qi Gong, Tai Chi Chih, and various others. Studies to date suggest that these yogic/meditative practices have significant positive effects on the mind-body system and thereby can increase wellness and support the healing process from disease. Previous work has provided evidence for both psychological and physiological effects of these practices; however, the mechanisms of these effects, especially at the molecular level, have largely been missing. Three recent studies started to provide some of this information through gene expression profiling in circulating immune cells, which support the hypothesis that yogic/meditative practices have a measurable effect at the molecular level. These studies are reviewed herein and some future perspectives are considered.	Saatcioglu, Fahri	2013 Feb
23380210	Complementary and alternative medicine consultations in urban and nonurban areas: a national survey of 1427 Australian women.	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate survey data from a national cross-sectional sample of 1427 urban and nonurban Australian women focusing on the relationship between the use of specific complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practitioner types and the levels of CAM use across urban and nonurban areas. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 1427 middle-aged participants from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health conducted in 2009 was performed. The survey was designed to investigate multiple factors affecting the health and well-being of a cohort of women, with a particular emphasis on urban and nonurban residence. Women in 3 age groups ("young" 18-23 years, "mid-age" 45-50 years, and "older" 70-75 years) were randomly selected from the national Medicare database. The survey covered place of residence, measures of health status, rating of health care providers/services, and consultation with CAM practitioners. RESULTS: The most commonly consulted CAM practitioners for this sample were massage therapists (n = 912; 63.9%), doctors of chiropractic/chiropractors (n = 614; 43.0%), and naturopaths/herbal therapists (n = 327; 22.9%). Statistically significant differences between the areas of residence were found for women who used chiropractors (P = .0165), yoga practitioners (P = .0087), and osteopaths (P < .0001). Women residing in nonurban areas were more likely to consult with a chiropractor compared with women residing in major cities. Women in major cities were more likely to consult with a yoga practitioner or osteopath than women from nonurban areas. Women from nonurban areas who consulted a chiropractor were significantly less satisfied with their access to a medical specialist (P < .0001), access to a female general practitioner (P = .043), the number of general practitioners they have to choose from (P = .001), how long they have to wait for an appointment (0.0146), and the amount of information sharing by their general practitioner (P = .003), compared with urban women. CONCLUSIONS: For the population sample studied, the higher overall consultation rates with CAM therapists by Australian nonurban women were caused by consultations for chiropractic care.

23375926	Effect of yoga on arrhythmia burden, anxiety, depression, and quality of life in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: the YOGA My Heart Study.	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of yoga on atrial fibrillation (AF) burden, quality of life (QoL), depression, and anxiety scores. BACKGROUND: Yoga is known to have significant benefit on cardiovascular health. The effect of yoga in reducing AF burden is unknown. METHODS: This single-center, pre-post study enrolled patients with symptomatic paroxysmal AF with an initial 3-month noninterventional observation period followed by twice-weekly 60-min yoga training for next 3 months. AF episodes during the control and study periods as well as SF-36, Zung self-rated anxiety, and Zung self-rated depression scores at baseline, before, and after the study phase were assessed. RESULTS: Yoga training reduced symptomatic AF episodes (3.8 +/- 3 vs. 2.1 +/- 2.6, p < 0.001), symptomatic non-AF episodes (2.9 +/- 3.4 vs. 1.4 +/- 2.0; p < 0.001), asymptomatic AF episodes (0.12 +/- 0.44 vs. 0.04 +/- 0.20; p < 0.001), and depression and anxiety (p < 0.001), and improved the QoL parameters of physical functioning, general health, vitality, social functioning, and mental health domains on SF-36 (p = 0.017, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.019, and p < 0.001, respectively). There was significant decrease in heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure before and after yoga (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with paroxysmal AF, yoga improves symptoms, arrhythmia burden, heart rate, blood pressure, anxiety and depression scores, and several domains of QoL.

23374201	"More than I expected": perceived benefits of yoga practice among older adults at risk for cardiovascular disease.	OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted with participants from trials examining the effects of an Iyengar yoga program on cardiovascular disease risk. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the perceived benefits of yoga in a population of older, predominantly overweight adults participating in a gentle 8-week yoga program. DESIGN: This study used a constructivist-interpretive approach to naturalistic inquiry. SETTING: A total of 42 participants completed the intervention and met the inclusion criteria for the current qualitative study. INTERVENTION: The 8-week Iyengar yoga program included two 90-min yoga classes and five 30-min home sessions per week. Participants completed weekly logs and an exit questionnaire at the end of the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Qualitative data from weekly logs and exit questionnaires were compiled and conventional content analysis performed with the use of ATLAS.ti to facilitate the process. RESULTS: Four broad themes emerged from content analysis: practicing yoga improved overall physical function and capacity (for 83% of participants); practicing yoga reduced stress/anxiety and enhanced calmness (83% of participants); practicing yoga enriched the quality of sleep (21% of participants); and practicing yoga supported efforts toward dietary improvements (14% of participants). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that yoga may have ancillary benefits in terms of improved physical function, enhanced mental/emotional state, enriched sleep quality, and improved lifestyle choices, and may be useful as a health promotion strategy in the prevention and management of chronic disease.

23370082	Impact of iyengar yoga on quality of life in young women with rheumatoid arthritis.	OBJECTIVE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, disabling disease that can greatly compromise health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The aim of this study was to assess the impact of a 6-week twice/week Iyengar yoga program on HRQoL of young adults with RA compared with a usual-care waitlist control group. METHODS: The program was designed to improve the primary outcome of HRQoL including pain and disability and psychological functioning in patients. Assessments were collected pretreatment, posttreatment, and at 2 months after treatment. Weekly ratings of anxiety, depression, pain, and sleep were also recorded. A total of 26 participants completed the intervention (yoga=11; usual-care waitlist=15). All participants were female (mean age=28 y). RESULTS: Overall attrition was low at 15%. On average, women in the yoga group attended 96% of the yoga classes. No adverse events were reported. Relative to the usual-care waitlist, women assigned to the yoga program showed significantly greater improvement on standardized measures of HRQoL, pain disability, general health, mood, fatigue, acceptance of chronic pain, and self-efficacy regarding pain at posttreatment. Almost half of the yoga group reported clinically meaningful symptom improvement. Analysis of the uncontrolled effects and maintenance of treatment effects showed improvements in HRQoL general health, pain disability, and weekly ratings of pain, anxiety, and depression were maintained at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that a brief Iyengar yoga intervention is a feasible and safe adjunctive treatment for young people with RA, leading to HRQoL, pain disability, fatigue, and mood benefits. Moreover, improvements in quality of life, pain disability, and mood persisted at the 2-month follow-up.

23362692	The effect of yoga on neuroticism in an Indian population varies with socio-demographic factors.	Neuroticism, or negative affectivity, can influence a person's approach to life. This study examined levels of neuroticism in 249 patients with illnesses known to be related to the mental state. All of them were given a six-day intensive yoga program. Patients showed a decrease in neuroticism measured by the PGI Health Questionnaire. The reduction was maximum for (a) those with ages between 36 and 51 years, (b) females, (c) patients with at least 17 years of education, and (d) those who were self-employed. The results show the importance of socio-demographic factors in neuroticism levels and in programs intended to reduce neuroticism. Hence, yoga is a useful intervention to reduce traits of neuroticism, with variations in the degree of change based on social factors.

23362559	Measurement pilot study of the Meditative Movement Inventory (MMI).	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mind-body practices that blend physical movement or postures with a focus on the breath and a meditative state to achieve deep states of relaxation have recently been characterized as a category of exercise called meditative movement and include practices such as Yoga, Tai Chi, and Qigong. Critical components of such practices have not been adequately assessed in research, leaving the fidelity of interventions in question; however, there is currently no set of relevant instruments. This article describes the development and preliminary validation of two subscales of the meditative movement inventory (MMI). METHODS: Questionnaire items were generated with input from expert practitioners, and tested in the context of an intervention study (N = 87) comparing Qigong/Tai Chi Easy (QG/TCE) to sham Qigong (SQG). RESULTS: Principal components analysis produced three substantively meaningful factors: breath focus (BF; e.g., "I was using my breathing to go into a relaxed state"; five items, alpha = .86), meditative connection (MC; e.g., "I was connected to something greater than myself"; four items, alpha = .90), and flowing motion (FM; e.g., "I moved in relaxed, fluid movements"; two items, alpha = .61, dropped from further analysis). Confirmatory factor analyses of the first two factors (BF and MC) to examine item reliabilities fit the data well providing positive results for construct composition and item reliabilities. CONCLUSIONS: The BF and MC subscales demonstrated initial strong properties for assessing the presence and strength of these factors in meditative movement intervention studies, whereas additional work is needed to further develop the FM subscale.

23360657	Relaxation breathing improves human glycemic response.	OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated a simple relaxation breathing exercise for acute improvement of postprandial glycemic and insulinemic status. DESIGN: Healthy human subjects were randomized to control breathing (CB; n=13) or a relaxation breathing exercise (RB; n=13) that was repeated every 10 minutes for the 30 minutes before and 90 minutes after consuming a glucose challenge (oral glucose tolerance test; OGTT; 75 g/240 mL). Blood samples were collected before, and 30, 60, and 90 minutes post OGTT for glucose and insulin analysis. RESULTS: Blood glucose at 0 minutes (pre-OGTT), and 30, 60, and 90 minutes post-OGTT with continued RB was 93.7+/-1.9, 136.5+/-8.1, 165.7+/-8.1, and 130.2+/-6.9 mg/dL, and 97.1+/-2.4, 173.1+/-8.4, 158.7+/-11.1, and 137.1+/-10.1 with CB, respectively. RB blood glucose was significantly lower at 30 minutes than CB. Glucose area under the curve (AUC) for CB and RB were not significantly different. Plasma insulin for both CB and RB was significantly increased relative to baseline at 30, 60, and 90 minutes. Insulin values for RB tended to be higher than CB at 30 and 60 minutes, although the difference was not statistically significant. Insulin AUC for CB and RB was not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Relaxation breathing acutely improves the glycemic response of healthy subjects, and breathing pattern could be important for interpretation of glycemic index measurements.

23357337	Determination of peak deflections from human surrogates using chestbands in side impact tests.	To understand the biomechanics of the human body in motor vehicle environments, physical models including anthropomorphic test devices (ATD) and biological models (postmortem human surrogates) are used, and sled tests are conducted. Deflection is often used as a biomechanical variable to characterize the effects of impact loading and derive injury criteria. The objective of the present study was to evaluate different techniques and recommend a methodology to determine the peak thorax and abdominal deflections from temporal contours using chestbands in oblique lateral impacts. The side impact ATD WorldSID representing human surrogates was positioned on a seat. The seat was rigidly fixed to the platform of an acceleration sled. The oblique load-wall fixed to the sled consisted of separate and adjustable plates to contact the shoulder, thorax, abdomen, and pelvis. Two 59-gage chestbands were wrapped on the thorax and abdomen. Tests were conducted at low, medium, and high velocities (3.4, 6.7, and 7.5m/s) and three methods, termed the spine-sternum, bilateral, and spine-box, were used to determine the global peak deflection and its angulation. Results indicated that all three methods produced very similar angulations, for all velocity tests, and at both thorax and abdominal regions. However, maximum deflections were the lowest in the spine-sternum, followed by bilateral and spine-box methods, with one exception. Based on the development of deflection contours, locations used in the definitions of the origin, and accuracy in identifying critical locations/points in time-varying contours, results of the present study indicate that the bilateral method is the optimum procedure to determine the oblique peak deflection vector in biomechanical tests.

23355825	Yoga on our minds: a systematic review of yoga for neuropsychiatric disorders.	BACKGROUND: The demand for clinically efficacious, safe, patient acceptable, and cost-effective forms of treatment for mental illness is growing. Several studies have demonstrated benefit from yoga in specific psychiatric symptoms and a general sense of well-being. OBJECTIVE: To systematically examine the evidence for efficacy of yoga in the treatment of selected major psychiatric disorders. METHODS: Electronic searches of The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the standard bibliographic databases, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO, were performed through April 2011 and an updated in June 2011 using the keywords yoga AND psychiatry OR depression OR anxiety OR schizophrenia OR cognition OR memory OR attention AND randomized controlled trial (RCT). Studies with yoga as the independent variable and one of the above mentioned terms as the dependent variable were included and exclusion criteria were applied. RESULTS: The search yielded a total of 124 trials, of which 16 met rigorous criteria for the final review. Grade B evidence supporting a potential acute benefit for yoga exists in depression (four RCTs), as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy in schizophrenia (three RCTs), in children with ADHD (two RCTs), and Grade C evidence in sleep complaints (three RCTs). RCTs in cognitive disorders and eating disorders yielded conflicting results. No studies looked at primary prevention, relapse prevention, or comparative effectiveness versus pharmacotherapy. CONCLUSION: There is emerging evidence from randomized trials to support popular beliefs about yoga for depression, sleep disorders, and as an augmentation therapy. Limitations of literature include inability to do double-blind studies, multiplicity of comparisons within small studies, and lack of replication. Biomarker and neuroimaging studies, those comparing yoga with standard pharmaco- and psychotherapies, and studies of long-term efficacy are needed to fully translate the promise of yoga for enhancing mental health.

23354530	Nasal saline irrigations for the symptoms of acute and chronic rhinosinusitis.	The use of saline nasal irrigation (SNI) in the treatment of nasal and sinus disorders has its roots in the yoga tradition and homeopathic medicine. In recent years, SNI has been increasingly observed as concomitant therapy for acute (ARS) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Various devices are employed, such as nasal douches, neti pots or sprays. The saline solutions used vary in composition and concentration. This article gives a current overview of literature on the clinical efficacy of SNI in the treatment of ARS and CRS. It then answers frequent questions that arise in daily clinical routine (nasal spray vs. nasal irrigation, saline solution composition and concentration, possible risks for patients). SNI has been an established option in CRS treatment for many years. All large medical associations and the authors of systematic reviews consistently conclude that SNI is a useful addition for treating CRS symptoms. SNI use in ARS therapy, however, is controversial. The results of systematic reviews and medical associations' recommendations show the existing but limited efficacy of SNI in ARS. For clinical practice, nasal douches are recommended-whatever the form of rhinosinusitis-along with isotonic and hypertonic saline solutions in CRS (in ARS to a limited extent). To prevent infections, it is essential to clean the nasal douche thoroughly and use the proper salt concentration (2-3.5 %). Conclusive proof of the efficacy of SNI in the treatment of ARS is still pending. In CRS, SNI is one of the cornerstones of treatment.	Achilles, Nils;Mosges, Ralph	2013 Apr
23350883	Complementary and alternative medicine use among patients with thyroid cancer.	BACKGROUND: To report on the incidence and predictors of use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) among patients with thyroid cancer. METHODS: Data were collected using a web-based online anonymous survey under Institutional Review Board approval from Boston University. This report is based on 1327 responses from subjects with thyroid cancer. Patient factors were compared by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: After excluding multivitamin and prayer use, 74% (n=941) used CAM. Respondents were primarily over age 40, white, and female and held a college degree. The top five modalities were massage therapy, chiropraxy, special diets, herbal tea, and yoga. Few patients reported perceiving a particular modality had a negative effect on treatment. CAM was more often used for treatment of symptoms (73%) than as part of thyroid cancer treatment (27%). Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that patients reporting a poor health status, higher education, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary symptoms, or persistent, recurrent, or metastatic disease were more likely to use CAM for treatment of thyroid cancer symptoms. Nearly one third of respondents reported their CAM use was not known, prescribed, or asked about by their physicians. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison to national surveys of the general U.S. population, patients with thyroid cancer use CAM therapies twice as often and report their use far less often. Physicians who treat patients with thyroid cancer should be aware of these data to further assist in their assessment and care.

23349587	The therapeutic value of yoga in neurological disorders.	BACKGROUND: The ancient mind and body healing methods of yoga recently sparked fervor in the scientific community as an alternative and complementary means of therapy. Since the World Health Organization officially began promoting yoga in developing countries in 1978, yoga has been cited for its therapeutic potential and has been widely recognized in Western culture. However, as an increasing number of people practice yoga for remedial purposes, researchers raise two important questions: 1) Is yoga a valid complementary management and rehabilitation treatment modality? 2) What conditions show promise of treatment with this intervention?. OBJECTIVE: This review article uses comprehensive scientific, evidence-based studies to analyze the efficacy of various basic and applied aspects of yoga in disease prevention and health promotion. It specifically intends to expose the effects of yoga in neurological disorders, particularly epilepsy, stroke, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, peripheral nervous system disease, and fibromyalgia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Information was gathered from various resources including PubMed, Ovid, MD-Consult, USC, and U.C.L.A. libraries. Studies were selected and reviewed on the basis of sample size, control, randomization, double-blinding, and statistical analysis of results. RESULTS: The pratice of yoga and meditation demonstrates statistically encouraging physiological and psychological improvements in the aforementioned neurological disorders. However, there were certain flaws and inadequacies in the study designs employed to evaluate the same. A critical analysis of these studies is presented. CONCLUSIONS: With the aim to focus attention on this widespread yet largely unexamined treatment modality, this paper seeks to provide direction and support for further research necessary to validate yoga as an integrative, alternative, and complementary therapy.

23341425	Arterial blood pressure and cardiovascular responses to yoga practice.	CONTEXT: Yoga is qualitatively different from any other mode of physical activity in that it consists of a unique combination of isometric muscular contractions, stretching exercises, relaxation techniques, and breathing exercises. In particular, yoga postures consist of systemic isometric contractions that are known to elicit marked increases in mean blood pressure that are not observed during dynamic exercise. Stretching can also induce increases in blood pressure and sympathetic nerve activity in the muscles. Currently, not much is known about changes in blood pressure and other cardiovascular responses to yoga practice. OBJECTIVE: The study intended to determine the acute effects of one session of hatha yoga practice on blood pressure and other cardiovascular responses. To gain insight into the long-term effects of yoga practice, both novice (n = 19) and advanced (n = 18) yoga practitioners were studied. DESIGN: The two groups were matched for age, gender, BMI, and blood pressure. SETTING: The setting was a research laboratory at a university. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six apparently healthy, nonobese, sedentary, or recreationally active individuals from the community participated in the study. Intervention The intervention comprised one session of yoga practice, in which participants followed a custom made instructional video providing a yoga routine that consisted of a series of 23 hatha-based yoga postures. OUTCOME MEASURES: Prior to arriving at the laboratory, each participant completed a research health questionnaire, a training-status questionnaire, and a yoga-experience questionnaire. Prior to the yoga practice, each participant's height, body fat percentage, trunk or lumbar flexibility, and arterial stiffness as assessed by carotid femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) were measured. For each posture during the yoga practice, the study continuously measured systolic, mean, and diastolic blood pressures, heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output. RESULTS: Systolic, mean, and diastolic blood pressures increased significantly during the yoga practice. The magnitude of these increases in blood pressure was greatest with standing postures. Heart rate and cardiac output increased significantly during yoga practice, especially with standing postures. Overall, no differences existed in cardiovascular responses between the novice and advanced practitioners throughout the yoga testing session; cfPWV velocity was significantly and inversely associated with lumbar flexion but not with sit-and-reach test scores. CONCLUSIONS: The research team concluded that a variety of hatha yoga postures, especially standing postures, evoked significant increases in blood pressure. The elevation in blood pressure due to yoga practice was associated with increases in cardiac output and heart rate, which are responses similar to those observed in isometric exercise. The lack of obvious differences in blood pressure and other cardiovascular responses between novice and advanced yoga practitioners suggests that long-term yoga practice does not attenuate acute yoga responses.

23337563	Complementary and alternative medicine use among Mauritian women.	OBJECTIVE: To assess CAM usage among women in Mauritius. METHODS: Cross-sectional survey with a nationally-representative sample (n = 384). Quantitative indices included informant-consensus factor, use-value, fidelity-value and use-mentions were calculated. RESULTS: Thirteen therapies were identified and currently are used to treat or manage 26 ailments. These were phytotherapy (30%); yoga (13%); deep-breathing (12%); massage therapy (11%); ayurvedic medicine (8%); meditation (6%); zootherapy (6%); homeopathy (5%); exercise (3%) and reiki (3%). The most prevalent CAM was phytotherapy. Based on the quantitative ethnobotanical indices, plants commonly used were Acalphya spp., (Copper leaf), Curcuma longa (Tumeric), Cymbopogon citratus (Lemon grass), Erythroxylum hypericifolium (Bois ronde), Lens culinaris (Lentil) and Mentha piperita (Mentha). Interestingly, the present study is the first attempt to record CAM management of women's health in Mauritius. CONCLUSIONS: This study can be considered as a primary information resource recording the current use of CAM by women in Mauritius.	Suroowan, Shanoo;Mahomoodally, Fawzi	2013 Feb
23337557	Tai chi/yoga reduces prenatal depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances.	Ninety-two prenatally depressed pregnant women were randomly assigned to a tai chi/yoga or a waitlist control group at an average of 22 weeks gestation. The tai chi/yoga group participated in a 20-min group session per week for 12 weeks. At the end of the treatment period the tai chi/yoga group had lower summary depression (CES-D) scores, as well as lower negative affect and somatic/vegetative symptoms subscale scores on the CES-D, lower anxiety (STAI) scores and lower sleep disturbances scores.

23336342	"I'm more in balance": a qualitative study of yoga for patients with chronic neck pain.	OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the perceived influence of yoga on body perception and psychosocial aspects of life for patients with chronic neck pain. DESIGN: This qualitative study was conducted using semistandardized interviews. SETTING: The interventions and interviews took place in a referral center's research department. SUBJECTS: Eighteen (18) patients with chronic nonspecific neck pain were recruited from a larger randomized controlled trial of yoga for chronic neck pain. INTERVENTIONS: Participants attended 90 minutes of Iyengar yoga once a week for 9 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants completed a drawing of their neck and shoulder regions to reflect their subjective body perceptions before and after their yoga program. Semistandardized interviews were used to explore their body perception, emotional status, everyday life and coping skills, as well as any perceived changes in these dimensions postparticipation. An interdisciplinary group analyzed the study data using content analysis techniques. RESULTS: Participants reported change on five dimensions of human experience: physical, cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and social. Physically, most participants cited renewed body awareness, both during their yoga practice and in their daily lives. Such change was echoed in their postparticipation body drawings. Cognitively, participants reported increased perceived control over their health. Emotionally, they noted greater acceptance of their pain and life burdens. Behaviorally, they described enhanced use of active coping strategies. Finally, socially, they reported renewed participation in an active life. CONCLUSIONS: Participants linked yoga to change on all dimensions of human experience, attributing reduced pain levels, increased coping ability, better pain acceptance and increased control to it. Body awareness appeared a key mechanism in these changes.	Cramer, Holger;Lauche, Romy;Haller, Heidemarie;Langhorst, Jost;Dobos, Gustav;Berger, Bettina	2013 Jun
23334063	Blood pressure and Purdue pegboard scores in individuals with hypertension after alternate nostril breathing, breath awareness, and no intervention.	BACKGROUND: Previously alternate nostril yoga breathing (anuloma-viloma pranayama) was shown to reduce the blood pressure (BP) in people with hypertension. An elevated BP has been associated with poor performance in certain tasks requiring attention and co-ordination. The Purdue pegboard task assesses manual dexterity and eye-hand co-ordination. MATERIAL/METHODS: In the present study there were ninety participants with essential hypertension. Their ages ranged from 20 to 59 years (group average age +/-S.D., 49.7+/-9.5 years; sixty males). Participants were randomized as three groups, with thirty participants in each group. One group practiced alternate nostril yoga breathing for 10 minutes, the second group practiced breath awareness for the same duration and the third group was given a control intervention (i.e., reading a magazine with neutral content). Assessments were taken before and after the interventions for participants of the three groups. Assessments included the blood pressure and performance in the Purdue pegboard task. Data were analyzed with a repeated measures ANOVA and post-hoc analyses were Bonferroni adjusted. RESULTS: Following alternate nostril breathing (ANYB) there was a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (p<0.001 and p<0.05), and an improvement in Purdue pegboard task scores for both hands (p<0.05), and for the right hand (p<.001). Breath awareness (the control session) also showed a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (p<0.05). The right hand scores improved in the group reading a magazine (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the immediate effect of ANYB is to reduce the BP while improving the performing in a task requiring attention, bimanual dexterity and visuo-motor co-ordination.

23330250	Growth hormone treatment in Japan: past, present, and future.	Growth hormone (GH) treatment was approved for growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in Japan in 1975. Since then, GH treatment has been approved for treating five other diseases with short stature. However, available data on adult height after long-term GH treatment is limited to patients with GHD and Turner syndrome. Although adult height of patients with GHD has improved with early diagnosis and early initiation of treatment, the adult height after long-term GH treatment is still not so satisfactory because the therapeutic dose used in Japan is smaller than that used in US and Europe. With early diagnosis, early high-dose treatment, and low-dose estrogen replacement therapy, both adult height and quality of life (QOL) of the patients with Turner syndrome have been improved.

23329568	An oncology mind-body medicine day care clinic: concept and case presentation.	INTRODUCTION: Cancer diagnosis and treatment are often associated with physical and psychosocial impairments. Many cancer patients request complementary and alternative therapies such as mind-body medicine. CONCEPT: The department of internal and integrative medicine at the Essen-Mitte Clinics offer a mind-body medicine day care clinic for cancer patients that is based on the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Program and the mind-body medicine cancer program of the Harvard Mind/Body Medical Institute. The program encompasses mindfulness training, yoga, mindful exercise, nutrition, naturopathic self-help strategies, and cognitive restructuring. CASES: Two patients who had participated in the day care clinic program are presented here. One patient presented with anxiety and depression after recently diagnosed breast cancer and the other with psychological impairments as a result of multiple nevi excision after malignant melanoma surgery. Both patients improved in terms of anxiety and further psychological symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The Essen-Mitte Clinics mind-body medicine day care clinic appears to alleviate psychological consequences of cancer and its treatment. Further studies and randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm these results.	Paul, Anna;Cramer, Holger;Lauche, Romy;Altner, Nils;Langhorst, Jost;Dobos, Gustav J	2013 Nov
23327116	Yoga for schizophrenia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: The aim of this review was to systematically review and meta-analyze the effects of yoga on symptoms of schizophrenia, quality of life, function, and hospitalization in patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: MEDLINE/Pubmed, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, PsycInfo, and IndMED were screened through August 2012. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing yoga to usual care or non-pharmacological interventions were analyzed when they assessed symptoms or quality of life in patients with schizophrenia. Cognitive function, social function, hospitalization, and safety were defined as secondary outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed using the risk of bias tool recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group. Standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. RESULTS: Five RCTs with a total of 337 patients were included; 2 RCTs had low risk of bias. Two RCTs compared yoga to usual care; 1 RCT compared yoga to exercise; and 2 3-arm RCTs compared yoga to usual care and exercise. No evidence was found for short-term effects of yoga compared to usual care on positive symptoms (SMD = -0.58; 95% CI -1.52 to 0.37; P = 0.23), or negative symptoms (SMD = -0.59; 95% CI -1.87 to 0.69; P = 0.36). Moderate evidence was found for short-term effects on quality of life compared to usual care (SMD = 2.28; 95% CI 0.42 to 4.14; P = 0.02). These effects were only present in studies with high risk of bias. No evidence was found for short-term effects on social function (SMD = 1.20; 95% CI -0.78 to 3.18; P = 0.23). Comparing yoga to exercise, no evidence was found for short-term effects on positive symptoms (SMD = -0.35; 95% CI -0.75 to 0.05; P = 0.09), negative symptoms (SMD = -0.28; 95% CI -1.42 to 0.86; P = 0.63), quality of life (SMD = 0.17; 95% CI -0.27 to 0.61; P = 0.45), or social function (SMD = 0.20; 95% CI -0.27 to 0.67; P = 0.41). Only 1 RCT reported adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review found only moderate evidence for short-term effects of yoga on quality of life. As these effects were not clearly distinguishable from bias and safety of the intervention was unclear, no recommendation can be made regarding yoga as a routine intervention for schizophrenia patients.

23326933	[Yoga and meditation: helpful techniques to improve the life of cancer patients].	Cancer is certainly one of the most upsetting things that can happen in a life time, it manages to totally destroy the balance of those affected. The person can suffer from anxiety and fear to such a point that they see their future with terror. These difficulties have a devastating effect on the quality of life of the patient and their families, the latter often being given little consideration by carers. Sometime tailored psychotherapy or medical care can partially contribute only to help the patient and their families-caregiver. Techniques such as Yoga and some structured meditation, e.g. Mindfulness which work on the "feeling" of mind and body can be of help. These techniques lead to a reduction in distress and so add to a better quality of life, fundamental in each stage of the illness.	Nesi, Elisa	2012 Apr-Jun

23322894	Recurrent hamstring muscle injury: applying the limited evidence in the professional football setting with a seven-point programme.	Recurrent hamstring injuries are a major problem in sports such as football. The aim of this paper was to use a clinical example to describe a treatment strategy for the management of recurrent hamstring injuries and examine the evidence for each intervention. A professional footballer sustained five hamstring injuries in a relatively short period of time. The injury was managed successfully with a seven-point programme-biomechanical assessment and correction, neurodynamics, core stability, eccentric strengthening, an overload running programme, injection therapies and stretching/relaxation. The evidence for each of these treatment options is reviewed. It is impossible to be definite about which aspects of the programme contributed to a successful outcome. Only limited evidence is available in most cases; therefore, decisions regarding the use of different treatment modalities must be made by using a combination of clinical experience and research evidence.

23316384	Peer-mediated multimodal intervention program for the treatment of children with ADHD in India: one-year followup.	The objective was to assess the efficacy of a one-year, peer-mediated interventional program consisting of yoga, meditation and play therapy maintained by student volunteers in a school in India. The population consisted of 69 students between the ages of 6 and 11 years, previously identified as having attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A program, known as Climb-Up, was initially embedded in the school twice weekly. Local high school student volunteers were then trained to continue to implement the program weekly over the period of one year. Improvements in ADHD symptoms and academic performance were assessed using Vanderbilt questionnaires completed by both parents and teachers. The performance impairment scores for ADHD students assessed by teachers improved by 6 weeks and were sustained through 12 months in 46 (85%) of the enrolled students. The improvements in their Vanderbilt scores assessed by parents were also seen in 92% (P < 0.0001, Wilcoxon). The Climb-Up program resulted in remarkable improvements in the students' school performances that were sustained throughout the year. These results show promise for a cost-effective program that could easily be implemented in any school.

23305189	Patterns of complementary and alternative medicine use among Turkish cancer patients.	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the tendency to use complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) by patients with cancer in Turkey, and to compare sociodemographic and medical characteristics, perceptions, and quality of life of users and nonusers of CAM. METHODS: A total of 1060 cancer patients were asked to complete a questionnaire about the use of CAM along with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Life Quality Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). Medical information was obtained from hospital chart records. RESULTS: The response rate was 40.1% (425/1060). Use of at least one kind of CAM was identified in 57.4% of the patients. Herbal medications (95%), spiritual/religious affiliations (23.3%), multivitamins/antioxidants (18.4%), and transcendental meditation/yoga (8.6%) were the leading CAM methods. In multivariate analysis, CAM use was found to be associated with age (>60 years) only. Average expenditure on CAMs was 30 U.S. dollars (USD) per patient per month. The most common causes of CAM use were belief in their efficacy (41.3%) and intimate interaction with CAM users (37.2%). Only 41% of the users had informed their doctors that they used CAM. QLQ scores were similar between CAM users and nonusers. Of all participants, 15.5% had psychiatric support. Proportions of regular antidepressant and analgesic use were 16.4%, and 46.3%, respectively. CAM users had worse appetite scores. There was no difference in terms of other scales between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that CAM use is widespread among Turkish cancer patients and CAM use does not improve QLQ scores. Physicians should be aware of high CAM utilization rate in patients with cancer and should better understand the factors directing the patients to such treatments.

23304220	Effectiveness of yoga for menopausal symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.	Objectives. To systematically review and meta-analyze the effectiveness of yoga for menopausal symptoms. Methods. Medline, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO were screened through April 2012. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included if they assessed the effect of yoga on major menopausal symptoms, namely, (1) psychological symptoms, (2) somatic symptoms, (3) vasomotor symptoms, and/or (4) urogenital symptoms. For each outcome, standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Two authors independently assessed risk of bias using the risk of bias tool recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group. Results. Five RCTs with 582 participants were included in the qualitative review, and 4 RCTs with 545 participants were included in the meta-analysis. There was moderate evidence for short-term effects on psychological symptoms (SMD = -0.37; 95% CI -0.67 to -0.07; P = 0.02). No evidence was found for total menopausal symptoms, somatic symptoms, vasomotor symptoms, or urogenital symptoms. Yoga was not associated with serious adverse events. Conclusion. This systematic review found moderate evidence for short-term effectiveness of yoga for psychological symptoms in menopausal women. While more rigorous research is needed to underpin these results, yoga can be preliminarily recommended as an additional intervention for women who suffer from psychological complaints associated with menopause.

23304217	Yoga meditation practitioners exhibit greater gray matter volume and fewer reported cognitive failures: results of a preliminary voxel-based morphometric analysis.	Hatha yoga techniques, including physical postures (asanas), breathing exercises (pranayama), and meditation, involve the practice of mindfulness. In turn, yoga meditation practices may induce the state of mindfulness, which, when evoked recurrently through repeated practice, may accrue into trait or dispositional mindfulness. Putatively, these changes may be mediated by experience-dependent neuroplastic changes. Though prior studies have identified differences in gray matter volume (GMV) between long-term mindfulness practitioners and controls, no studies to date have reported on whether yoga meditation is associated with GMV differences. The present study investigated GMV differences between yoga meditation practitioners (YMP) and a matched control group (CG). The YMP group exhibited greater GM volume in frontal, limbic, temporal, occipital, and cerebellar regions; whereas the CG had no greater regional greater GMV. In addition, the YMP group reported significantly fewer cognitive failures on the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ), the magnitude of which was positively correlated with GMV in numerous regions identified in the primary analysis. Lastly, GMV was positively correlated with the duration of yoga practice. Results from this preliminary study suggest that hatha yoga practice may be associated with the promotion of neuroplastic changes in executive brain systems, which may confer therapeutic benefits that accrue with repeated practice.

23302513	The biomechanical demands of standing yoga poses in seniors: The Yoga empowers seniors study (YESS).	BACKGROUND: The number of older adults participating in yoga has increased dramatically in recent years; yet, the physical demands associated with yoga performance have not been reported. The primary aim of the Yoga Empowers Seniors Study (YESS) was to use biomechanical methods to quantify the physical demands associated with the performance of 7 commonly-practiced standing yoga poses in older adults. METHODS: 20 ambulatory older adults (70.7+-3.8 yrs) attended 2 weekly 60-minute Hatha yoga classes for 32 weeks. The lower-extremity net joint moments of force (JMOFs), were obtained during the performance of the following poses: Chair, Wall Plank, Tree, Warrior II, Side Stretch, Crescent, and One-Legged Balance. Repeated-measure ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc tests were used to identify differences in JMOFs among the poses. Electromyographic analysis was used to support the JMOF findings. RESULTS: There was a significant main effect for pose, at the ankle, knee and hip, in the frontal and sagittal planes (p=0.00-0.03). The Crescent, Chair, Warrior II, and One-legged Balance poses generated the greatest average support moments. Side Stretch generated the greatest average hip extensor and knee flexor JMOFs. Crescent placed the highest demands on the hip flexors and knee extensors. All of the poses produced ankle plantar-flexor JMOFs. In the frontal plane, the Tree generated the greatest average hip and knee abductor JMOFs; whereas Warrior II generated the greatest average hip and knee adductor JMOFs. Warrior II and One-legged Balance induced the largest average ankle evertor and invertor JMOFs, respectively. The electromyographic findings were consistent with the JMOF results. CONCLUSIONS: Musculoskeletal demand varied significantly across the different poses. These findings may be used to guide the design of evidence-based yoga interventions that address individual-specific training and rehabilitation goals in seniors.

23300142	Yoga for functional ability, pain and psychosocial outcomes in musculoskeletal conditions: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVES: Musculoskeletal conditions (MSCs) are the leading cause of disability and chronic pain in the developed world, impacting both functional ability and psychosocial health. The current review investigates the effectiveness of yoga on primary outcomes of functional ability, pain and psychosocial outcomes across a range of MSCs. METHODS: A comprehensive search of 20 databases was conducted for full-text, randomized controlled trials of yoga in clinically diagnosed MSCs. RESULT: Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria, involving 1,626 participants with low back pain (LBP), osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), kyphosis or fibromyalgia. Studies were quality rated, and analysed for the effect of yoga on primary outcomes, immediately post-intervention. Twelve studies were rated as good quality. Yoga interventions resulted in a clinically significant improvement in functional outcomes in mild-to-moderate LBP and fibromyalgia, and showed a trend to improvement in kyphosis. Yoga significantly improved pain in OA, RA and mild-to-severe LBP. Psychosocial outcomes were significantly improved in mild-to-moderate LBP and OA. Meta-analysis of good-quality studies showed a moderate treatment effect for yoga of -0.64 (95%CI -0.89 to -0.39) for functional outcomes and -0.61 (95%CI -0.97 to -0.26) for pain outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that yoga is an acceptable and safe intervention, which may result in clinically relevant improvements in pain and functional outcomes associated with a range of MSCs. Future analysis of outcomes which take into account the amount of yoga received by participants may provide insight into any putative duration or dosage effects of yoga interventions for MSCs.

23294820	Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of a pilot integrative coping and resiliency program for healthcare professionals.	Stress, fatigue, and burnout are common maladies among healthcare employees. To address this problem, a holistic integrative self-care program for healthcare practitioners was designed, implemented, and evaluated. A total of 84 participants, recruited via presentations, flyers, and word of mouth, completed the 8-week program. The experiential course, entitled Healing Pathways, combined training in Reiki, guided imagery, yoga, toning, meditation, intuitive scanning, creative expression, and mentorship to foster more empowered and resilient individuals. We measured the effectiveness of the program via mixed methods consisting of qualitative interviews providing in-depth feedback and quantitative analysis demonstrating statistically significant benefit. Participants reported significantly lower levels of stress and significantly increased confidence in their ability to cope at treatment conclusion (8 weeks) and long-term follow-up (12 months). These findings suggest that an integrative wellness and resiliency program, coupled with individual mentorship, may improve coping, decrease stress, and improve functioning and well-being for nurses and other health care providers.

23294681	An assessment of a sequence of yoga exercises to patients with arterial hypertension.	This quasi-experimental study describes the effects of a yoga sequence following hemodynamic and biochemical parameters in patients with hypertension. Thirty-three volunteers participated in the study (control = 16 and yoga = 17) for four months. Blood pressure measurements, cardiac and respiratory rate were collected monthly, while the biochemical profile was taken at the beginning and end of the program. To analyze the data, Student's t test and repeated measures analyses were performed. The yoga group showed a significant reduction of systolic blood pressure, heart and respiratory rate (p < 0.05). As for the biochemical profile, the yoga group showed correlation coefficients between initial values and final responses greater than the control of fasting glucose, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides. The elaborated sequence practice promoted significant cardiovascular and metabolic benefits. The yoga exercises performed in the proposed sequence constitute complementary non-pharmacological control of blood pressure in patients with hypertension.

23291603	Implementing a global integrative rehabilitation medicine rotation: a physical medicine and rehabilitation residency program's experience.	An innovative international rotation in integrative rehabilitation medicine was implemented as part of the physical medicine and rehabilitation residency program at the Medical College of Wisconsin. Rotation objectives were to introduce medical knowledge of integrative medicine treatments into physical medicine and rehabilitation practice and to initiate collaboration with international academic partners. Residents were approved based on their academic record, completion of prerequisites, and personal statement. During a 4-wk rotation located in Italy, residents developed an integrative treatment strategy for each patient using conventional medical care and other therapeutic options, including acupuncture, biofeedback, aquatic therapy, yoga, and others. Postrotation assessment included evaluations by Italian team and patients, residents' evidence-based presentations, and postrotation self-reflection. Participating residents reported high achievement in clinical performance, improved application of integrative medicine, broader appreciation of cultural diversity in patient care, and increased personal and professional development. This reciprocal program model serves as an example for other programs interested in implementing similar international rotations.

23284211	Ancient science of yogic life for academic excellence in university students.	BACKGROUND: Academic excellence is essential to provide opportunities for students to work together to improve their understanding of concepts in their academic core. Academic excellence helps students to teach problem-solving and collaborative learning strategies. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess Guna (personality traits) in students undergoing Yoga Instructor's Course (YIC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In all, 68 YIC students with a mean age of 28.03 +/- 9.38 years participated in this single group pre-post study. The Personality Inventory data were collected before (pre) and after (post) the YIC. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Means, standard deviations, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and Wilcoxon signed rank test were used for analyzing the data with the help of SPSS 16. RESULTS: The data analysis showed 11.33% decrease (P < 0.01) in Tamas Guna (dull personality trait), 0.68% decrease (P =0.819) in Rajas Guna (violent personality trait), and 10.34% increase (P <0.01) in Sattva Guna (balanced personality trait) scores. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that YIC can result in the improvement of Sattva Guna (balance personality trait) among students, thus paving the way for their academic excellence.

23282113	Effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction on sleep quality: results of a randomized trial among Danish breast cancer patients.	UNLABELLED: The prevalence of sleep disturbance is high among cancer patients, and the sleep problems tend to last for years after the end of treatment. As part of a large randomized controlled clinical trial (the MICA trial, NCT00990977) of the effect of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on psychological and somatic symptoms among breast cancer patients, the aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of MBSR on the secondary outcome, 'sleep quality'. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 336 women operated on for breast cancer stage I-III 3-18 months previously were randomized to MBSR (n = 168) or treatment as usual (n = 168); both groups received standard clinical care. The intervention consisted of an eight-week MBSR program (psycho-education, meditation and gentle yoga). Sleep quality was assessed on the Medical Outcome Study sleep scale at baseline, after the intervention and at six- and 12-months' follow-up. RESULTS: The mean sleep problem scores were significantly lower in the MBSR group than in controls immediately after the intervention. Quantile regression analyses showed that the effect was statistically significant only for the participants represented by the lower percentile of change between baseline and post-intervention, i.e. those who had more sleep problems; the MBSR group had a significantly smaller increase in sleep problems than the control group. After the 12-month follow-up, there was no significant between-group effect of MBSR on sleep quality in intention-to-treat analyses. CONCLUSION: MBSR had a statistically significant effect on sleep quality just after the intervention but no long-term effect among breast cancer patients. Future trials in which participation is restricted to patients with significant sleep problems are recommended for evaluating the effect of MBSR on sleep quality.

27293499	Validity of Borg Ratings of Perceived Exertion During Active Video Game Play.	During physically interactive video game play (e.g., Nintendo Wii), users are exposed to potential distracters (e.g., video, music), which may decrease their ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) throughout game play. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the association between RPE scores and heart rate while playing the Nintendo Wii. Healthy adults (N = 13, 53.5 +/- 5.4 years old) participated in two exercise sessions using the Nintendo Wii Fit Plus. During each session participants played a five-minute warm-up game (Basic Run), two separate Wii Fit Plus games (Yoga, Strength Training, Aerobics or Balance Training) for fifteen minutes each, and then a five-minute cool down game (Basic Run). Borg RPE and heart rate were assessed during the final 30 seconds of the warm up and cool down, as well during the final 30 seconds of play for each Wii Fit Plus game. Correlation analysis combining data from both exercise sessions indicated a moderate positive relationship between heart rate and RPE (r = 0.32). Mixed-effects model regression analyses demonstrated that RPE scores were significantly associated with heart rate (p < 0.001). The average percentage of age-predicted heart rate maximum achieved (58 +/- 6%) was significantly greater (p = 0.001) than the percentage of maximum RPE indicated (43 +/- 11%). Borg RPE scores were positively associated with heart rate in adults during exercise sessions using the Wii Fit Plus. However, this relationship was lower than observed in past research assessing RPE validity during different modes of exercise (e.g. walking, running) without distracters.

23270319	Efficacy of an eight-week yoga intervention on symptoms of restless legs syndrome (RLS): a pilot study.	BACKGROUND: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common and highly burdensome sleep disorder. While relaxation therapies, including yoga, are often recommended for RLS management, rigorous supporting research is sparse. The goal of this preliminary study was to assess the effects of yoga on RLS symptoms and related outcomes in women with RLS. METHODS: Participants were 13 nonsmoking women with moderate to severe RLS, who did not have diabetes, sleep apnea, or other serious concomitant chronic conditions, and who were not pregnant. The intervention was a gentle, 8-week Iyengar yoga program. Core outcomes assessed pre- and post-treatment were RLS symptoms and symptom severity (International RLS Scale [IRLS] and RLS ordinal scale), sleep quality (Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale), mood (Profile of Mood States), and perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale). Participants also completed yoga logs and a brief exit questionnaire regarding their experience with the study. RESULTS: Ten (10) women, aged 32-66 years, completed the study. Participants attended an average 13.4+/-0.5 (of 16 possible) classes, and completed a mean of 4.1+/-0.3 (of 5 possible) homework sessions/week. At follow-up, participants demonstrated striking reductions in RLS symptoms and symptom severity, with symptoms decreasing to minimal/mild in all but 1 woman and no participant scoring in the severe range by week 8. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) were large: 1.6 for IRLS total, and 2.2 for RLS ordinal scale. IRLS scores declined significantly with increasing minutes of homework practice per session (r=0.70, p=0.025) and total homework minutes (r=0.64, p<0.05), suggesting a possible dose-response relation. Participants also showed significant improvements in sleep, perceived stress, and mood (all p's</=0.02), with effect sizes ranging from 1.0 to 1.6. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings suggest that yoga may be effective in attenuating RLS symptoms and symptom severity, reducing perceived stress, and improving sleep and mood in women with RLS.

23265707	Mindfulness significantly reduces self-reported levels of anxiety and depression: results of a randomised controlled trial among 336 Danish women treated for stage I-III breast cancer.	INTRODUCTION: As the incidence of and survival from breast cancer continue to raise, interventions to reduce anxiety and depression before, during and after treatment are needed. Previous studies have reported positive effects of a structured 8-week group mindfulness-based stress reduction program (MBSR) among patients with cancer and other conditions. PURPOSE: To test the effect of such a programme on anxiety and depression among women with breast cancer in a population-based randomised controlled study. METHODS: A total of 336 women who had been operated on for breast cancer (stage I-III) were randomised to usual care or MBSR+usual care. Questionnaires including the Symptom Checklist-90r anxiety and depression subscales and the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale were administered before randomisation and immediately, 6 and 12 months after the intervention. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses showed differences between groups in levels of anxiety (p=0.0002) and depression (SCL-90r, p<0.0001; CES-D, p=0.0367) after 12 months. Graphical comparisons of participants with higher levels of anxiety and depression at baseline showed a significantly greater decrease in the intervention group throughout follow-up and no differences among least affected participants. Medium-to-large effects were found for all outcomes in the intervention group in analyses of change scores after 12 months' follow-up. CONCLUSION: The 8-week group based MBSR intervention had clinically meaningful, statistically significant effects on depression and anxiety after 12 months' follow-up, and medium-to-large effect sizes. Our findings support the dissemination of MBSR among women with breast cancer. (Clintrials.gov No.: NCT00990977).

23249655	Randomized-controlled trial comparing yoga and home-based exercise for chronic neck pain.	OBJECTIVES: Chronic neck pain is a significant public health problem with only very few evidence-based treatment options. There is growing evidence for the effectiveness of yoga for relieving musculoskeletal disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Iyengar yoga compared with exercise on chronic nonspecific neck pain. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to either yoga or exercise. The yoga group attended a 9-week yoga course and the exercise group received a self-care manual on home-based exercises for neck pain relief. The main outcome measure was the present neck pain intensity (100 mm visual analog scale). Secondary outcome measures included functional disability (Neck Disability Index), pain at motion (visual analog scale), health-related quality of life (Short Form-36 questionnaire), cervical range of motion, proprioceptive acuity, and pressure pain threshold. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients (mean age 47.8 y ; 82.4% female) were randomized to yoga (n=25) and exercise (n=26) intervention. After the study period, patients in the yoga group reported significantly less neck pain intensity compared with the exercise group [mean difference: -13.9 mm (95% CI, -26.4 to -1.4), P=0.03]. The yoga group reported less disability and better mental quality of life. Range of motion and proprioceptive acuity were improved and the pressure pain threshold was elevated in the yoga group. DISCUSSION: Yoga was more effective in relieving chronic nonspecific neck pain than a home-based exercise program. Yoga reduced neck pain intensity and disability and improved health-related quality of life. Moreover, yoga seems to influence the functional status of neck muscles, as indicated by improvement of physiological measures of neck pain.

23246998	A systematic review and meta-analysis of yoga for low back pain.	OBJECTIVES: To systematically review and meta-analyze the effectiveness of yoga for low back pain. METHODS: MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CAMBASE, and PsycINFO, were screened through January 2012. Randomized controlled trials comparing yoga to control conditions in patients with low back pain were included. Two authors independently assessed risk of bias using the risk of bias tool recommended by the Cochrane Back Review Group. Main outcome measures were pain, back-specific disability, generic disability, health-related quality of life, and global improvement. For each outcome, standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. RESULTS: Ten randomized controlled trials with a total of 967 chronic low back pain patients were included. Eight studies had low risk of bias. There was strong evidence for short-term effects on pain (SMD=-0.48; 95% CI, -0.65 to -0.31; P<0.01), back-specific disability (SMD=-0.59; 95% CI, -0.87 to -0.30; P<0.01), and global improvement (risk ratio=3.27; 95% CI, 1.89-5.66; P<0.01). There was strong evidence for a long-term effect on pain (SMD=-0.33; 95% CI, -0.59 to -0.07; P=0.01) and moderate evidence for a long-term effect on back-specific disability (SMD=-0.35; 95% CI, -0.55 to -0.15; P<0.01). There was no evidence for either short-term or long-term effects on health-related quality of life. Yoga was not associated with serious adverse events. DISCUSSION: This systematic review found strong evidence for short-term effectiveness and moderate evidence for long-term effectiveness of yoga for chronic low back pain in the most important patient-centered outcomes. Yoga can be recommended as an additional therapy to chronic low back pain patients.	Cramer, Holger;Lauche, Romy;Haller, Heidemarie;Dobos, Gustav	2013 May

23243011	Are people who do yoga any better at a motor imagery task than those who do not?	BACKGROUND: Yoga is a popular recreational activity in Western society and there is an abundance of literature suggesting that yoga may be beneficial for people with a chronic pain disorder. Despite consistently positive results in the literature, the mechanisms of effect are unclear. On the grounds that chronic pain is associated with disruptions of brain-grounded maps of the body, a possible mechanism of yoga is to refine these brain-grounded maps. A left/right body part judgement task is an established way of interrogating these brain-grounded maps of the body. OBJECTIVE: To determine if people who do regular yoga practice perform better at a left/right judgement task than people who do not. METHODS: Previously collected, cross-sectional data were used. Using a case-control design, participants who reported taking part in regular yoga were selected against age, gender, neck pain and arm pain-matched controls. Participants viewed 40 photographs of a model with their head turned to the left or right, and were asked to judge the direction of neck rotation. They then completed a left/right-hand judgement task. RESULTS: Of the 1737 participants, 86 of them reported regularly taking part in yoga. From the remaining participants, 86 matched controls were randomly selected from all matched controls. There was no difference between Groups (yoga and no yoga) for either response time (p=0.109) or accuracy (p=0.964). There was a difference between Tasks; people were faster (p<0.001) and more accurate (p=0.001) at making left/right neck rotation judgements than they were at making left/right-hand judgements, regardless of group. CONCLUSIONS: People who do regular yoga perform no differently in a left/right judgement task than people who do not.	Wallwork, Sarah B;Butler, David S;Wilson, Dianne J;Moseley, G Lorimer	2015 Jan
23235676	Yoga for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease.	BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the major cause of early morbidity and mortality in most developed countries. Secondary prevention aims to prevent repeat cardiac events and death in people with established CHD. Lifestyle modifications play an important role in secondary prevention. Yoga has been regarded as a kind of physical activity as well as stress management strategy. Growing evidence suggests the beneficial effects of yoga on various ailments. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of yoga for secondary prevention of mortality, morbidity, and health related quality of life of patients with CHD. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on The Cochrane Library (2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1948 to January 2012), EMBASE (1980 to January 2012), ISI Web of Science for conference proceedings (1970 to January 2012), China Journal Net (CJN) (1994 to March 2012), WanFang Data (1990 to March 2012), and HKInChiP (from 1980). Ongoing studies were identified in the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (April 2012) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (April 2012). No language restrictions were applied. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the influence of yoga practice on CHD outcomes. We included studies that had at least a six months follow-up period. Men and women (aged 18 years and above) with a diagnosis of acute or chronic CHD were included. We included studies with one group practicing a type of yoga compared to the control group receiving either no intervention or interventions other than yoga. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected studies according to the pre-specified inclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or discussion with a third author. MAIN RESULTS: We found no eligible RCTs that met the inclusion criteria of the review and thus we were unable to perform a meta-analysis. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of yoga for secondary prevention in CHD remains uncertain. Large RCTs of high quality are needed.

23226845	Therapeutic efficacy of add-on yogasana intervention in stabilized outpatient schizophrenia: Randomized controlled comparison with exercise and waitlist.	BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is a highly disabling illness. Previous studies have shown yoga to be a feasible add-on therapy in schizophrenia. AIMS: The current study aimed to test the efficacy of yoga as an add-on treatment in outpatients with schizophrenia. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The study done at a tertiary psychiatry center used a single blind randomized controlled design with active control and waitlist groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consenting patients with schizophrenia were randomized into yoga, exercise, or waitlist group. They continued to receive pharmacological therapy that was unchanged during the study. Patients in the yoga or exercise group were offered supervised daily procedures for one month. All patients were assessed by a blind rater at the start of the intervention and at the end of 4 months. RESULTS: Kendall tau, a nonparametric statistical test, showed that significantly more patients in the yoga group improved in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) negative and total PANSS scores as well as social functioning scores compared with the exercise and waitlist group. Odds ratio analysis showed that the likelihood of improvement in yoga group in terms of negative symptoms was about five times greater than either the exercise or waitlist groups. CONCLUSION: In schizophrenia patients with several years of illness and on stabilized pharmacological therapy, one-month training followed by three months of home practices of yoga as an add-on treatment offered significant advantage over exercise or treatment as usual. Yoga holds promise as a complementary intervention in the management of schizophrenia.

23210469	Adiponectin, interleukin-6, and cardiovascular disease risk factors are modified by a short-term yoga-based lifestyle intervention in overweight and obese men.	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a short-term yoga-based lifestyle intervention on risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and markers of inflammation and endothelial function in overweight and obese men. DESIGN: Nonrandomized prospective lifestyle intervention study with pre-post design. SETTING AND LOCATION: Integral Health Clinic, an outpatient facility providing yoga-based lifestyle intervention programs for prevention and management of chronic diseases. SUBJECTS: Overweight and obese men (n=51) were enrolled in the study. Subjects who were physically unable to participate and those participating in other interventions were excluded from the study. INTERVENTION: A pretested intervention program including asanas (physical postures), pranayama (breathing exercises), group discussions, lectures, and individualized advice. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was weight loss, and the secondary outcome measures were clinical and laboratory correlates of CVD risk, levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), adiponectin, and endothelin-1 (ET-1). RESULTS: Men (n=51, body mass index [BMI] 26.26+/-2.42 kg/m(2)) were enrolled and underwent a yoga-based lifestyle intervention for 10 days. Of 51 subjects, 30 completed the study. There was a significant reduction in weight from Baseline to Day 10 (74.60+/-7.98, 72.69+/-8.37 kg, p<0.001, respectively), BMI (26.26+/-2.42, 25.69+/-2.47 kg/m(2), p<0.001, respectively), and systolic BP (121.73+/-11.58, 116.73+/-9.00, p=0.042, respectively). There was a significant reduction in plasma IL-6 from Baseline to Day 10 (median 2.24 vs. 1.26 pg/mL, respectively, p=0.012). There was a significant increase in the plasma adiponectin from Baseline to Day 10 (median 4.95 vs. 6.26 mug/mL, respectively, p=0.014). Plasma ET-1 level remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that even a short-term yoga-based lifestyle intervention may be an important modality to reduce the risk for CVD as indicated by weight loss, reduction in systolic blood pressure, an increase in adiponectin, and decrease in IL-6 in overweight and obese men.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate the impact of the Nintendo((R)) Wii Fit (Nintendo of America, Redmond, WA) on functional and perceived balance measures in an older adult population over a 4- or 8-week program. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five participants (71.60+/-7.79 years old) from a local senior center played Wii Fit (balance games, hula hooping, and yoga) for 30 minutes 2 days per week in either a 4-week (n=16) or 8-week (n=9) program. An additional nine participants served as a control group. These participants were independent, community-dwelling healthy overweight older adults (mean body mass index, 27.19+/-4.99 kg/m(2)). Functional balance measures included the 8-foot time up-and-go, 30-second chair stands, and the Berg Balance Scale and perceived balance were measured using the following scales: Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale, Falls Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Scale. RESULTS: A paired t test showed significant changes pre-post program in the mean scores of chair stands, Berg Balance Scale, and ADL Scale for the 4-week participants. For the 8-week participants, significant differences were seen pre-post-program for the Berg Balance Scale, ABC Scale, and ADL Scale. There were no statistical change in the control group in the Berg Balance, ABC, and ADL Scales. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that Wii Fit playing may be a vehicle for physical activity participation in the older adult population. It is necessary that research on the effects of exergaming on functional and perceived balance in the older adult population must continue.

23186539	Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) providers' views of chronic low back pain patients' expectations of CAM therapies: a qualitative study.	BACKGROUND: Some researchers think that patients with higher expectations for CAM therapies experience better outcomes and that enthusiastic providers can enhance treatment outcomes. This is in contrast to evidence suggesting conventional medical providers often reorient patient expectations to better match what providers believe to be realistic. However, there is a paucity of research on CAM providers' views of their patients' expectations regarding CAM therapy and the role of these expectations in patient outcomes. METHODS: To better understand how CAM providers view and respond to their patients' expectations of a particular therapy, we conducted 32 semi-structured, qualitative interviews with acupuncturists, chiropractors, massage therapists and yoga instructors identified through convenience sampling. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed thematically using Atlas ti version 6.1. RESULTS: CAM providers reported that they attempt to ensure that their patients' expectations are realistic. Providers indicated they manage their patients' expectations in a number of domains- roles and responsibilities of providers and patients, treatment outcomes, timeframe for improvement, and treatment experience. Providers reported that patients' expectations change over time and that they need to continually manage these expectations to enhance patient engagement and satisfaction with treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Providers of four types of CAM therapies viewed patients' expectations as an important component of their experiences with CAM therapy and indicated that they try to align patient expectations with reality. These findings suggest that CAM providers are similar in this respect to conventional medical providers.

23181734	Physical and psychosocial benefits of yoga in cancer patients and survivors, a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.	BACKGROUND: This study aimed to systematically review the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and to conduct a meta-analysis of the effects of yoga on physical and psychosocial outcomes in cancer patients and survivors. METHODS: A systematic literature search in ten databases was conducted in November 2011. Studies were included if they had an RCT design, focused on cancer patients or survivors, included physical postures in the yoga program, compared yoga with a non-exercise or waitlist control group, and evaluated physical and/or psychosocial outcomes. Two researchers independently rated the quality of the included RCTs, and high quality was defined as >50% of the total possible score. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) were calculated for outcomes studied in more than three studies among patients with breast cancer using means and standard deviations of post-test scores of the intervention and control groups. RESULTS: Sixteen publications of 13 RCTs met the inclusion criteria, of which one included patients with lymphomas and the others focused on patients with breast cancer. The median quality score was 67% (range: 22-89%). The included studies evaluated 23 physical and 20 psychosocial outcomes. Of the outcomes studied in more than three studies among patients with breast cancer, we found large reductions in distress, anxiety, and depression (d = -0.69 to -0.75), moderate reductions in fatigue (d = -0.51), moderate increases in general quality of life, emotional function and social function (d = 0.33 to 0.49), and a small increase in functional well-being (d = 0.31). Effects on physical function and sleep were small and not significant. CONCLUSION: Yoga appeared to be a feasible intervention and beneficial effects on several physical and psychosocial symptoms were reported. In patients with breast cancer, effect size on functional well-being was small, and they were moderate to large for psychosocial outcomes.

23175619	An update on mindfulness meditation as a self-help treatment for anxiety and depression.	In recent years, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments have increased in popularity. This is especially true for treatments that are related to exercise and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) in the treatment of both mental and physical illness. MBIs, such as Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), which are derived from ancient Buddhist and Yoga philosophies, have become popular treatments in contemporary psychotherapy. While there is growing evidence that supports the role of these interventions in relapse prevention, little is known about the role that MBIs play in the treatment of acute symptoms of depression and anxiety. Even less is known about the importance of specific components of MBIs (eg, mindfulness meditation [MM]) and the overall impact that these interventions have on the experience or expression of psychological distress. Moreover, few studies have rigorously evaluated the dose-response relationship that is required to effect positive symptom change and the mechanisms of change that are responsible for observed improvements. This review will define meditation and mindfulness, discuss the relationship between stress and health and how MM relates to therapeutically engaging the relaxation response, and review the empirical findings that are related to the efficacy of MM in the treatment of depression and anxiety symptoms. Given the paucity of research that examines the applications of these treatments in clinical populations, the limitations of applying these findings to clinical samples will be mentioned. A brief review of the issues related to the possible mechanisms of change and the dose-response relationship regarding MBIs, particularly MM, will be provided. Finally, limitations of the extant literature and future directions for further exploration of this topic will be offered.	Edenfield, Teresa M;Saeed, Sy Atezaz	2012
23174554	Exercise for patients with osteoporosis: management of vertebral compression fractures and trunk strengthening for fall prevention.	Maintenance of bone health and quality requires mechanical strain, but the mechanical force needs to be within the bone's biomechanical competence. In osteoporosis, compression of vertebral bodies can be insidious. Therefore, absence of pain does not necessarily indicate absence of vertebral microfracture and deformity. Further, patients with previous vertebral fractures are at risk for further vertebral fractures and their associated morbidity. Exercise is a part of the comprehensive management of patients with osteoporosis and has been associated with improvement of quality of life and lowered risk of future fracture. The exercise prescription needs to match the needs of the patient. If exercise is not prescribed properly, then it may have negative consequences. In general, an exercise program, therapeutic or recreational, needs to address flexibility, muscle strength, core stability, cardiovascular fitness, and gait steadiness. As with pharmacotherapy, therapeutic exercises need to be individualized on the basis of musculoskeletal status and an individual's exercise interest. In osteoporosis, axial strength and stability are of primary importance. In particular, a spinal extensor strengthening program should be performed with progressive measured resistance as tolerated. To address falls and fractures, an exercise program should also include balance and lower extremity strength training. Proper dosing of oral cholecalciferol and calcium supplements can enhance the effect of strengthening exercises. Finally, a coordinated approach, such as the Spinal Proprioception Extension Exercise Dynamic (SPEED) program, can improve back extensor strength, the level of physical activity, and locomotion, and reduce back pain and fear and risk of falls.

23137146	Reflections on clinical applications of yoga in voice therapy with MTD.	This paper explores the application of modified yoga techniques, as an adjunct to voice therapy, by a speech pathologist who is also a yoga teacher. Yoga practices, with effects that may be short-term, are not considered a substitute for comprehensive and integrated somatic retraining systems (such as the Alexander Technique or Feldenkrais ATM). However, when yoga is conducted emphasizing kinaesthetic and proprioceptive awareness, the client may achieve an 'awareness state' that facilitates the learning of vocal remediation techniques (for example, by more easily 'tuning in' to the subtle sensations of supralaryngeal deconstriction). Core yoga elements and clinical applications are identified. The potential benefits and considerations when using yoga as an adjunct to the treatment of muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) are explored.

23132904	Exercise in the community for people with multiple sclerosis--a follow-up of people with minimal gait impairment.	BACKGROUND: Although there are many studies evaluating exercise interventions, few studies have evaluated the effect at follow-up. OBJECTIVES: This paper presents follow-up data for participants who completed the exercise interventions in a large randomised controlled trial. METHODS: One hundred twenty-one people with multiple sclerosis (MS) with minimal gait impairment who completed 10 weeks of community-based exercise interventions were evaluated by a blinded assessor 12 weeks after the intervention. The primary outcome measure was the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 version 2 (MSIS-29,v2) physical component. Other outcomes were the MSIS-29 psychological component, the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) and the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) distance. RESULTS: The positive effect on the physical impact of MS was not maintained from baseline to follow-up (-1.6, 95% CI -0.8, 4.0, p=0.189). The psychological impact and the impact of fatigue remained significantly improved (-3.5, 95% CI -6.1, -1.0, p = 0.006 and -4.68, 95% CI -6.9, -2.5, p < 0.001, respectively). There was no time effect for the 6MWT (f = 1.76, p = 0.179) although the trend suggests reversal of the benefits gained from the physiotherapist (PT)- and fitness instructor (FI)-led intervention. CONCLUSION: The maintained benefit on the psychological impact of MS and fatigue may have important personal and socioeconomic consequences; however, it is important to find ways to maintain the physical benefits of exercise over the long term.

23131373	Effect of integrated Yoga on neurogenic bladder dysfunction in patients with multiple sclerosis-A prospective observational case series.	BACKGROUND: Neurogenic bladder dysfunction (NBD) is a common distressful symptom in multiple sclerosis (MS) affecting quality of life. Yoga has been widely used in treating various symptoms of patients with MS. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of integrated Yoga for NBD in patients with MS as an adjunct to standard medical care. DESIGN: This open arm, pre-post study design assessed the outcome measures at base line and after 21 days of integrated Yoga intervention. SETTING: study was conducted at the center for neurological rehabilitation at KWA-Klinik Stift Rottal in Bad Griesbach, Germany. Eleven MS patients with NBD (mean age 46.7+/-11.24 years) with mean duration 17.2 years volunteered to participate in the study. INTERVENTIONS: integrated Yoga which includes preparatory yogic loosening and breathing practices, Nadishuddi pranayama (alternate nostril breathing), moola bandha (anal lock), kapalbhati (rapid nostril breathing) and deep relaxation technique was given for 2h per day for continuous 21 days. OUTCOME MEASURES: ultrasound scanning for post void residual urine volume (PVR), micturition check list (MCL), incontinence impact questionnaire-7 (IIQ-7) andurogenital distress inventory-6 (UDI-6) were used. RESULTS: Paired sample t-test showed significant improvement in post void residual urine (62.34%, p<0.05), scores on micturition frequency checklist (25%, p<0.05), incontinence impact questionnaire-7 (32.77%, p<0.05) and uro-genital distress inventory-6 (26.33%, p<0.05). CONCLUSION: This study points to the safety and effectiveness of integrated Yoga for bladder symptoms as an adjunct to standard care in multiple sclerosis patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction in Germany. Further trails are necessary to confirm these findings.	Patil, N J;Nagaratna, R;Garner, C;Raghuram, N V;Crisan, R	2012 Dec
23128667	Exercise in the community for people with minimal gait impairment due to MS: an assessor-blind randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: While there is an increasing body of evidence supporting the efficacy of exercise in people with multiple sclerosis (MS), additional information on the effectiveness of combining aerobic and resistance training, and yoga is required. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the effectiveness of community exercise interventions for people with MS having minimal gait impairment. METHODS: A multi-centred, block-randomised, assessor-blinded, controlled trial was conducted. Participants were randomised in groups of eight to physiotherapist (PT)-led exercise (n = 80), yoga (n = 77), fitness instructor (FI)-led exercise (n = 86) and they took part in weekly community-based group exercise sessions. Those in the control group were asked not to change of their exercise habits (n = 71). The primary outcome was the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS) 29v2 physical component, measured before and after the 10-week intervention. Secondary outcomes were the MSIS 29v2 psychological component, the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) and the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT). RESULTS: The group x time interaction approached significance for the MSIS-29v2 physical component (f = 2.48, p = 0.061) and MFIS total (f = 2.50, p = 0.06), and it was significant for the MFIS physical subscale (f = 4.23, p = 0.006). All three exercise interventions led to a statistically significant improvement on the MSIS-29 psychological component and both the MFIS total and physical subscales, which were greater than the control (p < 0.05). Only the PT-led and FI-led interventions significantly improved the MSIS-29 physical and 6MWT to levels greater than the control (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for the positive effect of exercise on the physical impact of MS and fatigue. The group nature of the classes may have contributed to the positive effects seen on the psychological impact of MS.	Garrett, M;Hogan, N;Larkin, A;Saunders, J;Jakeman, P;Coote, S	2013 May
23127308	Falls in people with multiple sclerosis who use a walking aid: prevalence, factors, and effect of strength and balance interventions.	OBJECTIVES: To investigate falls prevalence, factors associated with falling, and the effects of balance and strengthening interventions on falls in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS). DESIGN: Baseline and posttreatment data from a randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Community. PARTICIPANTS: People with MS (N=111) who use bilateral support for gait. INTERVENTIONS: Group and one-on-one physiotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Falls prevalence was assessed using retrospective recall. Demographic information was collected, impairments of body function were assessed, and results from the Berg Balance Scale, 6-minute walk test (6MWT), Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 version 2 physical and psychological scores, and the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) were obtained. RESULTS: The prevalence of falls in a 3-month period was 50.5% among participants with MS, of whom 28% had more than 1 fall. Fallers had a greater physical (mean difference, -3.9; P=.048) and psychological (median difference, -4.5; P=.001) impact of MS and a greater impact of fatigue (mean difference, -9.4; P=.002). A logistic regression analysis found that the MFIS score made a unique, significant contribution to the model (odds ratio=1.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.018-1.079), correctly identifying 68% of fallers. A 10-week group physiotherapy intervention significantly reduced both the number of fallers (58.3% before to 22.9% after intervention, P=.005) and the number of falls (63 before to 25 after intervention, P=.001). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of falls is high in this population of persons with MS, and the impact of MS and of fatigue is greater in fallers. Development and evaluation of interventions to reduce falls risk and the transition to faller or multiple faller status are required.	Coote, Susan;Hogan, Neasa;Franklin, Sue	2013 Apr
23125870	Yoga & cancer interventions: a review of the clinical significance of patient reported outcomes for cancer survivors.	Limited research suggests yoga may be a viable gentle physical activity option with a variety of health-related quality of life, psychosocial and symptom management benefits. The purpose of this review was to determine the clinical significance of patient-reported outcomes from yoga interventions conducted with cancer survivors. A total of 25 published yoga intervention studies for cancer survivors from 2004-2011 had patient-reported outcomes, including quality of life, psychosocial or symptom measures. Thirteen of these studies met the necessary criteria to assess clinical significance. Clinical significance for each of the outcomes of interest was examined based on 1 standard error of the measurement, 0.5 standard deviation, and relative comparative effect sizes and their respective confidence intervals. This review describes in detail these patient-reported outcomes, how they were obtained, their relative clinical significance and implications for both clinical and research settings. Overall, clinically significant changes in patient-reported outcomes suggest that yoga interventions hold promise for improving cancer survivors' well-being. This research overview provides new directions for examining how clinical significance can provide a unique context for describing changes in patient-reported outcomes from yoga interventions. Researchers are encouraged to employ indices of clinical significance in the interpretation and discussion of results from yoga studies.

23125507	The ontological status of western science and medicine.	This paper traces the revolutionary changes that have transformed the ontological status of western physics and biology over the last thirty years, so as to show in detail how they have moved towards the perspective of the Vedic sciences. From this it appears that Ayurveda's more holistic approach is no longer in opposition to the views of physics and biology. In physics, experimental verification of phenomena associated with quantum correlations have forced scientists to accept that the macroscopic world is not strongly objective: traditional western scientific ontology stands rejected. One consequence is that the world is not necessarily reductionist i.e. based solely on the properties of its tiniest constituents. In biology, the 1930's discovery of homeostasis has reached a natural climax: the feedback instabilities, identified by Norbert Wiener as inevitably accompanying control processes, are now recognized to be states of optimal regulation, where organisms centre their function. The non-reductive properties of these states clearly distinguish the theory of control from previous physical theories; they now occupy the centre-stage of life. Possibly against expectation, their non-reductive nature makes their physics holistic: western biology seems to have broken free of reductionist physics. When Ayurveda and bioscience are compared in light of these little appreciated advances in fundamental science, the supposed differences between them are vastly reduced - they practically dissolve. Instead of being poles apart, the ontologies of western science and Ayurveda seem to have become almost identical.	Hankey, Alex	2012 Jul
23124187	Mindfulness-based stress reduction for comorbid anxiety and depression: case report and clinical considerations.	Growing research literature has documented the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions for anxiety and depressive disorders. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) teaches a series of mindfulness meditation and yoga practices, delivered in a group format during eight weekly sessions plus one full-day session. This case report demonstrates how MBSR was associated with dramatic clinical improvement of an individual with symptoms of panic, generalized anxiety, and depression. Scores on clinical assessment measures suggested clinically severe levels of anxious arousal, generalized anxiety, worry, fear of negative evaluation, and depression at the beginning of the intervention. The scores on all these measures fell well within normal limits 7 weeks later at the end of the intervention, and no remaining symptoms were reported afterward. Increased life satisfaction and quality of life were documented as well. This case illustrates the potential benefit of MBSR as an alternative or adjunctive treatment for comorbid anxiety and depressive disorder symptoms.	Hazlett-Stevens, Holly	2012 Nov
23117107	Yoga for chronic neck pain: a pilot randomized controlled clinical trial.	UNLABELLED: Yoga has been found effective in the treatment of chronic low back pain. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Iyengar yoga in chronic neck pain by means of a randomized clinical trial. Seventy-seven patients (aged 47.9 +/- 7.9, 67 female) with chronic neck pain who scored >40 mm on a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) were randomized to a 9-week Iyengar yoga program with weekly 90-minute classes (n = 38) or to a self-care/exercise program (n = 38). Patients were examined at baseline and after 4 and 10 weeks. The primary outcome measure was change of mean pain at rest (VAS) from baseline to week 10. Secondary outcomes included pain at motion, functional disability, quality of life (QOL), and psychological outcomes. Twelve patients in the yoga group and 11 patients in the self-care/exercise group were lost to follow-up, with higher study nonadherence in the self-care group (5 versus 10 patients). Mean pain at rest was reduced from 44.3 +/- 20.1 to 13.0 +/- 11.6 at week 10 by yoga and from 41.9 +/- 21.9 to 34.4 +/- 21.1 by self-care/exercise (group difference: -20.1, 95% confidence interval: -30.0, -10.1; P < .001). Pain at motion was reduced from 53.4 +/- 18.5 to 22.4 +/- 18.7 at week 10 by yoga and from 49.4 +/- 22.8 to 39.9 +/- 21.5 by self-care/exercise (group difference: -18.7, 95% confidence interval: -29.3, -8.1; P < .001). Significant treatment effects of yoga were also found for pain-related apprehension, disability, QOL, and psychological outcomes. Sensitivity analyses suggested minimal influence of dropout rates. Both programs were well tolerated. In this preliminary trial, yoga appears to be an effective treatment in chronic neck pain with possible additional effects on psychological well-being and QOL. The effectiveness of yoga in chronic neck pain should be further tested by comparative effectiveness studies with longer observation periods. PERSPECTIVE: This article presents the results of a randomized controlled trial on the clinical effects of a 9-week yoga program or self-care exercise in patients with chronic neck pain. Yoga led to superior pain relief and functional improvements and might be a useful treatment option for chronic neck pain.

23112963	Physiological effects of yogic practices and transcendental meditation in health and disease.	Yoga is an ancient Indian way of life, which includes changes in mental attitude, diet, and the practice of specific techniques such as yoga asanas (postures), breathing practices (pranayamas), and meditation to attain the highest level of consciousness. Since a decade, there has been a surge in the research on yoga, but we do find very few reviews regarding yogic practices and transcendental meditation (TM) in health and disease. Keeping this in view, a Medline search was done to review relevant articles in English literature on evaluation of physiological effects of yogic practices and TM. Data were constructed; issues were reviewed and found that there were considerable health benefits, including improved cognition, respiration, reduced cardiovascular risk, body mass index, blood pressure, and diabetes. Yoga also influenced immunity and ameliorated joint disorders.	Balaji, P A;Varne, Smitha R;Ali, Syed Sadat	2012 Oct
27257529	A Randomized Controlled Pilot Study Assessing Feasibility and Impact of Yoga Practice on Quality of Life, Mood, and Perceived Stress in Women With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer.	BACKGROUND: A breast cancer diagnosis can entail numerous physical and psychosocial challenges. Yoga practice (YP) may contribute to improved well-being for these patients. PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVE: Investigate feasibility and impact of YP on quality of life (QoL), mood, fatigue, and perceived stress immediately after breast cancer diagnosis. METHODS: Thirty women were randomly assigned to a yoga group (YG) or control group (CG) immediately after cancer diagnosis. SETTING: Pilot study conducted at an academic medical center breast clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Females (N = 30) who received a biopsy-proven breast cancer diagnosis without metastatic disease. INTERVENTION YG: One individual YP session at baseline, then 2 individual and 8 weekly group sessions followed by weekly gentle yoga at home (DVD). Questionnaires and saliva samples (ie, cortisol) completed at baseline and 12 weeks postdiagnosis. RESULTS: Both groups reported significant improvements in QoL postintervention but with no significant difference between groups. Emotional well-being, mood-related tension-anxiety, depression-dejection, and confusion-bewilderment scores improved for both groups, and cortisol and cortisone levels decreased. Lumpectomies were prevalent with YG (67%) and CG (47%). YP was rated as "very effective," providing relaxation (85%), stress relief (69%), and reduced muscle tension/general feeling of wellness (each 62%). CONCLUSION: Feasibility of YP immediately after breast cancer diagnosis was good. Improvement in emotional well-being, anxiety, depression, and levels of confusion was found in both groups. To our knowledge, this is the first study examining the impact of YP immediately after breast cancer diagnosis. Further research in this area is warranted.

23102895	Evaluation of biological rhythms in elderly cancer patients. A complementary translational research within the frame of the trans-hospital pilot program of oncogeriatrics launched at CHC-Liege.	Thanks to the sponsoring of Belgian Cancer Plan, we have launched a trans-hospital project of oncogeriatrics implying any concerned actors from medical (oncology, geriatrics, various specialties) and paramedical staffs (nurses, physiotherapists, ergotherapists, dieteticians, social workers, psychologists...). We aim to recruit 300 consecutive patients aged over 70 and presenting with a new diagnosed cancer. They will benefit from both detailed Comprehensive Geriatrical (CGA) and Oncological (COA) assessments. A multidisciplinary concertation will try to define for each patient an individualized treatment planning taking into account CGA, CGO, co-morbidities, predictive indexes of chemotherapy toxicity (MAX2, i.e.). Detailed records will be obtained in collaboration with the data-management staff. Furthermore, a complementary translational research will include patients for a simple evaluation of their circadian rhythmicities through cortisol titration at 8a.m. and 4p.m. and actometry recordings of the rest-activity rhythms. Future steps could be developed aiming at the restoration of circadian structure disturbances with revalidation (physical exercise, tai-chi, yoga) and resynchronization (melatonin, hydrocortisone, bright light...) programs.

23101047		OBJECTIVES: To examine evidence for whether breathing exercises and retraining techniques lead to improvements in asthma symptoms, reductions in asthma medication use, improved quality of life, or improved pulmonary function in asthma sufferers. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE; PsycInfo; Embase; Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature; Physiotherapy Evidence Database; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; AltHealthWatch; Allied and Complementary Medicine; Manual, Alternative and Natural Therapy Index System; and Indian Medical Journals from 1990 through December 2011. Searches were supplemented with manual searching of reference lists and grey literature, including regulatory documents, conference abstracts, clinical trial registries, and Web sites of professional organizations. METHODS: Analytic framework, Key Questions, and review protocol were developed with input from Key Informants and technical experts. Two independent reviewers screened identified abstracts against predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Two investigators reviewed full-text articles and independently quality-rated those meeting inclusion criteria. Data from fair-and good-quality trials were abstracted into standardized forms and checked by another investigator. We summarized data qualitatively and, where possible, used random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: We identified four types of interventions: hyperventilation reduction breathing techniques, yoga breathing techniques, inspiratory muscle training (IMT), and other nonhyperventilation reduction breathing techniques. We found the most robust body of evidence for hyperventilation reduction breathing techniques in adults, including the only large-scale trial (n=600, aged 14+). Hyperventilation reduction interventions (particularly those with 5 hours or more of patient contact) achieved medium to large improvements in asthma symptoms and reductions in reliever medication use of approximately 1.5 to 2.5 puffs per day, but did not improve pulmonary function. These trials also were more applicable to the U.S. setting than trials examining other interventions due to similarities in applicable treatment guidelines to U.S. guidelines and similar levels of development in the countries in which these studies were conducted, although applicability was still somewhat limited since none were conducted in the United States. Limited evidence suggested yoga breathing may improve pulmonary function in adults in addition to reducing asthma symptoms, but medication use was rarely reported and applicability to the United States was very low. Evidence for IMT and other breathing retraining techniques was limited to small, heterogeneous trials providing insufficient evidence to determine effectiveness. The only harms of breathing retraining techniques identified were minor annoyances associated with mouth-taping. Almost all trials were limited entirely or primarily to adults. CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral approaches that include hyperventilation reduction techniques can improve asthma symptoms or reduce reliever medication use over 6 to 12 months in adults with poorly controlled asthma and have no known harmful effects. However, available evidence is limited in its strength and applicability to the United States. Evidence supporting yoga breathing is weaker and applicability to the United States is very low.

23099604	Mainstreaming AYUSH: an ethical analysis.	The National Rural Health Mission has stated as one of its key mandates the mainstreaming of the Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) systems in order to help solve the human resource shortage in Indian healthcare. This has been planned at the primary level by providing training to AYUSH practitioners on primary care and national health programmes; at the secondary level by establishing departments of AYUSH in the district and taluka level hospitals; and at the tertiary level by establishing AYUSH centres of excellence as referral centres, and research, development and supervision points. The practical challenges to be considered include a gross divergence in the basic philosophy of practice; disparities in approach to specific clinical conditions; differences in their normative approach in decision making; an unclear policy for cross referral and problems of cross practice that could potentially rise in this condition. Mainstreaming of AYUSH into the existing public health system can have certain ethical implications: not doing good by failing to concentrate on the community value judgments about AYUSH; doing harm by a confusing plurality in approach and unhealthy segregation of practices without healthy dialogue between practitioners of either system; not disclosing which type of practitioners (AYUSH or allopathy) the patient is seeing; lack of proper public accountability mechanisms at the primary care and grassroots levels; and, finally, lack of social justice.

Survivors of torture and refugee trauma often have increased needs for mental and physical healthcare. This is due in part to the complex sequelae of trauma, including chronic pain, major depressive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and somatization. This article reviews the scientific medical literature for the efficacy and feasibility of some complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) modalities including meditation, Ayurveda, pranayama/yogic breathing, massage/body-work, dance/movement, spirituality, yoga, music, Traditional Chinese Medicine and acupuncture, qigong, t'ai chi, chiropractic, homeopathy, aromatherapy and Reiki specifically with respect to survivors of torture and refugee trauma. We report that preliminary research suggests that the certain CAM modalities may prove effective as part of an integrated treatment plan for survivors of torture and refugee trauma. Further research is warranted.	Longacre, McKenna;Silver-Highfield, Ellen;Lama, Puja;Grodin, Michael	2012
23082079	Guidelines for developing yoga interventions for randomized trials.	Little guidance is available to assist researchers in developing treatment protocols for research on yoga for health concerns. Because yoga is a complex multifactorial mind-body discipline historically developed for nonmedical purposes, numerous decisions must be made in order to thoughtfully develop such protocols. In this paper, a systematic approach is proposed to assist researchers in selecting an intervention that is appropriate for the condition under consideration and explicitly developed. Researchers need to consider the type or "style" of yoga, the components to include (e.g., breathing exercises, postures) as well as the specific protocol for each component, the dose to be delivered (frequency, duration of practice, and the total duration of practice), and issues related to selection of instructors and monitoring the fidelity to the intervention. Each of these domains and the key issues for the development of protocols is discussed. Finally, some areas for further research related to protocol development are recommended.	Sherman, Karen J	2012
23076942	Breathing exercises for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	BACKGROUND: Breathing exercises for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) aim to alter respiratory muscle recruitment, improve respiratory muscle performance and reduce dyspnoea. Although some studies have reported positive short-term physiological effects of breathing exercises in people with COPD, their effects on dyspnoea, exercise capacity and well being are unclear. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether breathing exercises in people with COPD have beneficial effects on dyspnoea, exercise capacity and health-related quality of life compared to no breathing exercises in people with COPD; and to determine whether there are any adverse effects of breathing exercises in people with COPD. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials and the PEDro database were searched from inception to October 2011. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised parallel trials that compared breathing exercises to no breathing exercises or another intervention in people with COPD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Primary outcomes were dyspnoea, exercise capacity and health-related quality of life; secondary outcomes were gas exchange, breathing pattern and adverse events. To determine whether effects varied according to the treatment used, we assessed each breathing technique separately. MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen studies involving 1233 participants with mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)) 30% to 51% predicted were included. There was a significant improvement in six-minute walk distance after three months of yoga involving pranayama timed breathing techniques (mean difference to control 45 metres, 95% confidence interval 29 to 61 metres; two studies; 74 participants), with similar improvements in single studies of pursed lip breathing (mean 50 metres; 60 participants) and diaphragmatic breathing (mean 35 metres; 30 participants). Effects on dyspnoea and health-related quality of life were inconsistent across trials. Addition of computerised ventilation feedback to exercise training did not provide additional improvement in dyspnoea-related quality of life (standardised mean difference -0.03; 95% CI -0.43 to 0.49; two studies; 73 participants) and ventilation feedback alone was less effective than exercise training alone for improving exercise endurance (mean difference -15.4 minutes; 95% CI -28.1 to -2.7 minutes; one study; 32 participants). No significant adverse effects were reported. Few studies reported details of allocation concealment, assessor blinding or intention-to-treat analysis. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Breathing exercises over four to 15 weeks improve functional exercise capacity in people with COPD compared to no intervention; however, there are no consistent effects on dyspnoea or health-related quality of life. Outcomes were similar across all the breathing exercises examined. Treatment effects for patient-reported outcomes may have been overestimated owing to lack of blinding. Breathing exercises may be useful to improve exercise tolerance in selected individuals with COPD who are unable to undertake exercise training; however, these data do not suggest a widespread role for breathing exercises in the comprehensive management of people with COPD.

23072266	Has the use of complementary and alternative medicine therapies by U.S. adults with chronic disease-related functional limitations changed from 2002 to 2007?	OBJECTIVES: This study examined changes in the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies by U.S. adults aged 18 years or older with chronic disease-related functional limitations between 2002 and 2007. DESIGN: The study was a cross-sectional survey. SETTING/LOCATION: The study was conducted in the United States. SUBJECTS: The study comprised adults aged 18 years or older with chronic disease-related functional limitations. METHODS: Data were obtained from the 2002 and 2007 U.S. National Health Interview Survey to compare the use of 22 CAM therapies (n=9313 and n=7014, respectively). Estimates were age adjusted to the year 2000 U.S. standard population. RESULTS: The unadjusted and age-standardized prevalence of overall CAM use (22 therapies comparable between both survey years) was higher in 2007 than in 2002 (30.6% versus 26.9%, p<0.001 and 34.4% versus 30.6%, p<0.001, respectively). Adults with functional limitations that included changing and maintaining body position experienced a significant increase in CAM use between 2002 and 2007 (31.1%-35.0%, p<0.01). The use of deep breathing exercises was the most prevalent CAM therapy in both 2002 and 2007 and increased significantly during this period (from 17.9% to 19.9%, p<0.05). The use of meditation, massage, and yoga also increased significantly from 2002 and 2007 (11.0%-13.5%, p<0.01; 7.0%-10.9%, p<0.0001; and 5.1% to 6.6%, p<0.05, respectively), while the use of the Atkins diet decreased (2.2%- 1.4%, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Among U.S. adults with chronic disease-related functional limitations, the overall increase in CAM use from 2002 to 2007 was significant, particularly among those with changing and maintaining body position limitations.

23070681	YogaHome: teaching and research challenges in a yoga program with homeless adults.	YogaHome is a therapeutic yoga program for homeless women. Developing and refining YogaHome provided a unique opportunity to explore the process of teaching yoga to women faced with the physical and emotional stress of living in a homeless shelter. Unique teaching and research challenges are presented and recommendations for future programs are discussed.	Davis-Berman, Jennifer;Farkas, Jean	2012
23070680	Yoga in the schools: a systematic review of the literature.	OBJECTIVE: The objective of this research was to examine the evidence for delivering yoga-based interventions in schools. METHODS: An electronic literature search was conducted to identify peer-reviewed, published studies in which yoga and a meditative component (breathing practices or meditation) were taught to youths in a school setting. Pilot studies, single cohort, quasi-experimental, and randomized clinical trials were considered. RESEARCH: quality was evaluated and summarized. RESULTS: Twelve published studies were identified. Samples for which yoga was implemented as an intervention included youths with autism, intellectual disability, learning disability, and emotional disturbance, as well as typically developing youths. CONCLUSION: Although effects of participating in school-based yoga programs appeared to be beneficial for the most part, methodological limitations, including lack of randomization, small samples, limited detail regarding the intervention, and statistical ambiguities curtailed the ability to provide definitive conclusions or recommendations. Findings speak to the need for greater methodological rigor and an increased understanding of the mechanisms of success for school-based yoga interventions.

23070679	Yoga and quality-of-life improvement in patients with breast cancer: a literature review.	OBJECTIVE: Women undergoing treatment for breast cancer often turn to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), including yoga, for improvement of mood, quality of life (QOL), sleep, and treatment-related side effects. The extant literature was reviewed to examine the clinical effects of yoga practice on QOL for patients with breast cancer. QOL was defined as physical well-being, social functioning, emotional health, and function-al adaptation. METHODS: Seven databases, including PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were used to search for studies of patients with breast cancer that included a yoga intervention and QOL assessment. Attention was paid to assessing study population, outcome variables, the type of yoga intervention used, and methodological strengths and limitations. RESULTS: Seventy-one articles were identified that fit the search criteria. Although the literature provided evidence of QOL benefits of yoga for patients with breast cancer, no specific aspect of yoga was identified as being most advantageous. CONCLUSION: Although participation in yoga programs appeared to benefit patients with breast cancer, greater methodological rigor is required to understand the mechanisms that contribute to their effectiveness.

23070677	Building bridges for yoga therapy research: the Aetna, Inc. mind-body pilot study on chronic and high stress.	In 2009, Aetna, Inc., invited Gary Kraftsow and the American Viniyoga Institute (AVI) to contribute to a research study on modulating stress. This partnership represented the first formal recognition of the potential role of yoga therapy in modern healthcare by an insurance company. This project exemplified the power and value of a collaboration in which yoga therapists made the ancient yoga teachings relevant to healthcare research. We must under-stand our own ancient traditions, learn the language of Western medicine, and recognize opportunities to build bridges to medical disciplines, academic partners, insurers, funders, and policy makers.

23070675	The use of yoga in specialized VA PTSD treatment programs.	BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic, debilitating anxiety disorder that is highly prevalent among U.S. military veterans. Yoga, defined to include physical postures (asana) and mindfulness and meditation, is being increasingly used as an adjunctive treatment for PTSD and other psychological disorders. No research or administrative data have detailed the use of these services in Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) 170 PTSD treatment programs. METHODS: One hundred twenty-five program coordinators or designated staff completed an 81-item survey of their program's use of complementary and alternative medicine modalities in the past year. This report describes data from a subset of 30 questions used to assess the prevalence, nature, and context of the use of yoga, mindfulness, and meditation other than mindfulness practices. RESULTS: Results revealed that these practices are widely offered in VA specialized PTSD treatment programs and that there is great variability in the context and nature of how they are delivered. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding how yoga is used by these programs may inform ongoing efforts to define and distinguish yoga therapy as a respected therapeutic discipline and to create patient-centered care models that mindfully fulfill the unmet needs of individuals with mental health issues, including veterans with PTSD.

23070674	Clinical group supervision in yoga therapy: model effects, and lessons learned.	Clinical supervision is an integral component of therapist training and professional development because of its capacity for fostering knowledge, self-awareness, and clinical acumen. Individual supervision is part of many yoga therapy training programs and is referenced in the IAYT Standards as "mentoring." Group supervision is not typically used in the training of yoga therapists. We propose that group supervision effectively supports the growth and development of yoga therapists-in-training. We present a model of group supervision for yoga therapist trainees developed by the New England School of Integrative Yoga Therapeutics (The NESIYT Model) that includes the background, structure, format, and development of our inaugural 18-month supervision group. Pre-and post-supervision surveys and analyzed case notes, which captured key didactic and process themes, are discussed. Clinical issues, such as boundaries, performance anxiety, sense of self efficacy, the therapeutic alliance, transference and counter transference, pacing of yoga therapy sessions, evaluation of client progress, and adjunct therapist interaction are reviewed. The timing and sequence of didactic and process themes and benefits for yoga therapist trainees' professional development, are discussed. The NESIYT group supervision model is offered as an effective blueprint for yoga therapy training programs.	Forbes, Bo;Volpe Horii, Cassandra;Earls, Bethany;Mashek, Stephanie;Akhtar, Fiona	2012

23070672	Gentle Hatha yoga and reduction of fibromyalgia-related symptoms: a preliminary report.	OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: This study examined whether gentle Hatha yoga reduced fibromyalgia-related symptoms for a convenience sample of 10 participants ranging in age from 39 to 64 years who received yoga instruction 2 times per week for 8 weeks. METHODS: Respondents completed the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire 1 time per week and provided weekly journal reports regarding their health status. Pre- and post-intervention manual tender point evaluations were also conducted. RESULTS: Findings provide evidence of association between participating in gentle Hatha yoga classes and reduced fibromyalgia - related symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Additional randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes and greater empirical rigor are needed to more fully understand this relationship.	Rudrud, Lisa	2012
23070671	Respiratory, physical, and psychological benefits of breath-focused yoga for adults with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI): a brief pilot study report.	OBJECTIVE: This pilot study was designed to identify the potential benefits of breath-focused yoga on respiratory, physical, and psychological functioning for adults with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). PARTICIPANTS: Ten individuals with severe TBI who self-selected to attend weekly yoga classes and 4 no-treatment controls were evaluated. METHODS: Participants were assessed at pretreatment baseline and at 3-month intervals for a total of 4 time points over 40 weeks. Outcomes of interest included observed exhale strength, ability to hold a breath or a tone, breathing rate, counted breaths (inhale and exhale), and heart rate, as well as self-reported physical and psycho-logical well-being. RESULTS: Repeated within-group analyses of variance revealed that the yoga group demonstrated significant longitudinal change on several measures of observed respiratory functioning and self-reported physical and psychological well-being over a 40-week period. Those in the control group showed marginal improvement on 2 of the 6 measures of respiratory health, physical and social functioning, emotional well-being, and general health. The small sample sizes precluded the analysis of between group differences. CONCLUSION: This study provides preliminary evidence that breath-focused yoga may improve respiratory functioning and self-perceived physical and psychological well-being of adults with severe TBI.

23070670	Pain uncertainty in patients with fibromyalgia, yoga practitioners, and healthy volunteers.	BACKGROUND: Uncertainty about potentially painful events affects how pain is experienced. Individuals with fibromyalgia (FM) often exhibit anxiety and catastrophic thoughts regarding pain and difficulties dealing with pain uncertainty. OBJECTIVES: The effects of pain uncertainty in predictably high odds (HO), predictably low odds (LO), and even odds (EO) conditions on subjective ratings of pain (PR) and skin conductance responses (SCR) following the administration of a painful stimulus were examined for individuals with fibromyalgia (IWFM), healthy volunteers (HVs), and yoga practitioners (YPs). We hypothesized IWFM would demonstrate the greatest physiological reactivity to pain uncertainty, followed by HVs and YPs, respectively. METHODS: Nine IWFM, 7 YPs, and 10 HVs participated. RESULTS: Custom contrast estimates comparing responses for HO, LO, and EO pain conditions showed higher SCR for IWFM (CE = 1.27, p = 0.01) but not for HVs or for YPs. PR for the EO condition were significantly greater than for HO and LO conditions for IWFM (CE = 0.60, p = 0.012) but not for HVs or YPs. YPs had lower SCR and PR than did HVs. CONCLUSIONS: Results show that uncertainty regarding pain increases the experience of pain, whereas certainty regarding pain may reduce pain ratings for individuals with fibromyalgia.

23070669	A responder analysis of the effects of yoga for individuals with COPD: who benefits and how?	BACKGROUND: We previously reported that a twice-weekly, modified Iyengar yoga program was a safe and viable self-management strategy for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 1 OBJECTIVE: The primary purpose of this exploratory analysis was to classify yoga participants into 1 of 3 responder categories by using minimum clinically important difference (MCID) criteria for each of 3 variables: 6-minute walk distance (6MW), distress related to dyspnea (shortness of breath; DD), and functional performance (FPI). Changes in health-related quality of life (HRQL) and in psychological well-being (anxiety and depression), and participants' self-reported improvements by responder category were also examined. A secondary goal was to identify baseline participant characteristics, including initial randomization assignment that might predict response to treatment. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to either an initial yoga (IY) or an enhanced wait-list control (WLC) group. Those in the WLC group were offered the yoga program immediately following the IY group's participation. Individuals from both groups who completed at least 18 of 24 yoga classes were categorized as responders, partial responders, or non-responders for each of the 3 outcome variables (6MW, DD, FPI) on the basis of MCID criteria. Baseline characteristics and changes in HRQL and psychological well-being were also analyzed. RESULTS: None of the participants demonstrated MCIDs for all 3 outcomes; however, 6 were classified as responders for 2 out-come variables and 4 were classified as non-responders for all 3 outcome variables. Two-thirds of the female participant group and one-third of the male participant group completed the yoga program. DD responders showed increased anxiety levels, whereas anxiety levels of the DD non-responders remained unchanged. FPI responders reported significant improvements in physical function, whereas partial and non-FPI responders noted declined function. Participants assigned to the IY group demonstrated greater benefit from yoga than did those in the W LC group. CONCLUSIONS: Although this modified Iyengar yoga program appears to have benefited some individuals with COPD, further studies are required to assess who the intervention works for and under what conditions.

23070668	Psychological well-being, health behaviors, and weight loss among participants in a residential, Kripalu yoga-based weight loss program.	UNLABELLED: The increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity in humans is a growing public health concern in the United States. Concomitants include poor health behaviors and reduced psychological well-being. Preliminary evidence suggests yoga and treatment paradigms incorporating mindfulness, self-compassion (SC), acceptance, non-dieting, and intuitive eating may improve these ancillary correlates, which may promote long-term weight loss. METHODS: We explored the impact of a 5-day residential weight loss program, which was multifaceted and based on Kripalu yoga, on health behaviors, weight loss, and psychological well-being in overweight/obese individuals. Thirty-seven overweight/obese program participants (age 32-65, BMI<25) completed validated mind-fulness, SC, lifestyle behavior, and mood questionnaires at baseline, post-program, and 3-month follow-up and reported their weight 1 year after program completion. RESULTS: Significant improvements in nutrition behaviors, SC, mindfulness, stress management, and spiritual growth were observed immediately post-program (n = 31, 84% retention), with medium to large effect sizes. At 3-month follow-up (n = 18, 49% retention), most changes persisted. Physical activity and mood disturbance had improved significantly post-program but failed to reach significance at 3-month follow-up. Self-report weight loss at 1 year (n = 19, 51% retention) was significant. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a Kripalu yoga-based, residential weight loss program may foster psychological well-being, improved nutrition behaviors, and weight loss. Given the exploratory nature of this investigation, more rigorous work in this area is warranted.	Braun, Tosca D;Park, Crystal L;Conboy, Lisa Ann	2012

23062021	Therapeutic effect of yoga in patients with hypertension with reference to GST gene polymorphism.	BACKGROUND: Hypertension, a chronic medical condition of increased blood pressure, is a serious public health problem. Environmental and genetic risk factors are known to predispose to hypertension. The present study was designed to investigate the association of glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene polymorphism with oxidative stress in hypertensive patients and the possible beneficial effect of yoga on them. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty (60) hypertensive individuals, between 30 and 60 years of age, were divided into two groups of 30 each. The yoga group was subjected to 50-60 minutes of yogic practices daily for 42 days, while the control group included the remaining 30 age- and sex-matched hypertensive individuals. GST gene polymorphism was analyzed using multiple allele specific polymerase chain reaction, and oxidative stress parameters were assessed biochemically. RESULTS: Assessment of blood pressure showed a statistically significant though modest reduction (p<0.05) in the yoga group as compared to the control group. Malondialdehyde was observed to be significantly low (p<0.05), while antioxidant capacity in the form of GST showed an increasing trend and ferric-reducing ability of plasma was significantly increased (p<0.05) in the subjects who practiced yoga. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, yoga has been found to decrease blood pressure as well as the levels of oxidative stress in patients with hypertension.

23061176	Addressing the unique psychosocial barriers to breast cancer treatment experienced by African-American women through integrative navigation.	African-American women face a disproportionally high breast cancer mortality rate and a significantly low five-year survival rate after breast cancer treatment. This study investigated, through a series of focus groups, how 32 African-American women (N = 32) breast cancer patients and survivors managed their cancer-related health needs. Participants also reported important barriers to care including problematic interactions with medical professionals, challenges in intimate relations, difficulties in handling the stigma and myths about breast cancer, and the psychological challenges that they faced. A patient navigation model was implemented at an eastern urban hospital that emphasized integrative therapies such as meditation, nutritional instruction, and yoga. Follow-up telephone interviews with 37 additional African-American participants (N = 37) indicated the rating of effectiveness to be at 3.8 to 3.9 out of 4 for the integrative patient navigation program. Over half of the survivors reported using some complementary techniques after treatment was completed, thus suggesting a long-term improvement in their quality of life as a result of the integrative techniques.

23059439	Pilot study of yoga for breast cancer survivors with poor quality of life.	INTRODUCTION: Studies show benefits of yoga for breast cancer patients with poor quality of life (QOL); however, none exclusively focus on survivors. This study addresses whether hatha yoga improves breast cancer survivors' QOL. METHODS: 25 breast cancer survivors completed six weeks of yoga. Outcome measures were 5 QOL categories evaluated using the FACT-B survey pre and post-intervention and after 6 months. RESULTS: Each category was evaluated independently, including: physical (PWB), social (SWB), emotional (EWB), functional (FWB), breast cancer specific well-being (BCS), Trial Outcome Index (TOI), FACT-G, and FACT-B. Significant improvement was found in all categories except social well-being (PWB p = .013, EWB p = .005, FWB p = .003, BCS p < .001, TOI p < .001, FACT-G p = .004, FACT-B p < .001). Patients with below average pre-intervention index scores (n = 13) showed greater improvement in EWB and FWB, while those with above average pre-intervention scores (n = 9) showed greater improvement in PWB. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga may be feasible and clinically useful for breast cancer survivors with poor QOL.	Levine, Alison S;Balk, Judith L	2012 Nov
23059438	Mindfulness yoga during pregnancy for psychiatrically at-risk women: preliminary results from a pilot feasibility study.	Prenatal psychopathology may have an adverse impact on mother and baby, but few women receive treatment. We offered a 10-week mindfulness yoga (M-Yoga) intervention to psychiatrically high-risk pregnant women as an alternative to pharmacological treatment. Participants (N = 18) were primiparous, 12-26 weeks pregnant, and had elevated scores (>9) on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Screen at baseline. In addition to a baseline diagnostic assessment, women completed self-ratings on depression, mindfulness, and maternal-fetal attachment before and after M-Yoga. Findings suggest that M-Yoga was feasible, accepted and effective. Symptoms of depression were significantly reduced (p = 0.025), while mindfulness (p = 0.007) and maternal-fetal attachment (p = 0.000) significantly increased. Overall, this pilot study is the first to demonstrate that M-Yoga may be an effective treatment alternative or augmentation to pharmacotherapy for pregnant women at high risk for psychopathology.

23052917	Randomised controlled trials of yoga interventions for women with breast cancer: a systematic literature review.	PURPOSE: Yoga is increasingly used as a complementary therapy to manage disease and treatment-related side effects in patients with cancer and has resulted in an increase in the number of studies exploring the effectiveness of yoga interventions. This systematic review examines whether yoga interventions provide any measurable benefit, both physically and psychologically, for women with breast cancer. The results will inform future research in this field and advance the development of yoga programmes. METHODS: We performed electronic searches of MEDLINE, PsychINFO, the Cochrane Library, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, Web of Science and Scopus for articles published up to June 2012. Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included and methodological quality rating scores were determined using the PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) Scale. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-two studies were identified through a systematic search of eight electronic databases. Only published manuscripts that employed a RCT design were included (n = 18). The sample sizes for these studies varied widely from 18 to 164 participants and the associated PEDro scores ranged from 1 (poor) to 8 (good). All 18 studies reported positive effects for treatment-related side effects in favour of the yoga interventions, with the greatest impact on global quality of life (QoL) scores and emotional well-being. CONCLUSION: Results from the few RCTs suggest there is moderate to good evidence that yoga may be a useful practice for women recovering from breast cancer treatments. Large-scale RCTs using objective measures and patient-reported outcomes with long-term follow-up are needed to substantiate whether the benefits are true and sustainable.

23049608	Iyengar yoga for distressed women: a 3-armed randomized controlled trial.	Distress is an increasing public health problem. We aimed to investigate the effects of an Iyengar yoga program on perceived stress and psychological outcomes in distressed women and evaluated a potential dose-effect relationship. Seventy-two female distressed subjects were included into a 3-armed randomized controlled trial and allocated to yoga group 1 (n = 24) with twelve 90 min sessions over 3 months, yoga group 2 (n = 24) with 24 sessions over 3 months, or a waiting list control group (n = 24). The primary outcome was stress perception, measured by Cohen Stress Scale; secondary outcomes included state trait anxiety, depression, psychological and physical quality of life (QOL), profile of Mood States, well being, and bodily complaints. After three months, women in the yoga groups showed significant improvements in perceived stress (P = 0.003), state trait anxiety (P = 0.021 and P = 0.003), depression (P = 0.008), psychological QOL (P = 0.012), mood states being (P = 0.007), and bodily complaints well(P = 0.012) when compared to controls. Both yoga programs were similarly effective for these outcomes; however, compliance was better in the group with fewer sessions (yoga group 1). Dose effects were seen only in the analysis of group-independent effects for back pain, anxiety, and depression. These findings suggest that Iyengar yoga effectively reduces distress and improves related psychological and physical outcomes. Furthermore, attending twice-weekly yoga classes was not superior to once-weekly classes, as a result of limited compliance in the twice-weekly group.

23049192	A comparative study of Bilvadi Yoga Ashchyotana and eye drops in Vataja Abhishyanda (Simple Allergic Conjunctivitis).	Simple allergic conjunctivitis is the most common form of ocular allergy (prevalence 5 - 22 %). It is a hypersensitivity reaction to specific airborne antigens. The disease Vataja Abhishyanda, which is due to vitiation of Vata Pradhana Tridosha is comparable with this condition. The management of simple allergic conjunctivitis in modern ophthalmology is very expensive and it should be followed lifelong and Ayurveda can provide better relief in such manifestation. This is the first research study on Vataja Abhishyanda. Patients were selected from the Outpatient Department (OPD), Inpatient Department (IPD), of the Shalakya Tantra Department and were randomly divided into two groups. In Group-A Bilvadi Ashchyotana and in Group-B Bilvadi eye drops were instilled for three months. Total 32 patients were registered and 27 patients completed the course of treatment. Bilvadi Ashchyotana gave better results in Toda, Sangharsha, Parushya, Kandu and Ragata as compared with Bilvadi Eye Drops in Vataja Abhishyanda.

23047802	Perceptions about using mindfulness therapy: a lung cancer focus group study.	BACKGROUND: Patients with lung cancer are in need of effective strategies to modify symptom burden and improve health-related quality of life (HRQOL). One promising approach to symptom management is an 8-week mindfulness-based intervention, which incorporates meditation, breathing, and gentle yoga exercises. It requires few resources to implement, but has not been adequately tested with lung cancer patients. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to obtain lung cancer patient perceptions of a mindfulness-based intervention. METHODS: Eleven lung cancer patients participated in audio-taped focus group sessions led by the investigator. Discussion questions probed patient perceptions of mindfulness in terms of symptom management, including benefits and barriers to this therapy and ways the intervention may need to be adapted to accommodate them. RESULTS: Three primary themes from the qualitative analysis include (1) awareness and interest, (2) perceived barriers and benefits, and (3) recommended adaptations. Specific perceptions included the importance of targeting key symptoms such as dyspnea, worry, and insomnia, whereas recommendations pointed out the need for a shorter duration than the standard 8-week protocol and a home-based approach for greater accessibility. CONCLUSIONS: The design of mindfulness-based intervention protocols must consider unique characteristics of this vulnerable group, such as targeting specific symptoms, reducing the 8-week protocol, and a home-based offering. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurses are integral to optimizing HRQOL and independent functioning for lung cancer patients. As lung cancer survivorship is extended, it becomes increasingly imperative that a range of supportive resources is available for patients to manage symptoms and improve HRQOL.

23041680	Use of conventional, complementary, and alternative treatments for pain among individuals seeking primary care treatment with buprenorphine-naloxone.	UNLABELLED: Previous studies have not examined patterns of pain treatment use among patients seeking office-based buprenorphine-naloxone treatment (BNT) for opioid dependence. OBJECTIVES: To examine, among individuals with pain seeking BNT for opioid dependence, the use of pain treatment modalities, perceived efficacy of prior pain treatment, and interest in pursuing pain treatment while in BNT. METHODS: A total of 244 patients seeking office-based BNT for opioid dependence completed measures of demographics, pain status (ie, "chronic pain (CP)" [pain lasting at least 3 months] vs "some pain (SP)" [pain in the past week not meeting the duration criteria for chronic pain]), pain treatment use, perceived efficacy of prior pain treatment, and interest in receiving pain treatment while in BNT. RESULTS: In comparison with the SP group (N = 87), the CP group (N = 88) was more likely to report past-week medical use of opioid medication (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.2; 95% CI, 1.2-8.4), lifetime medical use of nonopioid prescribed medication (AOR = 2.2; 95% CI, 1.1-4.7), and lifetime use of prayer (AOR = 2.8; 95% CI, 1.2-6.5) and was less likely to report lifetime use of yoga (AOR = 0.2; 95% CI, 0.1-0.7) to treat pain. Although the 2 pain groups did not differ on levels of perceived efficacy of prior lifetime pain treatments, in comparison with the SP group, the CP group was more likely to report interest in receiving pain treatment while in BNT (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with pain seeking BNT for opioid dependence report a wide range of conventional, complementary, and alternative pain-related treatments and are interested (especially those with CP) in receiving pain management services along with BNT.

23037499	Menopausal symptoms in young survivors of breast cancer: a growing problem without an ideal solution.	BACKGROUND: New breast cancers occur in 25% to 30% of women < 50 years of age. These young women undergo ablative surgery, chemotherapy, or hormonal/targeted treatment. These treatments have resulted in increased survival but at the expense of early menopause, marked by distressing vasomotor symptoms, sexual dysfunction, decreased metabolism, and musculoskeletal and cardiovascular effects. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed using PubMed. This article reviews the evidence-based approaches to the treatment of these distressing symptoms in young breast cancer survivors. RESULTS: Menopausal symptoms in young patients are typically more severe due to the abrupt and rapid decrease in estrogen, and chemotherapy and hormones worsen these symptoms. Evidence supporting the efficacy of most complementary therapies is scarce. Behavioral modification and yoga may be helpful in mild cases of vasomotor symptoms, whereas newer antidepressants are promising in moderate to severe cases, and stellate ganglion block may be used in refractory cases. Local vaginal moisturizers, and in refractory cases low-dose estrogen creams, may ameliorate most urogenital symptoms. Bisphosphonates, vitamin D, and calcium can treat osteoporosis, and weight-bearing exercises decrease bone mineral density loss and help to control weight. Smoking cessation, exercise, and dietary modifications should be recommended to all young patients to decrease cardiac morbidity. At present, there is insufficient evidence to support any natural agent as a viable alternative to hormone replacement therapy to treat these symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: No single agent can ameliorate vasomotor, cardiac, skeletal, and sexual concerns of young breast cancer survivors coping with menopausal symptoms. Quality-of-life research involving premenopausal breast cancer survivors is lacking. Further study is needed to identify safe and effective treatments for menopausal symptoms and to confirm their long-term safety in young breast cancer survivors.

23029966	Effect of yoga practices on pulmonary function tests including transfer factor of lung for carbon monoxide (TLCO) in asthma patients.	Prana is the energy, when the self-energizing force embraces the body with extension and expansion and control, it is pranayama. It may affect the milieu at the bronchioles and the alveoli particularly at the alveolo-capillary membrane to facilitate diffusion and transport of gases. It may also increase oxygenation at tissue level. Aim of our study is to compare pulmonary functions and diffusion capacity in patients of bronchial asthma before and after yogic intervention of 2 months. Sixty stable asthmatic-patients were randomized into two groups i.e group 1 (Yoga training group) and group 2 (control group). Each group included thirty patients. Lung functions were recorded on all patients at baseline, and then after two months. Group 1 subjects showed a statistically significant improvement (P<0.001) in Transfer factor of the lung for carbon monoxide (TLCO), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1st sec (FEV1), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) and slow vital capacity (SVC) after yoga practice. Quality of life also increased significantly. It was concluded that pranayama & yoga breathing and stretching postures are used to increase respiratory stamina, relax the chest muscles, expand the lungs, raise energy levels, and calm the body.

23015682	The importance of supportive care in optimizing treatment outcomes of patients with advanced prostate cancer.	Optimal oncologic care of older men with prostate cancer, including effective prevention and management of the disease and treatment side effects (so-called best supportive care measures) can prolong survival, improve quality of life, and reduce depressive symptoms. In addition, the proportion of treatment discontinuations can be reduced through early reporting and management of side effects. Pharmacologic care may be offered to manage the side effects of androgen-deprivation therapy and chemotherapy, which may include hot flashes, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, and diarrhea. Nonpharmacologic care (e.g., physical exercise, acupuncture, relaxation) has also been shown to benefit patients. At the Georges Pompidou European Hospital, the Program of Optimization of Chemotherapy Administration has demonstrated that improved outpatient follow-up by supportive care measures can reduce the occurrence of chemotherapy-related side effects, reduce cancellations and modifications of treatment, reduce chemotherapy wastage, and reduce the length of stay in the outpatient unit. The importance of supportive care measures to optimize management and outcomes of older men with advanced prostate cancer should not be overlooked.	Scotte, Florian	2012
23023557	Relationship between the retinal microvasculature and renal volume in low-birth-weight babies.	OBJECTIVE: We performed a study to assess whether the development of the retinal microvasculature reflects nephron growth and therefore nephron number. STUDY DESIGN: In our study, we determined the association between kidney volume (nephron number) and the retinal microvasculature of term low-birth-weight (LBW) and normal-birth-weight (NBW) infants (11 LBW and 27 NBW). RESULTS: LBW infants had significantly larger retinal arteriolar and venular diameters (104.2 +/- 21.4 versus 87.0 +/- 12.7 mum; p = 0.004; 146.8 +/- 19.5 versus 128.0 +/- 19.5 mum; p = 0.01, respectively) compared with NBW infants. LBW infants also had smaller mean renal volumes (9.3 +/- 2.3 versus 12.2 +/- 3.1 ml; p = 0.008). There were negative correlations between retinal arteriolar and venular diameters and renal volumes (r = -0.34, p < 0.05; r = -0.37, p < 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSION: The larger the kidney (and, by implication, the greater the nephron number), the smaller are the diameters of retinal arterioles and venules. Thus, the degree of dilation of the retinal microvasculature provides an indirect index of renal growth.	Kandasamy, Yogavijayan;Smith, Roger;Wright, Ian M R	2013 Jun
25328287	Activities and Programs That Improve Children's Executive Functions.	Executive functions (EFs; e.g., reasoning, working memory, and self-control) can be improved. Good news indeed, since EFs are critical for school and job success and for mental and physical health. Various activities appear to improve children's EFs. The best evidence exists for computer-based training, traditional martial arts, and two school curricula. Weaker evidence, though strong enough to pass peer review, exists for aerobics, yoga, mindfulness, and other school curricula. Here I address what can be learned from the research thus far, including that EFs need to be progressively challenged as children improve and that repeated practice is key. Children devote time and effort to activities they love; therefore, EF interventions might use children's motivation to advantage. Focusing narrowly on EFs or aerobic activity alone appears not to be as efficacious in improving EFs as also addressing children's emotional, social, and character development (as do martial arts, yoga, and curricula shown to improve EFs). Children with poorer EFs benefit more from training; hence, training might provide them an opportunity to "catch up" with their peers and not be left behind. Remaining questions include how long benefits of EF training last and who benefits most from which activities.	Diamond, Adele	2012 Oct
23012344	Yoga for reducing perceived stress and back pain at work.	BACKGROUND: Stress and back pain are two key factors leading to sickness absence at work. Recent research indicates that yoga can be effective for reducing perceived stress, alleviating back pain, and improving psychological well-being. AIMS: To determine the effectiveness of a yoga-based intervention for reducing perceived stress and back pain at work. METHODS: Participants were recruited from a British local government authority and randomized into a yoga group who received one 50 min Dru Yoga session each week for 8 weeks and a 20 min DVD for home practice and a control group who received no intervention. Baseline and end-programme measurements of self-reported stress, back pain and psychological well-being were assessed with the Perceived Stress Scale, Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale. RESULTS: There were 37 participants in each group. Analysis of variance and multiple linear regression showed that in comparison to the control group, the yoga group reported significant reductions in perceived stress and back pain, and a substantial improvement in psychological well-being. When compared with the control group at the end of the programme, the yoga group scores were significantly lower for perceived stress, back pain, sadness and hostility, and substantially higher for feeling self-assured, attentive and serene. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that a workplace yoga intervention can reduce perceived stress and back pain and improve psychological well-being. Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the broader efficacy of yoga for improving workplace productivity and reducing sickness absence.

23008738	Effects of yoga on mental and physical health: a short summary of reviews.	This report summarizes the current evidence on the effects of yoga interventions on various components of mental and physical health, by focussing on the evidence described in review articles. Collectively, these reviews suggest a number of areas where yoga may well be beneficial, but more research is required for virtually all of them to firmly establish such benefits. The heterogeneity among interventions and conditions studied has hampered the use of meta-analysis as an appropriate tool for summarizing the current literature. Nevertheless, there are some meta-analyses which indicate beneficial effects of yoga interventions, and there are several randomized clinical trials (RCT's) of relatively high quality indicating beneficial effects of yoga for pain-associated disability and mental health. Yoga may well be effective as a supportive adjunct to mitigate some medical conditions, but not yet a proven stand-alone, curative treatment. Larger-scale and more rigorous research with higher methodological quality and adequate control interventions is highly encouraged because yoga may have potential to be implemented as a beneficial supportive/adjunct treatment that is relatively cost-effective, may be practiced at least in part as a self-care behavioral treatment, provides a life-long behavioural skill, enhances self-efficacy and self-confidence and is often associated with additional positive side effects.

22997532	The evolution of mindfulness-based physical interventions in breast cancer survivors.	Survivors of breast cancer are faced with a multitude of medical and psychological impairments during and after treatment and throughout their lifespan. Physical exercise has been shown to improve survival and recurrence in this population. Mind-body interventions combine a light-moderate intensity physical exercise with mindfulness, thus having the potential to improve both physical and psychological sequelae of breast cancer treatments. We conducted a review of mindfulness-based physical exercise interventions which included yoga, tai chi chuan, Pilates, and qigong, in breast cancer survivors. Among the mindfulness-based interventions, yoga was significantly more studied in this population as compared to tai chi chuan, Pilates, and qigong. The participants and the outcomes of the majority of the studies reviewed were heterogeneous, and the population included was generally not selected for symptoms. Yoga was shown to improve fatigue in a few methodologically strong studies, providing reasonable evidence for benefit in this population. Improvements were also seen in sleep, anxiety, depression, distress, quality of life, and postchemotherapy nausea and vomiting in the yoga studies. Tai chi chuan, Pilates, and qigong were not studied sufficiently in breast cancer survivors in order to be implemented in clinical practice.

22993051	The acute effects of yogic breathing exercises on craving and withdrawal symptoms in abstaining smokers.	RATIONALE: Breathing exercises have been proposed as a way of combating cigarette cravings, potentially presenting a low-cost, easily scalable smoking cessation aid. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the acute impact of breathing exercises based on yogic pranayama on cravings in abstaining smokers. METHODS: Participants visited the laboratory on two occasions 24 h apart and were asked to abstain from smoking 12 h prior to the first visit until the end of the second visit. Smokers (N = 96) were randomly allocated to a yogic breathing exercise (YBG) or video control (VCG) group. The former was instructed on breathing exercises, practised these for 10 min and asked to use these when experiencing cravings until the next visit. The latter was shown a breathing exercise video for 10 min and asked to concentrate on their breathing. Strength of urges to smoke, other craving measures and mood and physical symptoms associated with cigarette withdrawal were assessed at the beginning and end of the first visit, and again at the second visit. RESULTS: At immediate follow-up, in the laboratory, all craving measures were reduced in YBG compared with VCG (strength of urges: F(1, 96) = 16.1, p < 0.001; cigarette craving: F(1, 96) = 11.3, p = 0.001; desire to smoke: F(1, 96) = 6.6, p = 0.012). There was no effect on mood or physical symptoms. Adherence to the breathing exercise regimen in the following 24 h was low, and at 24 h follow-up, there was no evidence of reduced cravings in YBG compared with VCG. CONCLUSIONS: Simple yogic-style breathing exercises can reduce cigarette craving acutely in the laboratory. Further research is needed to determine how far this translates into field settings.

22992864	Rural and small town breast cancer survivors' preferences for physical activity.	BACKGROUND: Recent data suggests that only 35 % of rural and small town breast cancer survivors are achieving physical activity (PA) guidelines after treatment. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine preferences for PA counseling and programming and barriers to program participation in a sample of rural and small town breast cancer survivors. METHODS: Survivors (n = 524) residing in rural and small town areas of Alberta, Canada completed a mailed self-report survey that assessed demographic variables, PA, and PA counseling and programming preferences. RESULTS: Seventy-eight percent of survivors indicated they would have possibly (i.e., yes or maybe) been interested in being counseled about PA at the time of diagnosis, while 70 % would possibly be interested in being counseled about PA at this current time. Overall, 85 % felt they would possibly be able to participate in a PA program. Receiving chemotherapy was negatively associated with wanting to receive PA counseling (odds ratio [OR] = 0.58; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.86), PA program interest (OR = 0.43; 95 % CI, 0.28 to 0.67), and PA program ability (OR = 0.44; 95 % CI, 0.26 to 0.75). Preferred activities involved walking (51 %), flexibility and related activities (e.g., yoga, stretching) (36 %), and strength training (27 %). CONCLUSIONS: Rural and small town survivors appear to be interested in and able to participate in PA counseling and programs. PA initiatives targeted to the preferences of breast cancer survivors living in nonurban areas may be more likely to facilitate and maintain PA behavior.

22991569	Effects of yoga interventions on fatigue: a meta-analysis.	Background. Researchers aimed at systematically reviewing and meta-analyzing the effectiveness of yoga interventions for fatigue. Methods. PubMed/Medline was searched until January 2012 for controlled clinical studies. Two reviewers independently extracted the data. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed. A meta-analysis was performed. Results. Nineteen clinical studies (total n = 948) were included in this review. Investigated yoga styles included Hatha, Iyengar, Asanas, Patanjali, Sahaja, and Tibetan yoga. Participants were suffering from cancer, multiple sclerosis, dialysis, chronic pancreatitis, fibromyalgia, asthma, or were healthy. Yoga had a small positive effect on fatigue (SMD = 0.27, 59% CI = 0.23-0.31). Seven studies received 4 points on the Jadad score. There were baseline differences in at least 5 studies. Conclusion. Overall, the effects of yoga interventions on fatigue were only small, particularly in cancer patients. Although yoga is generally a safe therapeutic intervention and effective to attenuate other health-related symptoms, this meta-analysis was not able to define the powerful effect of yoga on patients suffering from fatigue. Treatment effects of yoga could be improved in well-designed future studies. According to the GRADE recommendations assessing the overall quality of evidence, there is a moderate effect of the confidence placed in the estimates of the effects discussed here.

22988934	Yoga for breast cancer patients and survivors: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	BACKGROUND: Many breast cancer patients and survivors use yoga to cope with their disease. The aim of this review was to systematically assess and meta-analyze the evidence for effects of yoga on health-related quality of life and psychological health in breast cancer patients and survivors. METHODS: MEDLINE, PsycInfo, EMBASE, CAMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were screened through February 2012. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing yoga to controls were analyzed when they assessed health-related quality of life or psychological health in breast cancer patients or survivors. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. RESULTS: Twelve RCTs with a total of 742 participants were included. Seven RCTs compared yoga to no treatment; 3 RCTs compared yoga to supportive therapy; 1 RCT compared yoga to health education; and 1 RCT compared a combination of physiotherapy and yoga to physiotherapy alone. Evidence was found for short-term effects on global health-related quality of life (SMD = 0.62 [95% CI: 0.04 to 1.21]; P = 0.04), functional (SMD = 0.30 [95% CI: 0.03 to 0.57), social (SMD = 0.29 [95% CI: 0.08 to 0.50]; P < 0.01), and spiritual well-being (SMD = 0.41 [95% CI: 0.08; 0.74]; P = 0.01). These effects were, however, only present in studies with unclear or high risk of selection bias. Short-term effects on psychological health also were found: anxiety (SMD = -1.51 [95% CI: -2.47; -0.55]; P < 0.01), depression (SMD = -1.59 [95% CI: -2.68 to -0.51]; P < 0.01), perceived stress (SMD = -1.14 [95% CI:-2.16; -0.12]; P = 0.03), and psychological distress (SMD = -0.86 [95% CI:-1.50; -0.22]; P < 0.01). Subgroup analyses revealed evidence of efficacy only for yoga during active cancer treatment but not after completion of active treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review found evidence for short-term effects of yoga in improving psychological health in breast cancer patients. The short-term effects on health-related quality of life could not be clearly distinguished from bias. Yoga can be recommended as an intervention to improve psychological health during breast cancer treatment.	Cramer, Holger;Lange, Silke;Klose, Petra;Paul, Anna;Dobos, Gustav	2012 Sep 18
22987056	Modulation of antioxidant enzyme expression by PTU-induced hypothyroidism in cerebral cortex of postnatal rat brain.	This study aimed to elucidate the effect of 6-n-propylthiouracil (PTU)-induced hypothyroidism on oxidative stress parameters and expression of antioxidant enzymes in cerebral cortex of rat brain during postnatal development. A significant decrease in levels of lipid peroxidation and H(2)O(2) were seen in 7 and 30 days old PTU-treated rats with respect to their controls. Significantly decreased activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) along with the translated products of SOD1 and SOD2 were observed in 7, 15 and 30 days old PTU-treated rats as compared to their respective controls. However, increase in translated product of CAT was seen in all age groups of PTU-treated rats. Glutathione peroxidase activity was decreased in 7 days and increased in 15 days old PTU-treated rats with respect to their control groups. Histological sections clearly show a decline in neuronal migration with neurons packed together in the hypothyroid group as compared to the control.	Bhanja, Shravani;Jena, Srikanta	2013 Jan
22983129	A yoga intervention for music performance anxiety in conservatory students.	Music performance anxiety can adversely affect musicians. There is a need for additional treatment strategies, especially those that might be more acceptable to musicians than existing therapies. This pilot study examined the effectiveness of a 9-week yoga practice on reducing music performance anxiety in undergraduate and graduate music conservatory students, including both vocalists and instrumentalists. The intervention consisted of fourteen 60-minute yoga classes approximately twice a week and a brief daily home practice. Of the 24 students enrolled in the study, 17 attended the post-intervention assessment. Participants who completed the measures at both pre- and post-intervention assessments showed large decreases in music performance anxiety as well as in trait anxiety. Improvements were sustained at 7- to 14-month follow-up. Participants generally provided positive comments about the program and its benefits. This study suggests that yoga is a promising intervention for music performance anxiety in conservatory students and therefore warrants further research.

22978245	The effects of regular yoga practice on pulmonary function in healthy individuals: a literature review.	OBJECTIVES: Yoga is a popular form of exercise in the Western world, and yoga's effects on pulmonary function have been investigated previously. The purpose of this article is to review this research systematically and determine if regular yoga training improves pulmonary function in apparently healthy individuals. METHODS: Using the Alternative Health Watch, the Physical Education Index, Medline,((R)) and the SPORTdiscus databases; and the keywords yoga, respiration, and pulmonary function, a comprehensive search was conducted that yielded 57 studies. Of these studies selections were made to include only experimental studies written in English, published in peer-reviewed journals after 1980, and investigating the effects of regular yoga practice on pulmonary function in healthy individuals participating in the studies. RESULTS: Yoga improved pulmonary function, as measured by maximum inspiratory pressure, maximum expiratory pressure, maximum voluntary ventilation, forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and peak expiratory flow rate, in all (N=9), but 1, study. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, pulmonary function appears to improve with a minimum of 10 weeks of regular yoga practice, and the magnitude of this improvement is related to fitness level and/or the length of time the subjects spend practicing pranayama (i.e., breathing exercises). In other words, greater improvements in pulmonary function are more likely to be seen in less-fit individuals and/or those that engage in longer periods of pranayama. Additional studies examining various yoga practices are warranted to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of yoga techniques on pulmonary functions.

22973410	The physical demands of the tree (vriksasana) and one-leg balance (utthita hasta padangusthasana) poses performed by seniors: a biomechanical examination.	Yoga is considered especially suitable for seniors because poses can be modified to accommodate practitioners' capabilities and limitations. In this study, biomechanical assessments on healthy seniors (n = 20; 70.1 +/- 3.8 yr) were used to quantify the physical demands, (net joint moments of force [JMOFs] and muscular activation in the lower extremities) associated with the performance of 3 variations (introductory, intermediate, advanced) of 2 classical Hatha yoga poses - Tree and One-Leg Balance (OLB). ANOVA and Cohen's-d were used to contrast the postural variations statistically. The advanced (single-limb, without additional support) versions were hypothesized to generate the greatest demands, followed by the intermediate (single-limb [Tree] and bilateral-limb [OLB] with support) and introductory (bilateral-limb) versions. Our findings, however, suggest that common, long-held conceptions about pose modifications can be counter-intuitive. There was no difference between the intermediate and advanced Tree variations regarding hip and knee JMOFs in both the sagittal and frontal planes (P = 0.13-0.98). Similarly, OLB introductory and intermediate variations induced sagittal JMOFs that were in the opposite direction of the classic advanced pose version at the hip and knee (P < .001; d = 0.98-2.36). These biomechanical insights provide evidence that may be used by instructors, clinicians and therapists when selecting pose modifications for their yoga participants.

22972739	Effect of yoga on patients with cancer: our current understanding.	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether therapeutic yoga improves the quality of life of patients with cancer. DATA SOURCES: Search of MEDLINE database (1950-2010) using key words yoga, cancer, and quality of life. STUDY SELECTION: Priority was given to randomized controlled clinical studies conducted to determine the effect of yoga on typical symptoms of patients with cancer in North America. SYNTHESIS: Initially, 4 randomized controlled clinical studies were analyzed, then 2 studies without control groups were analyzed. Three studies conducted in India and the Near East provided interesting information on methodologies. The interventions included yoga sessions of varying length and frequency. The parameters measured also varied among studies. Several symptoms improved substantially with yoga (higher quality of sleep, decrease in symptoms of anxiety and depression, improvement in spiritual well-being, etc). It would appear that quality of life, or some aspects thereof, also improved. CONCLUSION: The variety of benefits derived, the absence of side effects, and the cost-benefit ratio of therapeutic yoga make it an interesting alternative for family physicians to suggest to their patients with cancer. Certain methodologic shortcomings, including the limited size of the samples and varying levels of attendance on the part of the subjects, might have reduced the statistical strength of the studies presented. It is also possible that the measurement scales used did not suit this type of situation and patient population, making it impossible to see a significant effect. However, favourable comments by participants during the studies and their level of appreciation and well-being suggest that further research is called for to fully understand the mechanisms of these effects.

22970982	Use of digital retinal imaging in screening for retinopathy of prematurity.	The frequency of premature births is increasing world-wide. This factor, combined with improved survival and revised screening criteria, is resulting in an increased workload in screening for retinopathy of prematurity. Digital retinal imaging is emerging as an important alternative tool for diagnosing retinopathy of prematurity, and its use has even been extended to developing countries. Neonatal nurses and technicians can be trained to use digital imaging devices effectively. This is important in areas that do not have ready access to paediatric ophthalmologists. The ability to transfer images electronically makes it a valuable tool in telemedicine, while the ability to store and retrieve images is also advantageous from a medico-legal perspective. Image analysis software can further improve the accuracy of diagnosis. The main limitation of this technology is its high capital cost.

22969831	Complementary medicine, exercise, meditation, diet, and lifestyle modification for anxiety disorders: a review of current evidence.	Use of complementary medicines and therapies (CAM) and modification of lifestyle factors such as physical activity, exercise, and diet are being increasingly considered as potential therapeutic options for anxiety disorders. The objective of this metareview was to examine evidence across a broad range of CAM and lifestyle interventions in the treatment of anxiety disorders. In early 2012 we conducted a literature search of PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane Library, for key studies, systematic reviews, and metaanalyses in the area. Our paper found that in respect to treatment of generalized anxiety or specific disorders, CAM evidence revealed current support for the herbal medicine Kava. One isolated study shows benefit for naturopathic medicine, whereas acupuncture, yoga, and Tai chi have tentative supportive evidence, which is hampered by overall poor methodology. The breadth of evidence does not support homeopathy for treating anxiety. Strong support exists for lifestyle modifications including adoption of moderate exercise and mindfulness meditation, whereas dietary improvement, avoidance of caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine offer encouraging preliminary data. In conclusion, certain lifestyle modifications and some CAMs may provide a beneficial role in the treatment of anxiety disorders.

22963270	Effect of yoga on serum homocysteine and nitric oxide levels in adolescent women with and without dysmenorrhea.	BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study is to explore the effect of yoga on the serum levels of homocysteine and nitric oxide (NO) in a cohort of women with primary dysmenorrhea and normal healthy controls. METHODS: A prospective controlled trial was conducted in 35 women with primary dysmenorrhea and 35 healthy controls in a community-based study. Short-form Menstrual Distress Questionnaires (MDQs) were administered to assess the menstrual symptoms. All participants were provided yoga intervention, twice a week at 30 minutes/session, consecutively for 8 weeks. Blood samples were drawn from each woman on the third day of the menstrual cycle. Assessments of MDQs and blood samples for the determination of homocysteine and NO concentrations were performed at baseline and within the first 3 days of their next menses after completion of yoga intervention. RESULTS: A total of 30 women from the dysmenorrheal group and 30 from the control group completed the study. Homocysteine levels were higher in those with dysmenorrhea when compared with healthy controls before yoga intervention (Mann-Whitney U test, p<0.05); however, no statistically significant differences were found between the two groups after 8 weeks of yoga training (p<0.05). The concentrations of homocysteine in both the dysmenorrheal and control groups after 8 weeks decreased by 51.37% and 46.46%, respectively (p<0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in NO levels between the two groups at baseline and after intervention. The total scores on the MDQs decreased significantly after yoga intervention in the dysmenorrheal group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Yoga intervention was found to be associated with reductions in severity of dysmenorrhea and may be effective in lowering serum homocysteine levels after an intervention period of 8 weeks. These observations suggest that yoga may have therapeutic effects in women by restoring endothelial function.	Chien, Li-Wei;Chang, Hui-Chi;Liu, Chi-Feng	2013 Jan
22962637	Mental health nurses in general practice - a personal perspective.	For the past 2 years I have been working as a mental health nurse (MHN) at Lyttleton Street Clinic, a general practice clinic in my hometown of Castlemaine in Victoria. My background is as a general and mental health nurse, more recently in the mental health sector at the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service. I also have postgraduate qualifications in women's health and have recently trained as a yoga teacher. My position at the clinic is supported by the national Mental Health Nurse Incentive Program (MHNIP). The role has proven to be immensely satisfying; I have never felt so useful.

22946453	Changes in autonomic variables following two meditative states described in yoga texts.	OBJECTIVES: In ancient yoga texts there are two meditative states described. One is dharana, which requires focusing, the second is dhyana, during which there is no focusing, but an expansive mental state is reached. While an earlier study did show improved performance in an attention task after dharana, the autonomic changes during these two states have not been studied. METHODS: Autonomic and respiratory variables were assessed in 30 healthy male volunteers (group mean age +/- SD, 29.1 +/- 5.1 years) during four mental states described in traditional yoga texts. These four mental states are random thinking (cancalata), nonmeditative focusing (ekagrata), meditative focusing (dharana), and effortless meditation (dhyana). Assessments were made before (5 minutes), during (20 minutes), and after (5 minutes), each of the four states, on four separate days. RESULTS: During dhyana there was a significant increase in the skin resistance level (p<0.001; post hoc analysis following ANOVA, during compared to pre) and photo-plethysmogram amplitude (p<0.05), whereas there was a significant decrease in the heart rate (p<0.001) and breath rate (p<0.001). There was a significant decrease in the low frequency (LF) power (p<0.001) and increase in the high frequency (HF) power (p<0.001) in the frequency domain analysis of the heart rate variability (HRV) spectrum, on which HF power is associated with parasympathetic activity. There was also a significant increase in the NN50 count (the number of interval differences of successive NN intervals greater than 50 ms; p<0.001) and the pNN50 (the proportion derived by dividing NN50 by the total number of NN intervals; p<0.001) in time domain analysis of HRV, both indicative of parasympathetic activity. CONCLUSIONS: Maximum changes were seen in autonomic variables and breath rate during the state of effortless meditation (dhyana). The changes were all suggestive of reduced sympathetic activity and/or increased vagal modulation. During dharana there was an increase in skin resistance. The changes in HRV during ekagrata and cancalata were inconclusive.

22936306	Mind-body CAM interventions: current status and considerations for integration into clinical health psychology.	OBJECTIVE: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is increasingly used for treating myriad health conditions and for maintaining general health. The present article provides an overview of current CAM use with a specific focus on mind-body CAM and its efficacy in treating health conditions. METHOD: Characteristics of CAM users are presented, and then evidence regarding the efficacy of mind-body treatments (biofeedback, meditation, guided imagery, progressive muscle relaxation, deep breathing, hypnosis, yoga, tai chi, and qi gong) is reviewed. RESULTS: Demographics associated with CAM use are fairly well-established, but less is known about their psychological characteristics. Although the efficacy of mind-body CAM modalities for health conditions is receiving a great deal of research attention, studies have thus far produced a weak base of evidence. Methodological limitations of current research are reviewed. Suggestions are made for future research that will provide more conclusive knowledge regarding efficacy and, ultimately, effectiveness of mind-body CAM. Considerations for clinical applications, including training and competence, ethics, treatment tailoring, prevention efforts, and diversity, conclude the article. CONCLUSIONS: Integration of CAM modalities into clinical health psychology can be useful for researchers taking a broader perspective on stress and coping processes, illness behaviors, and culture; for practitioners seeking to incorporate CAM perspectives into their work; and for policy makers in directing healthcare resources wisely.

22927885	Frequency of yoga practice predicts health: results of a national survey of yoga practitioners.	Background. Yoga shows promise as a therapeutic intervention, but relationships between yoga practice and health are underexplored. Purpose. To examine the relationship between yoga practice and health (subjective well-being, diet, BMI, smoking, alcohol/caffeine consumption, sleep, fatigue, social support, mindfulness, and physical activity). Methods. Cross-sectional, anonymous internet surveys distributed to 4307 randomly selected from 18,160 individuals at 15 US Iyengar yoga studios; 1045 (24.3%) surveys completed. Results. Mean age 51.7 (+/- 11.7) years; 84.2% female. Frequency of home practice favorably predicted (P < .001): mindfulness, subjective well-being, BMI, fruit and vegetable consumption, vegetarian status, sleep, and fatigue. Each component of yoga practice (different categories of physical poses, breath work, meditation, philosophy study) predicted at least 1 health outcome (P < .05). Conclusions. Home practice of yoga predicted health better than years of practice or class frequency. Different physical poses and yoga techniques may have unique health benefits.

22927881	Systematic review of yoga for pregnant women: current status and future directions.	Objectives. Yoga is used for a variety of immunological, neuromuscular, psychological, and pain conditions. Recent studies indicate that it may be effective in improving pregnancy, labour, and birth outcomes. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the existing literature on yoga for pregnancy. Methods. Six databases were searched using the terms "yoga AND pregnancy" and "yoga AND [post-natal OR post-partum]". Trials were considered if they were controlled and evaluated a yoga intervention. All studies were evaluated for methodological quality according to the Jadad scale and the Delphi List. Results. Six trials were identified: three were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and three were controlled trials (CTs). The methodological quality and reporting ranged from 0-5 on the Jadad scale and from 3-6 on the Delphi List. Findings from the RCT studies indicate that yoga may produce improvements in stress levels, quality of life, aspects of interpersonal relating, autonomic nervous system functioning, and labour parameters such as comfort, pain, and duration. Conclusions. The findings suggest that yoga is well indicated for pregnant women and leads to improvements on a variety of pregnancy, labour, and birth outcomes. However, RCTs are needed to provide more information regarding the utility of yoga interventions for pregnancy.	Curtis, Kathryn;Weinrib, Aliza;Katz, Joel	2012
22927272	Exercise associated hyponatraemia leading to tonic-clonic seizure.	A 34-year-old Filipino lady presented to the emergency department with breathlessness and muscle cramping following a Bikram yoga workout. The patient reported sweating excessively while performing 90 min of strenuous exertion in a humidified room heated to an ambient temperature of 40.6 degrees C. After the workout she drank 3.5 litres of water before experiencing breathlessness, severe muscle cramps, nausea and general malaise. Initial investigations revealed severe hyponatraemia (120 mmol/l). Despite early sodium replacement the patient dropped her Glasgow coma scale to 9/15 and developed tonic clonic seizures, requiring intubation and admission to the intensive care unit. The hyponatraemia was slowly corrected on the intensive care unit and the patient made a full recovery over the course of 5 days. This case highlights the dangers of overzealous fluid replacement following severe exertion in a hot environment.	Reynolds, Carl J;Cleaver, Barbara J;Finlay, Sarah E	2012 Aug 27
22923917	Effect of exercise therapy on lipid parameters in patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis.	BACKGROUND: Dyslipidemia has been established as a well-known traditional risk factor for cardiovascular disease in chronic kidney disease patients. AIM: This study investigated the impact of Hatha yoga exercise on lipid parameters in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective randomized study consisted of 33 ESRD patients in the Hatha yoga exercise group that was matched with 35 ESRD patients in the control group. Serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol were determined at baseline (0 month) and after 4 months. RESULTS: Comparing values after 4 months versus baseline in the prehemodialysis Hatha yoga exercise group, there was found a significant decrease in total cholesterol from 5.126 +/- 0.092 mmol/l to 4.891 +/- 0.072 mmol/l (-4.58%; P = 0.0001), triglycerides from 2.699 +/- 0.078 mmol/l to 2.530 +/- 0.063 mmol/l (-6.26%; P = 0.0001), LDL-cholesterol from 2.729 +/- 0.083 mmol/l to 2.420 +/- 0.066 mmol/l (-11.32%; P = 0.0001), and total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio from 5.593 +/- 0.119 mmol/l to 4.907 +/- 0.116 mmol/l (-12.26%; P = 0.047). For patients in the Hatha yoga exercise group, 51.5% had normal total cholesterol at 0 month while 70.0% had normal total cholesterol (P < 0.05) after 4 four months and 54.5% of patients had normal LDL-cholesterol at 0 month while 84.9% had normal LDL-cholesterol after 4 months (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that Hatha yoga exercise has preventive and beneficial effects and may be a safe therapeutic modality in ESRD patients.

22917120	Efficacy of the Get Ready to Learn yoga program among children with autism spectrum disorders: a pretest-posttest control group design.	Occupational therapists use school-based yoga programs, but these interventions typically lack manualization and evidence from well-designed studies. Using an experimental pretest-posttest control group design, we examined the effectiveness of the Get Ready to Learn (GRTL) classroom yoga program among children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The intervention group received the manualized yoga program daily for 16 wk, and the control group engaged in their standard morning routine. We assessed challenging behaviors with standardized measures and behavior coding before and after intervention. We completed a between-groups analysis of variance to assess differences in gain scores on the dependent variables. Students in the GRTL program showed significant decreases (p < .05) in teacher ratings of maladaptive behavior, as measured with the Aberrant Behavior Checklist, compared with the control participants. This study demonstrates that use of daily classroomwide yoga interventions has a significant impact on key classroom behaviors among children with ASD.

22914597	Physical activity and neuropsychiatric symptoms of Parkinson disease.	Neuropsychiatric symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD) such as fatigue, depression, and apathy are common and detract from quality of life. There is little published on the impact of physical activity on the neuropsychiatric symptoms of PD. A convenience sample of 45 patients with PD (mean age = 66.1 years; 33% female) completed questionnaires on physical activity, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and specific exercise preferences. Covarying for age and gender, higher levels of physical activity were associated with significantly less fatigue, as well as a trend for less apathy and depression and greater positive affect. Exercise preferences included moderate intensity (73%), at home (56%), in the morning (73%), scheduled (69%), options for varied activities (73%), and preference for both structured/supervised (50%), and unsupervised/self-paced (50%) programs. Preferred activities included the use of aerobic exercise equipment, resistance training, and yoga. Developing and tailoring exercise programs that incorporate specific preferences may result in more effective interventions for patients with PD.

22909385	The effects of yoga on physical functioning and health related quality of life in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVE: The goal was to review systematically the comparative effectiveness of yoga, compared with other exercise interventions, for older adults as shown on measures of health and physical functioning. DESIGN: This was a systematic review with both narrative synthesis and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Searches were conducted in MEDLINE(R)/PUBMED, PSYCINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, and SCOPUS; bibliographies of selected articles; and one systematic review on the effects of yoga on cardiovascular disease. METHODS: Original studies from 1950 to November 2010 were sought, evaluating the effects of yoga on older adults. The search was restricted to randomized controlled trials of yoga in subjects >/=age 60, and published in English. Data were extracted and evaluated regarding setting, population size and characteristics, intervention type and duration, comparison group, outcome assessment, data analysis, follow-up, key results, and the quality of each study according to specific predetermined criteria. RESULTS: The search yielded 18 eligible studies (N=649). The studies reported on older adults across a range of settings, intervention intensity, and outcome measures. The majority of the studies had<35 participants (range 9-77). Quantitative and qualitative synthesis of the studies suggested that the benefits of yoga may exceed those of conventional exercise interventions for self-rated health status, aerobic fitness, and strength. However, the effect sizes were modest, and the evidence was mixed for yoga's effect on depression, sleep, and bone-mineral density. Studies did not find an effect on cognition. CONCLUSIONS: Small studies with mixed methodological quality suggested that yoga may be superior to conventional physical-activity interventions in elderly people. The precision of the estimates remains low. Larger studies are necessary to define better the intersection of populations, settings, and interventions in which yoga is most beneficial.

22909345	Effects of yoga on psychologic function and quality of life in women with breast cancer: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effects of yoga on psychologic function and quality of life (QoL) in women with breast cancer. DESIGN: A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and the Chinese Digital Journals Full-text Database was carried out. Randomized control trials (RCTs) examining the effects of yoga, versus a control group receiving no intervention, on psychologic functioning and QoL in women with breast cancer were included. Methodological quality of included RCTs was assessed according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 5.0.1, and data were analyzed using the Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager 5.1. RESULTS: Six (6) studies involving 382 patients were included. The meta-analysis showed that yoga can improve QoL for women with breast cancer. A statistically significant effect favoring yoga for the outcome of QoL was found (standard mean difference=0.27, 95% confidence interval [0.02, 0.52], p=0.03). Although the effects of yoga on psychologic function outcomes--such as anxiety, depression, distress and sleep--were in the expected direction, these effects were not statistically significant (p>0.05). Fatigue showed no significant difference (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The present data provided little indication of how effective yoga might be when they were applied by women with breast cancer except for mildly effective in QOL improvement. The findings were based on a small body of evidence in which methodological quality was not high. Further well-designed RCTs with large sample size are needed to clarify the utility of yoga practice for this population.	Zhang, Jun;Yang, Ke-hu;Tian, Jin-hui;Wang, Chun-mei	2012 Nov
22909321	Effect of yoga on cognitive abilities in schoolchildren from a socioeconomically disadvantaged background: a randomized controlled study.	OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the effect of yoga, compared to physical activity on the cognitive performance in 7-9 year-old schoolchildren from a socioeconomic disadvantaged background. DESIGN: Two hundred (200) schoolchildren from Bangalore, India, after baseline assessment of cognitive functioning were randomly allocated to either a yoga or a physical-activity group. Cognitive functions (attention and concentration, visuo-spatial abilities, verbal ability, and abstract thinking) were assessed using an Indian adaptation of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children at baseline, after 3 months of intervention, and later at a 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 200 subjects, 193 were assessed at 3 months after the study, and then 180 were assessed at the 3-month follow-up. There were no significant differences in cognitive performance between the two study groups (yoga versus physical activity) at postintervention, after controlling for grade levels. Improvement in the mean scores of cognitive tests following intervention varied from 0.5 (Arithmetic) to 1.4 (Coding) for the yoga group and 0.7 (Arithmetic) to 1.6 (Vocabulary) in the physical-activity group. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga was as effective as physical activity in improving cognitive performance in 7-9 year old schoolchildren. Further studies are needed to examine the dose-response relationship between yoga and cognitive performance.

22905985	An integrative medicine approach to asthma: who responds?	OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to develop a better understanding of which patients with chronic illness tend to respond to integrative medicine interventions, by identifying a set of characteristics or qualities that are associated with a positive outcome in a randomized clinical trial of an integrative medicine approach to asthma that incorporated journaling, yoga breathing instruction, and nutritional manipulation and supplementation. DESIGN: The study used qualitative analysis using a grounded-theory approach comparing a group of responders in the parent trial (based on the Asthma Quality of Life Scale) to a group of nonresponders. RESULTS: Twelve (12) responders and 8 nonresponders were interviewed. Responders demonstrated an attitude of "change as challenge;" a view of themselves as "independent" and "leaders;" an ability to accept one's illness while still maintaining a feeling of control over one's choices; a connection to the deeper context or meaning of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interventions, as opposed to just "previous experience" of CAM; and a sense of determination, commitment, and "willingness to fight" for what one needs from the health care system. Nonresponders were more often uncertain and anxious in their relationship to their asthma, tending to fall back on denial, and lacking a connection to the deeper context or philosophy of CAM interventions. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to identify a set of characteristics that may predict a positive response to an integrative/lifestyle approach to asthma. These characteristics should be examined prospectively using both quantitative and qualitative methods in future integrative medicine clinical trials.

22902090	Mind-body medicine therapies for a range of depression severity: a systematic review.	OBJECTIVE: Of the 34 million adult Americans (17%) using mind-body medicine therapies, 8 million (24%) have anxiety/depression. The evidence for using mind-body therapies to address varying depressive symptoms in populations with and without other chronic comorbidities is reviewed. METHODS: Systematic literature searches of PubMed (Medline), Embase, CINAHL, and the seven databases encompassed by Current Contents, Web of Science, and Web of Knowledge were conducted. Studies designed as prospective control-comparison, adult population, English, at least 2 weeks long, sample size >30, and with primary or secondary outcome as depression measured on an established scale were included. Methodologic quality was evaluated using the modified scale for assessing scientific quality of investigations (SASQI) for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM). RESULTS: Ninety papers of about 2900 met both inclusion and exclusion criteria; 60% of them scored a SASQI >9 and were deemed of sufficient quality to be included in the review; 74% of these selected quality papers demonstrated positive effects on the improvement of depressive symptoms. All mind-body modalities included in the study had at least one positive study. For cancer patients, several studies noted the positive effects of yoga and combination therapies on depression severity. For both diagnosed depression and fibromyalgia, several studies noted the positive effects of mindfulness on depression severity. CONCLUSION: The use of evidence-based mind-body therapies can alleviate depression severity. They could be used with established psychiatric treatments of therapy and medications. The likely long-term increased cost-effectiveness of integrating these therapies deserves further investigation.

22897098	Performance in a substitution task and state anxiety following yoga in army recruits.	140 men (M age = 30.3 yr., SD = 5.7) from the Indian army in north India participated in the study. They were naive to yoga and were assigned to yoga and breath awareness groups randomly, with 70 in each group. 20 healthy males of comparable age (M age = 33.7 yr., SD = 7.0) formed a comparison group. Their performance in a digit-letter substitution task and a state anxiety subscale was assessed immediately before and after two 45-min. sessions. The two groups of soldiers practiced either yoga or breath awareness. The comparison group listened to meditation music. Digit-letter substitution scores increased in both groups of army personnel and in the comparison group. State anxiety decreased after yoga and listening to meditation music, but not after breath awareness. This suggests that even in army personnel naive to yoga, a yoga-based intervention or listening to meditation music could reduce anxiety while increasing performance on an attention task.

22895974	Exercise interventions on health-related quality of life for people with cancer during active treatment.	BACKGROUND: People with cancer undergoing active treatment experience numerous disease- and treatment-related adverse outcomes and poorer health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Exercise interventions are hypothesized to alleviate these adverse outcomes. HRQoL and its domains are important measures of cancer survivorship, both during and after the end of active treatment for cancer. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of exercise on overall HRQoL outcomes and specific HRQoL domains among adults with cancer during active treatment. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PEDRO, LILACS, SIGLE, SportDiscus, OTSeeker, Sociological Abstracts from inception to November 2011 with no language or date restrictions. We also searched citations through Web of Science and Scopus, PubMed's related article feature, and several websites. We reviewed reference lists of included trials and other reviews in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing exercise interventions with usual care or other type of non-exercise comparison intervention to maintain or enhance, or both, overall HRQoL or at least one distinct domain of HRQoL. Included trials tested exercise interventions that were initiated when adults with cancer were undergoing active cancer treatment or were scheduled to initiate treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Five paired review authors independently extracted information on characteristics of included trials, data on effects of the intervention, and assessed risk of bias based on predefined criteria. Where possible, we performed meta-analyses for HRQoL and HRQoL domains for the reported difference between baseline values and follow-up values using standardized mean differences (SMDs) and a random-effects model by length of follow-up. We also reported the SMD at follow-up between the exercise and control groups. Because investigators used many different HRQoL and HRQoL domain instruments and often more than one for the same domain, we selected the more commonly used instrument to include in the SMD meta-analyses. We also report the mean difference for each type of instrument separately. MAIN RESULTS: We included 56 trials with 4826 participants randomized to an exercise (n = 2286) or comparison (n = 1985) group. Cancer diagnoses in trial participants included breast, prostate, gynecologic, hematologic, and other. Thirty-six trials were conducted among participants who were currently undergoing active treatment for their cancer, 10 trials were conducted among participants both during and post active cancer treatment, and the remaining 10 trials were conducted among participants scheduled for active cancer treatment. Mode of exercise intervention differed across trials and included walking by itself or in combination with cycling, resistance training, or strength training; resistance training; strength training; cycling; yoga; or Qigong. HRQoL and its domains were assessed using a wide range of measures.The results suggest that exercise interventions compared with control interventions have a positive impact on overall HRQoL and certain HRQoL domains. Exercise interventions resulted in improvements in: HRQoL from baseline to 12 weeks' follow-up (SMD 0.33; 95% CI 0.12 to 0.55) or when comparing difference in follow-up scores at 12 weeks (SMD 0.47; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.79); physical functioning from baseline to 12 weeks' follow-up (SMD 0.69; 95% CI 0.16 to 1.22) or 6 months (SMD 0.28; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.55); or when comparing differences in follow-up scores at 12 weeks (SMD 0.28; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.45) or 6 months (SMD 0.29; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.50); role function from baseline to 12 weeks' follow-up (SMD 0.48; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.90) or when comparing differences in follow-up scores at 12 weeks (SMD 0.17; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.34) or 6 months (SMD 0.32; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.61); and, in social functioning at 12 weeks' follow-up (SMD 0.54; 95% CI 0.03 to 1.05) or when comparing differences in follow-up scores at both 12 weeks (SMD 0.16; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.27) and 6 months (SMD 0.24; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.44). Further, exercise interventions resulted in a decrease in fatigue from baseline to 12 weeks' follow-up (SMD -0.38; 95% CI -0.57 to -0.18) or when comparing difference in follow-up scores at follow-up of 12 weeks (SMD -0.73; 95% CI -1.14 to -0.31). Since there is consistency of findings on both types of measures (change scores and difference in follow-up scores) there is greater confidence in the robustness of these findings.When examining exercise effects by subgroups, exercise interventions had significantly greater reduction in anxiety for survivors with breast cancer than those with other types of cancer. Further, there was greater reduction in depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbances, and improvement in HRQoL, emotional wellbeing (EWB), physical functioning, and role function for cancer survivors diagnosed with cancers other than breast cancer but not for breast cancer. There were also greater improvements in HRQoL and physical functioning, and reduction in anxiety, fatigue, and sleep disturbances when prescribed a moderate or vigorous versus a mild exercise program.Results of the review need to be interpreted cautiously owing to the risk of bias. All the trials reviewed were at high risk for performance bias. In addition, the majority of trials were at high risk for detection, attrition, and selection bias. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review indicates that exercise may have beneficial effects at varying follow-up periods on HRQoL and certain HRQoL domains including physical functioning, role function, social functioning, and fatigue. Positive effects of exercise interventions are more pronounced with moderate- or vigorous-intensity versus mild-intensity exercise programs. The positive results must be interpreted cautiously because of the heterogeneity of exercise programs tested and measures used to assess HRQoL and HRQoL domains, and the risk of bias in many trials. Further research is required to investigate how to sustain positive effects of exercise over time and to determine essential attributes of exercise (mode, intensity, frequency, duration, timing) by cancer type and cancer treatment for optimal effects on HRQoL and its domains.

22895961	Exercise interventions on health-related quality of life for cancer survivors.	BACKGROUND: Cancer survivors experience numerous disease and treatment-related adverse outcomes and poorer health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Exercise interventions are hypothesized to alleviate these adverse outcomes. HRQoL and its domains are important measures for cancer survivorship. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of exercise on overall HRQoL and HRQoL domains among adult post-treatment cancer survivors. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PEDRO, LILACS, SIGLE, SportDiscus, OTSeeker, and Sociological Abstracts from inception to October 2011 with no language or date restrictions. We also searched citations through Web of Science and Scopus, PubMed's related article feature, and several websites. We reviewed reference lists of included trials and other reviews in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) comparing exercise interventions with usual care or other nonexercise intervention to assess overall HRQoL or at least one HRQoL domain in adults. Included trials tested exercise interventions that were initiated after completion of active cancer treatment. We excluded trials including people who were terminally ill, or receiving hospice care, or both, and where the majority of trial participants were undergoing active treatment for either the primary or recurrent cancer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Five paired review authors independently extracted information on characteristics of included trials, data on effects of the intervention, and assessed risk of bias based on predefined criteria. Where possible, meta-analyses results were performed for HRQoL and HRQoL domains for the reported difference between baseline values and follow-up values using standardized mean differences (SMD) and a random-effects model by length of follow-up. We also reported the SMDs between mean follow-up values of exercise and control group. Because investigators used many different HRQoL and HRQoL domain instruments and often more than one for the same domain, we selected the more commonly used instrument to include in the SMD meta-analyses. We also report the mean difference for each type of instrument separately. MAIN RESULTS: We included 40 trials with 3694 participants randomized to an exercise (n = 1927) or comparison (n = 1764) group. Cancer diagnoses in study participants included breast, colorectal, head and neck, lymphoma, and other. Thirty trials were conducted among participants who had completed active treatment for their primary or recurrent cancer and 10 trials included participants both during and post cancer treatment. Mode of the exercise intervention included strength training, resistance training, walking, cycling, yoga, Qigong, or Tai Chi. HRQoL and its domains were measured using a wide range of measures.The results suggested that exercise compared with control has a positive impact on HRQoL and certain HRQoL domains. Exercise resulted in improvement in: global HRQoL at 12 weeks' (SMD 0.48; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.81) and 6 months' (0.46; 95% CI 0.09 to 0.84) follow-up, breast cancer concerns between 12 weeks' and 6 months' follow-up (SMD 0.99; 95% CI 0.41 to 1.57), body image/self-esteem when assessed using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem scale at 12 weeks (MD 4.50; 95% CI 3.40 to 5.60) and between 12 weeks' and 6 months' (mean difference (MD) 2.70; 95% CI 0.73 to 4.67) follow-up, emotional well-being at 12 weeks' follow-up (SMD 0.33; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.61), sexuality at 6 months' follow-up (SMD 0.40; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.68), sleep disturbance when comparing follow-up values by comparison group at 12 weeks' follow-up (SMD -0.46; 95% CI -0.72 to -0.20), and social functioning at 12 weeks' (SMD 0.45; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.87) and 6 months' (SMD 0.49; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.87) follow-up. Further, exercise interventions resulted in decreased anxiety at 12 weeks' follow-up (SMD -0.26; 95% CI -0.07 to -0.44), fatigue at 12 weeks' (SMD -0.82; 95% CI -1.50 to -0.14) and between 12 weeks' and 6 months' (SMD -0.42; 95% CI -0.02 to -0.83) follow-up, and pain at 12 weeks' follow-up (SMD -0.29; 95% CI -0.55 to -0.04) when comparing follow-up values by comparison group.Positive trends and impact of exercise intervention existed for depression and body image (when analyzing combined instruments); however, because few studies measured these outcomes the robustness of findings is uncertain.No conclusions can be drawn regarding the effects of exercise interventions on HRQoL domains of cognitive function, physical functioning, general health perspective, role function, and spirituality.Results of the review need to be interpreted cautiously owing to the risk of bias. All the trials reviewed were at high risk for performance bias. In addition, the majority of trials were at high risk for detection, attrition, and selection bias. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review indicates that exercise may have beneficial effects on HRQoL and certain HRQoL domains including cancer-specific concerns (e.g. breast cancer), body image/self-esteem, emotional well-being, sexuality, sleep disturbance, social functioning, anxiety, fatigue, and pain at varying follow-up periods. The positive results must be interpreted cautiously due to the heterogeneity of exercise programs tested and measures used to assess HRQoL and HRQoL domains, and the risk of bias in many trials. Further research is required to investigate how to sustain positive effects of exercise over time and to determine essential attributes of exercise (mode, intensity, frequency, duration, timing) by cancer type and cancer treatment for optimal effects on HRQoL and its domains.

22894892	Effect of laughter yoga on mood and heart rate variability in patients awaiting organ transplantation: a pilot study.	CONTEXT: Research shows that laughter has myriad health benefits, yet the medical community has not implemented it formally as a treatment. Patients awaiting organ transplantation have significant physical disabilities and are at risk for psychological distress. Attenuated heart rate variability (HRV) is a risk factor for a negative long-term outcome in some patients. OBJECTIVE: The study intended to evaluate the clinical utility of laughter yoga in improving psychological and physiological measures in outpatients awaiting organ transplantation. Positive results would indicate promising areas to pursue in a follow-up study. DESIGN: Six participants met for 10 sessions over 4 weeks. The research team measured each participant's heart rate, HRV, blood pressure (BP), and immediate mood before and after the laughter and control interventions. The team assessed participants' longer-term mood (anxiety and depression) at the study's initiation, after a no-treatment control week, and at the end of the study. SETTING: The study occurred at the Department of Surgery and Medicine at the University of Arizona Health Sciences Center, Tucson. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were patients awaiting transplants (three heart and three lung), two women and four men (ages 51-69 y). Participants had received no major surgery in the 3 months prior to the intervention, did not have a hernia or uncontrolled hypertension, and did not fall into the New York Heart Association function class 4. INTERVENTION: The 20-minute laughter intervention involved breathing and stretching exercises, simulated laughter (ie, unconditional laughter that is not contingent on the environment), chanting, clapping, and a meditation. The 20-minute control intervention involved the study's personnel discussing health and study-related topics with the participants. OUTCOME MEASURES: The research team measured BP, heart rate, and HRV and administered the Profile of Mood States, Beck Anxiety Inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory-II to evaluate immediate and longer-term mood. The team had planned quantitative statistical analysis of the data at the study's initiation but did not complete it because the number of enrolled participants was too low for the analysis to be meaningful. The team visually examined the data, however, for trends that would indicate areas to examine further in a follow-up study. RESULTS: Participants showed improved immediate mood (vigor-activity and friendliness) and increased HRV after the laughter intervention. Both the laughter and control interventions appeared to improve longer-term anxiety. Two participants awaiting a lung transplant dropped out of the study, and no adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that laughter yoga may improve HRV and some aspects of mood, and this topic warrants further research.

22894891	The effects of yoga on psychosocial variables and exercise adherence: a randomized, controlled pilot study.	BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is a serious issue for the American public. Because of conditions that result from inactivity, individuals incur close to $1 trillion USD in health-care costs, and approximately 250 000 premature deaths occur per year. Researchers have linked engaging in yoga to improved overall fitness, including improved muscular strength, muscular endurance, flexibility, and balance. Researchers have not yet investigated the impact of yoga on exercise adherence. OBJECTIVE: The research team assessed the effects of 10 weeks of yoga classes held twice a week on exercise adherence in previously sedentary adults. DESIGN: The research team designed a randomized controlled pilot trial. The team collected data from the intervention (yoga) and control groups at baseline, midpoint, and posttest (posttest 1) and also collected data pertaining to exercise adherence for the yoga group at 5 weeks posttest (posttest 2). SETTING: The pilot took place in a yoga studio in central New Jersey in the United States. The pretesting occurred at the yoga studio for all participants. Midpoint testing and posttesting occurred at the studio for the yoga group and by mail for the control group. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 27 adults (mean age 51 y) who had been physically inactive for a period of at least 6 months prior to the study. Interventions The intervention group (yoga group) received hour-long hatha yoga classes that met twice a week for 10 weeks. The control group did not participate in classes during the research study; however, they were offered complimentary post research classes. Outcome Measures The study's primary outcome measure was exercise adherence as measured by the 7-day Physical Activity Recall. The secondary measures included (1) exercise self-efficacy as measured by the Multidimensional Self-Efficacy for Exercise Scale, (2) general well-being as measured by the General Well-Being Schedule, (3) exercise-group cohesion as measured by the Group Environment Questionnaire (GEQ), (4) acute feeling response as measured by the Exercise-induced Feeling Inventory (EFI), and (5) two open-ended questions coded for emerging themes and subcategories. RESULTS: The analysis revealed that the yoga group's mean hours of physical activity at 10 weeks reflected a significant increase in exercise adherence from baseline (P < .012) and a significant difference from the control group (P < .004). At 5 weeks post-intervention, no significant change had occurred in the yoga group's exercise adherence (P = .906). Exercise self-efficacy changed significantly from baseline to midpoint (P < .029). The general wellbeing data demonstrated a significant interaction effect (P < .001), resulting from an increase in general well-being in the intervention group and a decrease in general well-being in the control group. In addition, the yoga group's cohesion score was consistent with the norms on two constructs of the GEQ: Attraction to Group Task and Group Integration Task. The EFI revealed that the yoga participants "felt strongly" that their experiences in yoga were peaceful, happy, upbeat, and enthusiastic and that they felt revived following the yoga classes. Qualitative analysis of data revealed self-reported improvements in exercise behaviors, stress management, and eating habits. CONCLUSIONS: Ten weeks of yoga classes twice a week significantly increased previously inactive participants' adherence to physical activity. Additionally, the findings suggest that a mind-body exercise program may be an effective intervention in the fight against physical inactivity.

22893537	[The importance of movement-directed interventions in the multidisciplinary treatment of binge eating disorder: an overview].	BACKGROUND: More than three out of four persons with binge eating disorder do not get enough physical exercise. AIM: To collect scientific evidence of the effects and benefits that movement and physical exercise can have on persons with a binge eating disorder. METHOD: PubMed, PsychInfo, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Library, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, the Dutch Journal of Psychiatry (Tijdschrift voor Psychiatrie), het Tijdschrift voor Vaktherapie and Actual Themata derived from psychomotor therapy were screened for the period January 1994 to August 2011. The methodological quality of the studies was determined on the basis of a checklist. Evidence for the effectiveness of the interventions was summarised by best-evidence synthesis. RESULTS: Eight studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Strong evidence was found for: 1) significant weight-loss after movement interventions; 2) fewer symptoms of depression after a combination of both movement and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) than after CBT on its own. There was only limited evidence for 1) the fact that the combination of movement and CBT leads to less eating disorder pathology than does CBT alone; 2) the beneficial effects of yoga on weight-loss as well as on the reduction of eating disorder pathology.There are indications that walking can be helpful in reducing of eating disorder pathology. CONCLUSIONS: Activities involving movement and physical exercise deserve to play an important role in the multidisciplinary treatment of binge eating disorders.

22891145	Health Impacts of Yoga and Pranayama: A State-of-the-Art Review.	Thousands of years ago yoga originated in India, and in present day and age, an alarming awareness was observed in health and natural remedies among people by yoga and pranayama which has been proven an effective method for improving health in addition to prevention and management of diseases. With increasing scientific research in yoga, its therapeutic aspects are also being explored. Yoga is reported to reduce stress and anxiety, improves autonomic functions by triggering neurohormonal mechanisms by the suppression of sympathetic activity, and even, now-a-days, several reports suggested yoga is beneficial for physical health of cancer patients. Such global recognition of yoga also testifies to India's growing cultural influence.	Sengupta, Pallav	2012 Jul
22884667	The effects of yoga in prevention of pregnancy complications in high-risk pregnancies: a randomized controlled trial.	OBJECTIVE: While previous studies have shown the potential effects of yoga in normal pregnancies, this randomized controlled trial investigated the effects of yoga in prevention of pregnancy complications in high-risk pregnancies for the first time. METHODS: 68 high-risk pregnant women were recruited from two maternity hospitals in Bengaluru, India and were randomized into yoga and control groups. The yoga group (n=30) received standard care plus one-hour yoga sessions, three times a week, from the 12th to the 28th week of gestation. The control group (n=38) received standard care plus conventional antenatal exercises (walking) during the same period. RESULTS: Significantly fewer pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH), preeclampsia, gestational diabetes (GDM) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) cases were observed in the yoga group (p=0.018, 0.042, 0.049, 0.05 respectively). Significantly fewer Small for Gestational Age (SGA) babies and newborns with low APGAR scores (p=0.006) were born in the yoga group (p=0.033). CONCLUSION: This first randomized study of yoga in high-risk pregnancy has shown that yoga can potentially be an effective therapy in reducing hypertensive related complications of pregnancy and improving fetal outcomes. Additional data is needed to confirm these results and better explain the mechanism of action of yoga in this important area.

22875560	Yoga and exercise for symptoms of depression and anxiety in people with poststroke disability: a randomized, controlled pilot trial.	CONTEXT: Mood disorders are prevalent in people after stroke, and a disorder's onset can exacerbate stroke-related disabilities. While evidence supports the mental-health benefits of participation in exercise and yoga, it is unknown whether such benefits extend to a population with poststroke hemiparesis. OBJECTIVE: The study investigated whether supplementing exercise with participation in a yoga program would provide further improvements in self-reported symptoms of depression and anxiety in a chronic poststroke population, and it also assessed trial feasibility for future studies. DESIGN: The research team designed a randomized, controlled pilot trial that included an exercise-only group (EX, control) and a yoga-and-exercise group (YEX, intervention). SETTING: The study took place at the Centre for Physical Activity in Ageing an exercise rehabilitation and activity center at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in South Australia. PARTICIPANTS: The participants included 14 individuals with chronic poststroke hemiparesis: eight in the intervention group and six in the control group. INTERVENTIONS: The YEX group participated in a 6-week standardized program that included yoga in weekly group sessions and home practice in addition to exercise in a weekly group class. The EX group participated only in the group exercise class weekly for 6 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: The research team assessed self-reported symptoms of depression using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS15) and symptoms of anxiety and negative affect using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The team based the feasibility evaluation on recruitment outcomes, retention of participants, participants' compliance with the intervention program, and the safety of the intervention. RESULTS: Changes in depression and state and trait anxiety did not significantly differ between intervention groups (GDS15 P=.749, STAI-Y1, P=.595, STAI-Y2, P=.407). Comparison of individuals' case results indicated clinically relevant improvements in both groups, although members of the intervention group had greater improvements. Participants reported no adverse events, and the study experienced high retention of participants and high compliance in the yoga program. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study provides preliminary data on the effects of yoga combined with exercise to influence mood poststroke. It is a feasible, safe, and acceptable intervention, and the field requires additional investigations with a larger sample size.	Chan, Weili;Immink, Maarten A;Hillier, Susan	2012 May-Jun

22870001	The influence of a yoga exercise program for young adults with intellectual disabilities.	BACKGROUND: Individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID) have an increased risk of obesity and are significantly less likely to engage in physical activity compared to their nondisabled peers. A growing body of research supports the physical and mental health benefits of yoga. While the benefits of yoga have been studied across a host of populations with varying ages and physical disabilities, no studies could be identified investigating the benefits of yoga for young adults with ID. AIMS: This study investigated the impact of participating in yoga classes on the amount of exercise behavior and perception of physical exertion when compared to non-structured exercise sessions between two young adults with ID in a post-secondary education setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single subject multiple baseline research design was implemented across two young adults with mild ID to determine the effects of a yoga exercise class on frequency of exercise behavior and perception of physical exertion when compared to non-structured exercise sessions. Partial interval recording, the Eston-Parfitt curvilinear rating of perceived exertion scale, and the physical activity enjoyment scale were implemented to collect data on dependent variables and consumer satisfaction during each non-structured exercise session and each yoga class. RESULTS: indicated that percentage of exercise behavior and perceived exertion levels during yoga group exercise sharply increased with large effect sizes when compared to non-structured exercise sessions.

22870000	Safety and feasibility of modified chair-yoga on functional outcome among elderly at risk for falls.	Falls are among the most common problems affecting older adults. At least 50% of those over the age of 80 fall annually. The goal of this pilot study was to assess the safety and feasibility of structured yoga in an elderly population with fall risk. Seniors at risk for falls were identified and enrolled in a single arm pilot trial. A chair based yoga program was provided twice a week for 8 weeks. The program was designed from previously published pilot data. A battery of validated instruments was administered at baseline and week eight and was used to identify which instruments may be sensitive to change as a result of a yoga program. Among sixteen seniors (median age of 88) with a previous history of falls, 87% provided data for assessment at the end of the intervention. Two patients withdrew, one due to a fall outside the institution and the other due to lack of time and interest. There were no adverse events during the yoga sessions. Paired-t tests compared pre-post changes and gains were noted in Fear of Falling (5.27 to 2.60; P = 0.029) and SPPB sit to stand subscale (0.31 to 1.00; P =.022). Improved trends were noted in anxiety and the timed up and go assessments. We found the modified chair-yoga program is safe and recruitment is feasible. Our data suggests that yoga may be beneficial in improving mobility and reducing fear of falling which warrants additional research via randomized controlled trial.

22869999	Protracted parahippocampal activity associated with Sean Harribance.	AIMS: Previous research published by Venkatasubramanian et al. (2008) in this journal showed markedly enhanced functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity within the right parahippocampal region of a gifted person while he experienced accurate telepathic impression. The present research is designed to discern if Sean Harribance, a reliable psychic who reported independently verified accurate histories of others during his intuitive state, would also show similar enhancement as measured by standardized low resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA). MATERIALS AND METHODS AND RESULTS: The raw data from the unique electroencephalographic pattern displayed by Sean Harribance (the Harribance configuration) during his intuitive state revealed a peak increase of power within the upper beta range (20-30 Hz) within the right parahippocampal region only. CONCLUSIONS: The congruence of the region of activation during "telepathy" by Sean Harribance and Gerard Senehi, especially when the specific electromagnetic and cellular characteristics are considered, suggests the parahippocampal region may be a focus for exploration of the mechanisms by which these phenomena might occur.

22869998	A short-term, comprehensive, yoga-based lifestyle intervention is efficacious in reducing anxiety, improving subjective well-being and personality.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of a short-term comprehensive yoga-based lifestyle intervention in reducing anxiety, improving subjective well-being and personality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study is a part of an ongoing larger study at a tertiary care hospital. Participants (n=90) included patients with chronic diseases attending a 10-day, yoga-based lifestyle intervention program for prevention and management of chronic diseases, and healthy controls (n=45) not attending any such intervention. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in state and trait anxiety questionnaire (STAI-Y; 40 items), subjective well-being inventory (SUBI; 40 items), and neuroticism extraversion openness to experience five factor personality inventory revised (NEO-FF PI-R; 60 items) at the end of intervention. RESULTS: Following intervention, the STAI-Y scores reduced significantly (P<0.001) at Day 10 (66.7 +/- 13.0) versus Day 1 (72.5 +/- 14.7). Also, positive SUBI scores (F1- F6) improved significantly (P<0.01) at Day 10 versus Day 1. Similarly NEO-FF PI-R scores improved significantly (P<0.001) at Day 10 versus Day 1. Control group showed an increase in STAI-Y while SUBI and NEO-FF PI-R scores remained comparable at Day 10 versus Day 1. CONCLUSIONS: The observations suggest that a short-term, yoga-based lifestyle intervention may significantly reduce anxiety and improve subjective well-being and personality in patients with chronic diseases.

22869997	A comparative study of the effects of yoga and swimming on pulmonary functions in sedentary subjects.	CONTEXT: The modality of exercise that is most beneficial and easy to perform has become a topic of research. Yogic exercises are being widely studied; however, postulated benefits of yogic exercises over other exercises must be scientifically explored. Prospective randomized comparative studies involving yoga and other endurance exercises are conspicuous by their absence. AIM: This study was, therefore, designed to assess and compare the effects of yogic training and swimming on pulmonary functions in normal healthy young volunteers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 100 volunteers were inducted into the study and randomly divided into two groups: One group underwent 12 weeks training for yogic exercises and other for swimming. The training and data acquisition was done in small cohorts of 10 subjects each. The subjects were assessed by studying their anthropometric parameters and pulmonary function parameters (FVC, FEV1/FVC ratio, PEFR, FEF25-75%, FEF 0.2-1.2 l and MVV) both before and after training. RESULTS: All parameters showed statistically significant improvements after both yoga and swimming. Comparison of these improvements for different parameters statistically analyzed by unpaired t test or Mann Whitney U test depicted a statistically better improvement in FVC, FEF25-75% and MVV with swimming as compared to yogic exercises. CONCLUSIONS: The output of this study gives slight edge to swimming as a preferred modality of exercise though either yoga or swimming can be advocated as an exercise prescription as both the modalities cause significant improvement of respiratory health. However, other factors like ability of any exercise regime to keep continued motivation and interest of the trainees must be taken into account for exercise prescription.

22869996	Study of the effect of yoga training on diffusion capacity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients: A controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Patients of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at high risk for depression and anxiety. Yoga techniques are suited for promoting relaxation, psycho-emotional stability and exercise tolerance. Studies showing the effect of yoga in diffusion capacity are not available; hence this study was planned. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted on 60 diagnosed stable mild-to-moderate COPD patients in the age group of 30-60 years, of either sex, in the department of physiology. Patients were taken from Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Delhi and divided into two groups: Control and the yoga group. Both the groups were on conventional drug therapy. Subjects from the Yoga group was called to cardiopulmonary laboratory daily for 21 days and then weekly for the compliance. Yoga instructor taught them the technique of pranayama and various postures every day. They practiced yoga at home for 2 months for 45 min in the mornings. Diffusion capacity was recorded by using computerized Medisoft instrument (HYPAIR compact), in both the groups before and after 2 months. RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed significant improvement in TLCO of the yoga group. Transfer factor of lung for carbon monoxide i.e. TLCO in mild COPD increased from 17.61 +/- 4.55 to 19.08 +/- 5.09 ml/mmHg/min, and in moderate COPD it increased from 14.99 +/- 4.02 to17.35 +/- 3.97 ml/mmHg/min. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that yogic breathing exercises improve diffusion capacity. They are beneficial to COPD patients and they can be used as an adjunct therapy with the conventional medical therapy.	Soni, Ritu;Munish, Kanika;Singh, Kp;Singh, Savita	2012 Jul
22869995	Comparative study of conventional therapy and additional yogasanas for knee rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty.	BACKGROUND: Amongst various modalities of post operative rehabilitation in a total knee replacement (TKR) surgery, this study focuses on evaluating the effect of additional yoga therapy on functional outcome of TKR patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comparative study was done to compare the effects of conventional physiotherapy and additional yoga asanas, on 56 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty due to osteoarthritis. After obtaining written informed consent, the patients were alternately assigned to two groups: Conventional and experimental. Baseline WOMAC scores for pain and stiffness were taken on third post operative day. The subjects in conventional group received physiotherapy rehabilitation program of Sancheti Institute where the study was conducted, the experimental group received additional modified yoga asanas once daily by the therapist. After discharge from the hospital, patients were provided with written instructions and photographs of the asanas, two sets of WOMAC questionnaire with stamped and addressed envelopes and were instructed to perform yoga asanas 3 days/week. Subjects filled the questionnaire after 6 weeks and 3 months from the day of surgery and mailed back. The primary outcome measure was WOMAC questionnaire which consists of 24 questions, each corresponding to a visual analog scale, designed to measure patient's perception of pain, stiffness and function. RESULTS: The results suggest that there was a significant change (P<0.05) for all the groups for pain, stiffness and function subscales of WOMAC scale. The pain and stiffness was found to be less in experimental group receiving additional yoga therapy than in conventional group on 3(rd) post operative day, 6 weeks and 3 months after the surgery. CONCLUSION: A combination of physiotherapy and yoga asana protocol works better than only physiotherapy protocol. Larger and blinded study is needed.

22869994	Effect of holistic yoga program on anxiety symptoms in adolescent girls with polycystic ovarian syndrome: A randomized control trial.	CONTEXT: Yoga techniques practiced for varying durations have been shown to reduce state anxiety. This was never assessed in adolescents with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). AIMS: To compare the effect of a holistic yoga program with the conventional exercise program on anxiety level in adolescents with PCOS. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Ninety adolescent (15-18 years) girls from a residential college in Andhra Pradesh, who satisfied the Rotterdam criteria, were randomized into two groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anxiety levels were assessed at inclusion and after 12 weeks of intervention wherein yoga group practiced a holistic yoga module while the control group practiced a matching set of physical exercises (1 h/day, for 12 weeks). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare difference scores (delta change) between the two groups RESULTS: Changes in state anxiety after the intervention were nonsignificantly different between the two groups (P=0.243), while changes after the intervention were significantly different between the two groups (P=0.002) for trait anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Twelve weeks of a holistic yoga program in adolescents with PCOS is significantly better than physical exercise program in reducing anxiety symptoms.

22869993	Immediate effect of chandra nadi pranayama (left unilateral forced nostril breathing) on cardiovascular parameters in hypertensive patients.	INTRODUCTION: Recent studies have reported differential physiological and psychological effects produced by exclusive right and left nostril breathing and clinical research is required to prove immediate and sustained efficacy of these techniques in various psychosomatic conditions such as hypertension (HT). The present study was designed to determine immediate effects of 27 rounds of exclusive left nostril breathing, a yogic pranayama technique known as chandra nadi pranayama (CNP) on cardiovascular parameters in patients of essential HT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty two patients of essential HT under regular standard medical management were individually taught to perform CNP by a qualified yoga instructor with a regularity of 6 breaths/min throughout a performance of 27 rounds of CNP. Pre and post intervention heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) measurements were recorded using non-invasive semi-automatic BP monitor and Students t test for paired data used to determine significant differences. RESULTS: Twenty seven rounds of CNP produced an immediate decrease in all the measured cardiovascular parameters with the decrease in HR, systolic pressure (SP), pulse pressure, rate-pressure product and double product being statistically significant. Further, gender-based sub-analysis of our data revealed that our male participants evidenced significant reductions in HR and SP with an insignificant decrease in diastolic pressure, while in female participants only HR decreased significantly with an insignificant decrease in SP. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: It is concluded that CNP is effective in reducing HR and SP in hypertensive patients on regular standard medical management. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previously published reports on immediate effects of left UFNB in patients of HT and ours is the first to report on this beneficial clinical effect. This may be due to a normalization of autonomic cardiovascular rhythms with increased vagal modulation and/or decreased sympathetic activity along with improvement in baroreflex sensitivity. Further studies are required to enable a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved as well as determine how long such a BP lowering effect persists. We recommend that this simple and cost effective technique be added to the regular management protocol of HT and utilized when immediate reduction of BP is required in day-to-day as well as clinical situations.

22869992	Yoga breathing through a particular nostril is associated with contralateral event-related potential changes.	BACKGROUND: In earlier studies uninostril yoga breathing was shown to influence the activity of the cerebral hemispheres differently, based on (i) auditory evoked potentials recorded from bilateral scalp sites, and (ii) performance in hemisphere-specific tasks. But change in P300 (event-related potential generated when subjects attend to and discriminate between stimuli) from bilateral scalp sites when subjects were practicing uni- and alternate-nostril breathing are yet to be explored. AIM: The present study was designed to determine whether or not immediately after uninostril or alternate nostril yoga breathing there would be a change in the ability to pay attention to a given stimulus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine healthy male volunteers, with ages between 20 and 45 years were randomly allocated to five sessions, viz., (i) right-, (ii) left-, (iii) alternate-nostril yoga breathing, (iv) breath awareness and (v) no intervention, each for 45 min on separate days. The P300 event related potential was recorded using an auditory oddball paradigm from sites on the left (C3) and right (C4), referenced to linked earlobes, before and after each session. RESULTS: Post-hoc analysis with Bonferroni adjustment showed that the P300 peak latency was significantly lower at C3 compared to that at C4, following right nostril yoga breathing (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that right nostril yoga breathing facilitates the activity of contralateral (left) hemisphere, in the performance of the P300 task.

22869991	Yoga in Australia: Results of a national survey.	INTRODUCTION: The therapeutic benefits of yoga and meditation are well documented, yet little is known about the practice of yoga in Australia or elsewhere, whether as a physical activity, a form of therapy, a spiritual path or a lifestyle. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To investigate the practice of yoga in Australia, a national survey of yoga practitioners was conducted utilizing a comprehensive web-based questionnaire. Respondents were self-selecting to participate. A total of 3,892 respondents completed the survey. Sixty overseas respondents and 1265 yoga teachers (to be reported separately) were excluded, leaving 2,567 yoga practitioner respondents. RESULTS: The typical yoga survey respondent was a 41-year-old, tertiary educated, employed, health-conscious female (85% women). Asana (postures) and vinyasa (sequences of postures) represented 61% of the time spent practicing, with the other 39% devoted to the gentler practices of relaxation, pranayama (breathing techniques), meditation and instruction. Respondents commonly started practicing yoga for health and fitness but often continued practicing for stress management. One in five respondents practiced yoga for a specific health or medical reason which was seen to be improved by yoga practice. Of these, more people used yoga for stress management and anxiety than back, neck or shoulder problems, suggesting that mental health may be the primary health-related motivation for practicing yoga. Healthy lifestyle choices were seen to be more prevalent in respondents with more years of practice. Yoga-related injuries occurring under supervision in the previous 12 months were low at 2.4% of respondents. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga practice was seen to assist in the management of specific health issues and medical conditions. Regular yoga practice may also exert a healthy lifestyle effect including vegetarianism, non-smoking, reduced alcohol consumption, increased exercise and reduced stress with resulting cost benefits to the community.

22869990	Yoga therapy for Schizophrenia.	Schizophrenia is one of the most severe mental disorders. Despite significant advances in pharmacotherapy, treatment remains sub-optimal, with many patients having persisting deficits, especially in cognitive and social functioning. Yoga as a therapy has proven to be effective as a sole or additional intervention in psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety. Recently, there has been significant interest in the application of yoga therapy in psychosis and schizophrenia. To review a) the evidence for the use of yoga therapy in patients with schizophrenia b) studies which have been done in this area, c) the barriers for reaching yoga to patients, and d) future directions, an English language literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and EBSCO as well as grey literature was done. Research reports have demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of yoga as an add-on therapy in schizophrenia, particularly in improving negative symptomatology and social cognition. However, the biological underpinnings of this effect remain unclear, although there are some indications that hormones like oxytocin may contribute to the changes in social cognition.

22869314	Region-specific deflection responses of WorldSID and ES2-re devices in pure lateral and oblique side impacts.	The objective of this study was to determine region-specific deflection responses of the WorldSID and ES2 -re devices under pure lateral and oblique side impact loading. A modular, anthropometry-specific load wall was used. It consisted of the Shoulder, Thorax, Abdomen, superior Pelvis, and inferior Pelvis plates, termed the STAPP load wall design. The two devices were positioned upright on the platform of a bench seat, and sled tests were conducted at 3.4, 6.7, and 7.5 m/s. Two chestbands were used on each dummy at the thoracic and abdominal regions. Internal sensors were also used. Effective peak deflections were obtained from the chestband contours. Based on the preselected lateral-most point/location on the pretest contour, "internal sensor-type" peak deflections were also obtained using chestband contours. In addition, peak deflection data were obtained from internal sensor records. In oblique tests, the mean "IR-TRACC-type" peak deflections in the WorldSID device were 40 to 80% of effective peak deflections, whereas the mean "potentiometer-type" peak deflections in the ES2-device were 7 to 50%. The WorldSID device appears to better mimic region -specific responses to oblique loading than the ES2-re device, likely due to the differences in its des ign of the thoracic and abdominal regions. While the lateral -most point corresponding to the current 1D IR-TRACC location was found to replicate the pure lateral response, it was found to be less than optimal to track oblique loading. Although a laterally positioned sensor provides lower peak deflections in oblique loading, the addition of an angle-measuring sensor should allow modulating the translational metric for this mode. From this perspective, it may be worthwhile to use a 2D IR-TRACC or an optical sensor to verify these findings without chestband measures. Such an analysis has the potential to modify thoracic and abdominal injury criteria to account for obliqueness.	Yoganandan, Narayan;Humm, John R;Pintar, Frank A;Brasel, Karen	2011 Nov
22867933	Tai Chi and yoga as complementary therapies in rheumatologic conditions.	Tai Chi and yoga are complementary therapies which have, during the last few decades, emerged as popular treatments for rheumatologic and musculoskeletal diseases. This review covers the evidence of Tai Chi and yoga in the management of rheumatologic diseases, especially osteoarthritis of the knee, hip and hand, and rheumatoid arthritis. There is evidence that Tai Chi and yoga are safe, and some evidence that they have benefit, leading to reduction of pain and improvement of physical function and quality of life in patients. Recommendations for Tai Chi in knee osteoarthritis have recently been issued by the American College of Rheumatology. To allow broader recommendations for the use of Tai Chi and yoga in rheumatic diseases, there is a need to collect more evidence researched with larger randomised controlled trials.

22866996	Yoga Nidra relaxation increases heart rate variability and is unaffected by a prior bout of Hatha yoga.	OBJECTIVE: The measurement of heart rate variability (HRV) is often applied as an index of autonomic nervous system (ANS) balance and, therefore, myocardial stability. Previous studies have suggested that relaxation or mind-body exercise can influence ANS balance positively as measured by HRV but may act via different mechanisms. No studies, to the authors' knowledge, have examined the acute response in HRV to interventions combining relaxation and mind-body exercise. The objective of this study was to compare the acute HRV responses to Yoga Nidra relaxation alone versus Yoga Nidra relaxation preceded by Hatha yoga. DESIGN: This was a randomized counter-balanced trial. SETTING: The trial was conducted in a university exercise physiology laboratory. SUBJECTS: Subjects included 20 women and men (29.15+/-6.98 years of age, with a range of 18-47 years). INTERVENTIONS: Participants completed a yoga plus relaxation (YR) session and a relaxation only (R) session. RESULTS: The YR condition produced significant changes from baseline in heart rate (HR; beats per minute [bpm], p<0.001) and indices of HRV: R-R (ms, p<0.001), pNN50 (%, p=0.009), low frequency (LF; %, p=0.008) and high frequency (HF; %, p=0.035). The R condition produced significant changes from baseline in heart rate (bpm, p<0.001) as well as indices of HRV: R-R (ms, p<0.001), HF (ms(2), p=0.004), LF (%, p=0.005), HF (%, p=0.008) and LF:HF ratio (%, p=0.008). There were no significant differences between conditions at baseline nor for the changes from baseline for any of the variables. CONCLUSIONS: These changes demonstrate a favorable shift in autonomic balance to the parasympathetic branch of the ANS for both conditions, and that Yoga Nidra relaxation produces favorable changes in measures of HRV whether alone or preceded by a bout of Hatha yoga.

22864296	Yoga for youth in pain: the UCLA pediatric pain program model.	Children, adolescents, and young adults do not typically feature in clinics, studies, and mainstream notions of chronic pain. Yet many young people experience debilitating pain for extended periods of time. Chronic pain in these formative years may be especially important to treat in order for young patients to maintain life tasks and to prevent protracted disability. The Pediatric Pain Program at the University of California, Los Angeles, is a multidisciplinary treatment program designed for young people with chronic pain and their families. We offer both conventional and complementary medicine to treat the whole individual. This article describes the work undertaken in the clinic and our newly developed Yoga for Youth Research Program. The clinical and research programs fill a critical need to provide service to youth with chronic pain and to scientifically study one of the more popular complementary treatments we offer, Iyengar yoga.

22856637	Salivary cortisol monitoring: determination of reference values in healthy children and application in asthmatic children.	Venipuncture testing of adrenocortical function in asthmatic infants and young children receiving inhaled corticosteroids can raise cortisol levels and mask physiological responses. This study aimed to establish reference ranges for salivary cortisol levels and evaluate the safety and effects of jet-nebulized budesonide inhalation suspension (BIS) on salivary cortisol levels and patient outcomes in infants and young children with mild or persistent asthma. Reference salivary cortisol levels were determined in healthy children aged 6 months to 4 years old. A 12-week multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, open-label study was performed involving 53 age-matched asthmatic children who received either 0.5 mg/day of BIS or 40-60 mg/day of cromolyn sodium inhalation suspension (CIS) via compressor nebulizer. The effective measuring range of salivary cortisol concentration in asthmatic children was 0.12-3.00 micrograms/dL. The upper and lower limits of the reference range were 0.827 and 0.076 micrograms/dL, respectively. No significant difference was seen from baseline through week 12 in the CIS and BIS groups. BIS was safe in these patients, with no inhibitory effects on adrenocortical function. Salivary cortisol measurement offers a useful and accurate tool for testing adrenocortical function in infants and young children. Longer-term studies that incorporate testing of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis are warranted to confirm our findings.

22855674	Neurocognitive correlates of the effects of yoga meditation practice on emotion and cognition: a pilot study.	Mindfulness meditation involves attending to emotions without cognitive fixation of emotional experience. Over time, this practice is held to promote alterations in trait affectivity and attentional control with resultant effects on well-being and cognition. However, relatively little is known regarding the neural substrates of meditation effects on emotion and cognition. The present study investigated the neurocognitive correlates of emotion interference on cognition in Yoga practitioners and a matched control group (CG) underwent fMRI while performing an event-related affective Stroop task. The task includes image viewing trials and Stroop trials bracketed by neutral or negative emotional distractors. During image viewing trials, Yoga practitioners exhibited less reactivity in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) to negative as compared to neutral images; whereas the CG had the opposite pattern. A main effect of valence (negative > neutral) was observed in limbic regions (e.g., amygdala), of which the magnitude was inversely related to dlPFC activation. Exploratory analyses revealed that the magnitude of amygdala activation predicted decreased self-reported positive affect in the CG, but not among Yoga practitioners. During Stroop trials, Yoga practitioners had greater activation in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) during Stroop trials when negative, compared to neutral, emotional distractor were presented; the CG exhibited the opposite pattern. Taken together, these data suggest that though Yoga practitioners exhibit limbic reactivity to negative emotional stimuli, such reactivity does not have downstream effects on later mood state. This uncoupling of viewing negative emotional images and affect among Yoga practitioners may be occasioned by their selective implementation of frontal executive-dependent strategies to reduce emotional interference during competing cognitive demands and not during emotional processing per se.

22854549	[Effects of a yoga-focused prenatal program on stress, anxiety, self confidence and labor pain in pregnant women with in vitro fertilization treatment].	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify the effects of a Yoga-focused prenatal program on the stress, anxiety, self confidence and labor pain of pregnant women who had in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. METHODS: A quasi experimental study with a non-equivalent control group pretest-posttest design was used. The data collection period and meditation program were between January 9 and August 31, 2009. Forty-six women who were pregnant following IVF, and were between 12-20 weeks gestation, participated in the study (23 experimental group, 23 control group). Data were analyzed using Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U Test, ANCOVA, and Cronbach's alpha coefficients with the SPSS 12.0 for Windows Program. RESULTS: Although the sample size was limited, women who participated in the program showed statistically significant improvements in stress, anxiety, labor pain, and labor confidence for women pregnant after IVF. CONCLUSION: The result indicate that this 12-week Yoga-focused educational program can be utilized for women pregnant following IVF to reduce their stress, anxiety, and labor pain, and to increase delivery confidence. It is suggested that the Yoga-focused educational program be offered to every pregnant woman.	Shim, Chung Sin;Lee, Young-Sook	2012 Jun
22852023	Development of Specific Aspects of Spirituality during a 6-Month Intensive Yoga Practice.	The majority of research on yoga focuses on its psychophysiological and therapeutic benefits, while the spiritual aspects are rarely addressed. Changes of specific aspects of spirituality were thus investigated among 160 individuals (91% women, mean age 40.9 +/- 8.3 years; 57% Christians) starting a 2-year yoga teacher training. We used standardized questionnaires to measure aspects of spirituality (ASP), mindfulness (FMI-Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory), life satisfaction (BMLSS-Brief Multidimensional Life Satisfaction Scale), and positive mood (lightheartedness/relief). At the start of the course, scores of the respective ASP subscales for search for insight/wisdom, transcendence conviction, and conscious interactions/compassion were high, while those for religious orientation were low. Within the 6 month observation period, both conscious interactions/compassion (effect size, Cohen's d = .33), Religious orientation (d = .21), Lightheartedness/Relief (d = .75) and mindfulness (d = .53) increased significantly. Particularly non-religious/non-spiritual individuals showed moderate effects for an increase of conscious interactions/compassion. The results from this study suggest that an intensive yoga practice (1) may significantly increase specific aspects of practitioners' spirituality, mindfulness, and mood, (2) that these changes are dependent in part on their original spiritual/religious self-perception, and (3) that there are strong correlations amongst these constructs (i.e., conscious interactions/compassion, and mindfulness).

22846109	Is it me or not me? Modulation of perceptual-motor awareness and visuomotor performance by mindfulness meditation.	BACKGROUND: Attribution of agency involves the ability to distinguish our own actions and their sensory consequences which are self-generated from those generated by external agents. There are several pathological cases in which motor awareness is dramatically impaired. On the other hand, awareness-enhancement practices like tai-chi and yoga are shown to improve perceptual-motor awareness. Meditation is known to have positive impacts on perception, attention and consciousness itself, but it is still unclear how meditation changes sensorimotor integration processes and awareness of action. The aim of this study was to investigate how visuomotor performance and self-agency is modulated by mindfulness meditation. This was done by studying meditators' performance during a conflicting reaching task, where the congruency between actions and their consequences is gradually altered. This task was presented to novices in meditation before and after an intensive 8 weeks mindfulness meditation training (MBSR). The data of this sample was compared to a group of long-term meditators and a group of healthy non-meditators. RESULTS: Mindfulness resulted in a significant improvement in motor control during perceptual-motor conflict in both groups. Novices in mindfulness demonstrated a strongly increased sensitivity to detect external perturbation after the MBSR intervention. Both mindfulness groups demonstrated a speed/accuracy trade-off in comparison to their respective controls. This resulted in slower and more accurate movements. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that mindfulness meditation practice is associated with slower body movements which in turn may lead to an increase in monitoring of body states and optimized re-adjustment of movement trajectory, and consequently to better motor performance. This extended conscious monitoring of perceptual and motor cues may explain how, while dealing with perceptual-motor conflict, improvement in motor control goes beyond the mere increase of movement time. The reduction of detection threshold in the MBSR group is also likely due to the enhanced monitoring of these processes. Our findings confirmed our assumptions about the positive effect of mindfulness on perceptual-motor integration processes.	Naranjo, Jose Raul;Schmidt, Stefan	2012 Jul 30
22844341	Cancer-related stress and complementary and alternative medicine: a review.	A cancer diagnosis elicits strong psychophysiological reactions that characterize stress. Stress is experienced by all patients but is usually not discussed during patient-healthcare professional interaction; thus underdiagnosed, very few are referred to support services. The prevalence of CAM use in patients with history of cancer is growing. The purpose of the paper is to review the aspects of cancer-related stress and interventions of commonly used complementary and alternative techniques/products for amelioration of cancer-related stress. Feasibility of intervention of several CAM techniques and products commonly used by cancer patients and survivors has been established in some cancer populations. Efficacy of some CAM techniques and products in reducing stress has been documented as well as stress-related symptoms in patients with cancer such as mindfulness-based stress reduction, yoga, Tai Chi Chuan, acupuncture, energy-based techniques, and physical activity. Much of the research limitations include small study samples and variety of intervention length and content. Efficacy and safety of many CAM techniques and some herbs and vitamin B and D supplements need to be confirmed in further studies using scientific methodology. Several complementary and alternative medicine therapies could be integrated into standard cancer care to ameliorate cancer-related stress.

22836351	Poststroke balance improves with yoga: a pilot study.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Balance impairment is common after stroke; modified yoga may be able to improve balance and other important poststroke variables. Scientific-evidence is needed to support such treatment interventions. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of a yoga-based rehabilitation intervention on balance, balance self-efficacy, fear of falling (FoF), and quality of life after stroke. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized, pilot study of yoga-based rehabilitation for people with chronic stroke. All yoga sessions were taught by a registered yoga therapist, occurred twice per week for 8 weeks and included seated, standing, and floor postures with relaxation and meditation. Balance was assessed with the Berg Balance Scale, balance self-efficacy with the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, FoF with a dichotomous yes/no question, and quality of life with the Stroke Specific Quality of Life scale. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between wait-list control (n=10) and yoga (n=37) groups in baseline or follow-up scores. However, using within-group comparisons, yoga group data demonstrated significant improvement in balance (Berg Balance Scale, 41.3+/-11.7 vs 46.3+/-9.1; P<0.001) and FoF (51% vs 46% with FoF; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A group yoga-based rehabilitation intervention for people with chronic stroke has potential in improving multiple poststroke variables. Group yoga may be complementary to rehabilitation, may be possible in medical-based and community-based settings, and may be cost-effective. Further testing of group yoga-based rehabilitation interventions is warranted. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: http://clinicaltrials.gov. Unique Identifier: NCT01109602.

22830969	Efficacy of a short-term yoga-based lifestyle intervention in reducing stress and inflammation: preliminary results.	OBJECTIVES: Previously it was shown that a brief yoga-based lifestyle intervention was efficacious in reducing oxidative stress and risk of chronic diseases even in a short duration. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of this intervention in reducing stress and inflammation in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases. DESIGN: This study reports preliminary results from a nonrandomized prospective ongoing study with pre-post design. SETTING/LOCATION: The study was conducted at the Integral Health Clinic, an outpatient facility conducting these yoga-based lifestyle intervention programs for prevention and management of chronic diseases. SUBJECTS: Patients with chronic inflammatory diseases and overweight/obese subjects were included while physically challenged, and those on other interventions were excluded from the study. INTERVENTION: A pretested intervention program included asanas (postures), pranayama (breathing exercises), stress management, group discussions, lectures, and individualized advice. OUTCOME MEASURES: There was a reduction in stress (plasma cortisol and beta-endorphin) and inflammation (interleukin [IL]-6 and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) at day 0 versus day 10. RESULTS: Eighty-six (86) patients (44 female, 42 male, 40.07 +/- 13.91 years) attended this program. Overall, the mean level of cortisol decreased from baseline to day 10 (149.95 +/- 46.07, 129.07 +/- 33.30 ng/mL; p=0.001) while beta-endorphins increased from baseline to day 10 (3.53 +/- 0.88, 4.06 +/- 0.79 ng/mL; p=0.024). Also, there was reduction from baseline to day 10 in mean levels of IL-6 (2.16 +/- 0.42, 1.94 +/- 0.10 pg/mL, p=0.036) and TNF-alpha (2.85 +/- 0.59, 1.95 +/- 0.32 pg/mL, p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: This brief yoga-based lifestyle intervention reduced the markers of stress and inflammation as early as 10 days in patients with chronic diseases; however, complete results of this study will confirm whether this program has utility as complementary and alternative therapy.

22824453	Complementary and alternative medicine use among youth with juvenile arthritis: are youth using CAM, but not talking about it?	PURPOSE: To examine self-reported use and correlates of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in adolescents with juvenile arthritis (JA). METHODS: One hundred thirty-four adolescents with JA completed an online survey of their use of, interest in, and discussions about CAM. The PedsQL 4.0 SF15 assessed quality of life. RESULTS: The majority (72%) of youth reported using >/=1 CAM modality. Use did not differ by sex, age, race, or geographic location. The most commonly used CAM modalities were yoga (45%) and meditation, relaxation, or guided imagery (40%). Low psychosocial quality of life was associated with massage and meditation, relaxation, or guided imagery use (p < .05). Only 46% of youth reported discussing CAM with a health care provider. Nonusers were most interested in learning more about massage (79%) and yoga (57%). CONCLUSIONS: Youth with JA reported high use of CAM, but few discussed CAM with health care providers. Findings suggest practitioners should engage adolescents in discussions about CAM.	Seburg, Elisabeth M;Horvath, Keith J;Garwick, Ann W;McMorris, Barbara J;Vehe, Richard K;Scal, Peter	2012 Aug

22820158	The acute effects of yoga on executive function.	BACKGROUND: Despite an increase in the prevalence of yoga exercise, research focusing on the relationship between yoga exercise and cognition is limited. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of an acute yoga exercise session, relative to aerobic exercise, on cognitive performance. METHODS: A repeated measures design was employed where 30 female college-aged participants (Mean age = 20.07, SD = 1.95) completed 3 counterbalanced testing sessions: a yoga exercise session, an aerobic exercise session, and a baseline assessment. The flanker and n-back tasks were used to measure cognitive performance. RESULTS: Results showed that cognitive performance after the yoga exercise bout was significantly superior (ie, shorter reaction times, increased accuracy) as compared with the aerobic and baseline conditions for both inhibition and working memory tasks. The aerobic and baseline performance was not significantly different, contradicting some of the previous findings in the acute aerobic exercise and cognition literature. CONCLUSION: These findings are discussed relative to the need to explore the effects of other nontraditional modes of exercise such as yoga on cognition and the importance of time elapsed between the cessation of the exercise bout and the initiation of cognitive assessments in improving task performance.

22818031	Women's experiences of participation in a pregnancy and postnatal group incorporating yoga and facilitated group discussion: a qualitative evaluation.	BACKGROUND: This paper reports on a small qualitative research study which explored women's experiences of participation in a pregnancy and postnatal group that incorporated yoga and facilitated discussion. The group is offered through a community based feminist non-government women's health Centre in Northern NSW Australia. QUESTION: The purpose of the research was to explore women's experiences of attending this pregnancy and postnatal group. METHODS: An exploratory qualitative approach was used to explore women's experiences of attending the group. Fifteen women participated in individual, in-depth face-to-face interviews. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was undertaken to analyse the qualitative data. FINDINGS: Six themes were developed, one with 3 subthemes. One theme was labelled as: 'the pregnancy and motherhood journey' and included 3 sub-themes which were labelled: 'preparation for birth', 'connecting with the baby' and 'sharing birth stories.' The other five themes were: 'feminine nurturing safe space', 'watching and learning the mothering', 'building mental health, well-being and connections', the "group like a rock and a seed' and 'different from mainstream'. CONCLUSION: This research adds to the overall body of knowledge about the value of yoga in pre and postnatal care. It demonstrates the value of sharing birth stories and the strong capacity women have to support one another, bringing benefits of emotional and social well-being, information, resources and support derived from group based models of care.

22813667	Yoga: a spiritual practice with therapeutic value in psychiatry.	UNLABELLED: Yoga is one of the spiritual practices derived from the orthodox school of Hindu philosophy. The practices were codified by Patanjali under the title of Ashtanga Yoga. Although Yoga was traditionally seen as a practice meant for achieving self-realization, in recent years there has been significant attention given to the effects of yoga practices on physical and mental health. Yoga as a therapy has proven to be effective as a sole or additional intervention in several psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSIONS: The literature suggests that yoga can lead to significant symptomatic improvements in psychiatric disorders, along with neurobiological effects which may underlie these changes. This suggests that mental health professionals should be open to the potential benefits of spiritual practices for their patients, either as complementary interventions to modern treatments or as sole treatment in some disorders.

22812905	The benefits of yoga for women veterans with chronic low back pain.	OBJECTIVES: Chronic low back (CLBP) pain is prevalent among military veterans and often leads to functional limitations, psychologic symptoms, lower quality of life, and higher health care costs. An increasing proportion of U.S. veterans are women, and women veterans may have different health care needs than men veterans. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of a yoga intervention on women and men with CLBP. SUBJECTS/SETTING/INTERVENTION: VA patients with CLBP were referred by primary care providers to a clinical yoga program. DESIGN: Research participants completed a brief battery of questionnaires before their first yoga class and again 10 weeks later in a single-group, pre-post study design. OUTCOME MEASURES: Questionnaires included measures of pain (Pain Severity Scale), depression (CESD-10), energy/fatigue, and health-related quality of life (SF-12). Yoga attendance and home practice of yoga were also measured. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to analyze group differences over time while controlling for baseline differences. RESULTS: The 53 participants who completed both assessments had a mean age of 53 years, and were well educated, 41% nonwhite, 49% married, and had varying employment status. Women participants had significantly larger decreases in depression (p=0.046) and pain "on average" (p=0.050), and larger increases in energy (p=0.034) and SF-12 Mental Health (p=0.044) than men who participated. The groups did not differ significantly on yoga attendance or home practice of yoga. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that women veterans may benefit more than men veterans from yoga interventions for chronic back pain. Conclusions are tentative because of the small sample size and quasi-experimental study design. A more rigorous study is being designed to answer these research questions more definitively.

22812583	Body mass index contributes to sympathovagal imbalance in prehypertensives.	BACKGROUND: The present study was conducted to assess the nature of sympathovagal imbalance (SVI) in prehypertensives by short-term analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) to understand the alteration in autonomic modulation and the contribution of BMI to SVI in the genesis of prehypertension. METHODS: Body mass index (BMI), basal heart rate (BHR), blood pressure (BP), rate pressure product (RPP) and HRV indices such as total power (TP), low-frequency power (LF), normalized LF (LFnu), high-frequency power (HF), normalized HF (HFnu), LF-HF ratio, mean heart rate (mean RR), square root of the mean squared differences of successive normal to normal intervals (RMSSD), standard deviation of normal to normal RR interval (SDNN), the number of interval differences of successive NN intervals greater than 50 ms (NN50) and the proportion derived by dividing NN50 by the total number of NN intervals (pNN50) were assessed in three groups of subjects: normotensives having normal BMI (Group 1), prehypertensives having normal BMI (Group 2) and prehypertensives having higher BMI (Group 3). SVI was assessed from LF-HF ratio and correlated with BMI, BHR, BP and RPP in all the groups by Pearson correlation. The contribution of BMI to SVI was assessed by multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: LF and LFnu were significantly increased and HF and HFnu were significantly decreased in prehypertensive subjects in comparison to normotensive subjects and the magnitude of these changes was more prominent in subjects with higher BMI compared to that of normal BMI. LF-HF ratio, the sensitive indicator of sympathovagal balance had significant correlation with BMI (P=0.000) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (P=0.002) in prehypertensives. BMI was found to be an independent contributing factor to SVI (P=0.001) in prehypertensives. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that autonomic imbalance in prehypertensives manifested in the form of increased sympathetic activity and vagal inhibition. In prehypertensives with higher BMI, vagal withdrawal was predominant than sympathetic overactivity. Magnitude of SVI (alteration in LF-HF ratio) was linked to changes in BMI and DBP. BMI had an independent influence on LF-HF ratio. It was advised that life-style modifications such as yoga and exercise would enable achieve the sympathovagal balance and blood pressure homeostasis in prehypertensives.

22808940	Effects of a holistic yoga program on endocrine parameters in adolescents with polycystic ovarian syndrome: a randomized controlled trial.	OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this trial were to compare the effects of a holistic yoga program with the conventional exercise program in adolescent polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). DESIGN: This was a prospective, randomized, active controlled trial. SETTING: Ninety (90) adolescent (15-18 years) girls from a residential college in Andhra Pradesh who satisfied the Rotterdam criteria were randomized into two groups. INTERVENTION: The yoga group practiced a holistic yoga module, while the control group practiced a matching set of physical exercises (1 hour/day, for 12 weeks). OUTCOME MEASURES: Anti-mullerian hormone (AMH-primary outcome), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone, prolactin, body-mass index (BMI), hirsutism, and menstrual frequency were measured at inclusion and after 12 weeks. RESULTS: Mann-Whitney test on difference score shows that changes in AMH (Y=-2.51, C=-0.49, p=0.006), LH, and LH/FSH ratio (LH: Y=-4.09, C=3.00, p=0.005; LH/FSH: Y=-1.17, C=0.49, p=0.015) were significantly different between the two intervention groups. Also, changes in testosterone (Y=-6.01, C=2.61, p=0.014) and Modified Ferriman and Gallway (mFG) score (Y=-1.14, C=+0.06, p=0.002) were significantly different between the two groups. On the other hand, changes in FSH and prolactin postintervention were nonsignificantly different between the two groups. Also, body weight and BMI showed nonsignificantly different changes between the two groups, while changes in menstrual frequency were significantly different between the two groups (Y=0.89, C=0.49, p=0.049). CONCLUSIONS: A holistic yoga program for 12 weeks is significantly better than physical exercise in reducing AMH, LH, and testosterone, mFG score for hirsutism, and improving menstrual frequency with nonsignificant changes in body weight, FSH, and prolactin in adolescent PCOS.

22808932	Effect of a home-based simple yoga program in child-care workers: a randomized controlled trial.	OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the effect of a brief, simple, home-based yoga program on body pain and health status in child-care workers. DESIGN: This was a randomized, controlled trial comparing a home-based yoga group and a control group. PARTICIPANTS: The trial comprised 98 healthy female nursery school and kindergarten teachers. INTERVENTIONS: A DVD of a simple home-based yoga program was provided for a period of 2 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the reported change in body pain at 2 weeks (after intervention) and 4 weeks (follow-up). The secondary outcome measure was the 30-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ30) score and physical function. RESULTS: The 67 yoga group participants reported improved menstrual pain at 4 weeks; menstrual pain was reduced from 57.0 +/- 27.8 to 37.8 +/- 26.7 in the yoga group, versus 52.4 +/- 36.5 to 46.9 +/- 32.1 in the control group (change from baseline in the yoga group versus change from baseline in the control group, -15.3 points; p=0.044). The total GHQ30 score and the GHQ subscale scores ("sleep disturbance" and "anxiety and dysphoria") improved significantly at 4 weeks in the yoga group, but not in the control group. In the good-adherence group, low back pain improved during the intervention (p=0.006) and follow-up (p=0.001) periods. Menstrual pain was also improved (p=0.044). No adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A home-based simple yoga program may improve the health status of child-care workers.

22803933	Mindfulness- and acceptance-based interventions for anxiety disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	PURPOSE: Mindfulness- and acceptance-based interventions (MABIs) are receiving increasing attention in the treatment of mental disorders. These interventions might be beneficial for patients with anxiety disorders, but no prior reviews have comprehensively investigated the effects of this family of interventions on clinical samples. The aim of this study was to review and synthesize extant research on MABIs for patients with diagnoses of anxiety disorders. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of relevant databases according to pre-defined criteria. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they employed MABIs for patients diagnosed with anxiety disorders. RESULTS: Nineteen eligible studies were found. Meta-analysis of within-group pre- to post-treatment effects yielded overall Hedges'g effect sizes of 1.08 for anxiety symptoms and 0.85 for depression symptoms. For controlled studies, overall between-group Hedges'g was 0.83 for anxiety symptoms and 0.72 for depression symptoms. Moderator analyses examined whether intervention type, design, treatment dosage, or patient sample was associated with systematic variation in effect sizes. No significant moderating effects were found on the variables examined, apart from an observed superiority in effect size for clinical trials on samples of patients with mixed anxiety disorders. However, differential effect sizes indicated benefits of adding specific psychotherapeutic content to mindfulness training, as well as an advantage of individual over group treatment. CONCLUSIONS: MABIs are associated with robust and substantial reductions in symptoms of anxiety and comorbid depressive symptoms. More research is needed to determine the efficacy of MABIs relative to current treatments of choice, and to clarify the contribution of processes of mindfulness and acceptance to observed outcome.

22802698	Yoga training improves metabolic parameters in obese boys.	Yoga has been known to have stimulatory or inhibitory effects on the metabolic parameters and to be uncomplicated therapy for obesity. The purpose of the present study was to test the effect of an 8-week of yoga-asana training on body composition, lipid profile, and insulin resistance (IR) in obese adolescent boys. Twenty volunteers with body mass index (BMI) greater than the 95th percentile were randomly assigned to yoga (age 14.7+/-0.5 years, n=10) and control groups (age 14.6+/-1.0 years, n=10). The yoga group performed exercises three times per week at 40~60% of heart-rate reserve (HRR) for 8 weeks. IR was determined with the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). After yoga training, body weight, BMI, fat mass (FM), and body fat % (BF %) were significantly decreased, and fat-free mass and basal metabolic rate were significantly increased than baseline values. FM and BF % were significantly improved in the yoga group compared with the control group (p<0.05). Total cholesterol (TC) was significantly decreased in the yoga group (p<0.01). HDL-cholesterol was decreased in both groups (p<0.05). No significant changes were observed between or within groups for triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol, glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR. Our findings show that an 8-week of yoga training improves body composition and TC levels in obese adolescent boys, suggesting that yoga training may be effective in controlling some metabolic syndrome factors in obese adolescent boys.

22802544	Use of and attitudes toward complementary and alternative medicine among osteopathic medical students.	CONTEXT: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has grown into a huge health care industry in the United States, with 91.5 million people (38% of adults) using CAM in 2007. Given the increase in CAM use and the need for CAM education for health professionals, it is important to understand the baseline attitudes and beliefs of osteopathic medical students regarding CAM, as well as the factors that may have formed them. OBJECTIVES: (1) To determine osteopathic medical students' use of different CAM modalities. (2) To assess osteopathic medical students' attitudes toward CAM using a previously validated instrument. METHODS: A previously validated, 29-item Integrative Medicine Attitude Questionnaire and a 10-item CAM Health Belief Questionnaire were administered to osteopathic medical students. Demographic and other data were collected on student use of and recommendations for CAM modalities as well as student awareness and use of primary CAM information resources. RESULTS: Survey respondents were 635 osteopathic medical students from 7 osteopathic medical schools and additional locations in the United States. Osteopathic medical students demonstrated positive attitudes toward CAM use. A total of 527 osteopathic medical students (83.0%) self-reported the use of at least 1 CAM modality, whereas 69 students (10.9%) used just 1 CAM modality and 458 (72.1%) used 2 or more modalities. The most commonly used CAM modalities--meditation/yoga/relaxation/imagery, massage, and spirituality/prayer--were also most likely to be suggested to patients by osteopathic medical students. Sex, age, and the use of CAM modalities were significantly correlated with attitudes toward CAM modalities. CONCLUSION: Osteopathic medical students had a positive attitude toward CAM and had high levels of self-reported CAM knowledge and use. Osteopathic medical students who acquire professional training and have personal experience with CAM may be in a better position to discuss CAM with future patients.

22795617	Yogic meditation reverses NF-kappaB and IRF-related transcriptome dynamics in leukocytes of family dementia caregivers in a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Although yoga and meditation have been used for stress reduction with reported improvement in inflammation, little is known about the biological mechanisms mediating such effects. The present study examined if a yogic meditation might alter the activity of inflammatory and antiviral transcription control pathways that shape immune cell gene expression. METHODS: Forty-five family dementia caregivers were randomized to either Kirtan Kriya Meditation (KKM) or Relaxing Music (RM) listening for 12 min daily for 8 weeks and 39 caregivers completed the study. Genome-wide transcriptional profiles were collected from peripheral blood leukocytes sampled at baseline and 8-week follow-up. Promoter-based bioinformatics analyses tested the hypothesis that observed transcriptional alterations were structured by reduced activity of the pro-inflammatory nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB family of transcription factors and increased activity of Interferon Response Factors (IRFs; i.e., reversal of patterns previously linked to stress). RESULTS: In response to KKM treatment, 68 genes were found to be differentially expressed (19 up-regulated, 49 down-regulated) after adjusting for potentially confounded differences in sex, illness burden, and BMI. Up-regulated genes included immunoglobulin-related transcripts. Down-regulated transcripts included pro-inflammatory cytokines and activation-related immediate-early genes. Transcript origin analyses identified plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B lymphocytes as the primary cellular context of these transcriptional alterations (both p<.001). Promoter-based bioinformatic analysis implicated reduced NF-kappaB signaling and increased activity of IRF1 in structuring those effects (both p<.05). CONCLUSION: A brief daily yogic meditation intervention may reverse the pattern of increased NF-kappaB-related transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased IRF1-related transcription of innate antiviral response genes previously observed in healthy individuals confronting a significant life stressor.

22784346	Effect of Sahaja yoga meditation on quality of life, anxiety, and blood pressure control.	OBJECTIVE: The present study investigates the effect of Sahaja yoga meditation on quality of life, anxiety, and blood pressure control. DESIGN: The prospective observational cohort study enrolled two study groups: those receiving treatment from the International Sahaja Yoga Research and Health Center (meditation group) and those receiving treatment from the Mahatma Gandhi Mission Hospital (control group). Researchers measured quality of life, anxiety, and blood pressure before and after treatment. RESULTS: Sixty-seven (67) participants in the meditation group and 62 participants in the control group completed the study. The two groups were comparable in demographic and clinical characteristics. At baseline, the meditation group had higher quality of life (p<0.001) than controls but similar anxiety level (p=0.74) to controls. Within-group pre- versus post-treatment comparisons showed significant improvement in quality of life, anxiety, and blood pressure in the meditation group (p<0.001), while in controls, quality of life deteriorated and there was no improvement in blood pressure. The improvement in quality of life, anxiety reduction, and blood pressure control was greater in the meditation group. The beneficial effect of meditation remained significant after adjusting for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Meditation treatment was associated with significant improvements in quality of life, anxiety reduction, and blood pressure control.

22778930	Managing Mental Health Disorders Resulting from Trauma through Yoga: A Review.	There are many and varied types of trauma. The extent to which trauma influences the mental health of an individual depends on the nature of trauma, as well as on the individual's coping capabilities. Often trauma is followed by depression, anxiety, and PTSD. As the pharmacological remedies for these conditions often have undesirable side-effects, nonpharmacological remedies are thought of as a possible add-on treatment. Yoga is one such mind-body intervention. This paper covers eleven studies indexed in PubMed, in which mental health disorders resulting from trauma were managed through yoga including meditation. The aim was to evaluate the use of yoga in managing trauma-related depression, anxiety, PTSD and physiological stress following exposure to natural calamities, war, interpersonal violence, and incarceration in a correctional facility. An attempt has also been made to explore possible mechanisms underlying benefits seen. As most of these studies were not done on persons exposed to trauma that had practiced yoga, this is a definite area for further research.	Telles, Shirley;Singh, Nilkamal;Balkrishna, Acharya	2012
22775424	Yoga training improves quality of life in women with asthma.	OBJECTIVES: Individuals with asthma frequently suffer with a decrease in quality of life. Yoga has been shown to improve autonomic function in the healthy population and has been used as an alternative therapy to help improve symptoms associated with various diseases. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess whether 10 weeks of yoga training can improve quality of life and heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with asthma. DESIGN: Nineteen (19) females were randomly assigned to a yoga group or a control group for a 10-week intervention while still following guidelines established by their physician. All subjects answered the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) to assess quality of life and performed an isometric handgrip exercise test to assess HRV. RESULTS: Based on the SGRQ, significant improvements (45%, p < 0.05) in quality of life were observed with the yoga training, while no changes were found in the control group. Resting hemodynamic measures improved significantly in the yoga group compared to the control group (p < 0.05). The yoga group decreased parasympathetic modulation (HFnu [normalized units]) pre- to postintervention (0.45 +/- 0.60 to 0.35 +/- 0.06 nu, p<0.05, respectively) in response to the isometric forearm exercise (IFE), whereas the control group did not change. Additionally, the yoga group increased sympathetic (LFnu) (pre 0.47 +/- 0.07 to post 0.60 +/- 0.07 nu, p < 0.05) and sympathovagal modulation (logLF/HF) (pre 4.61 +/- 0.39 to post 5.31 +/- 0.44, p < 0.05, respectively) during IFE with no change in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga training improved quality of life in women with mild-to-moderate asthma and resulted in decreased parasympathetic and increased sympathetic modulation in response to an IFE.

22772663	Yoga as an ancillary treatment for neurological and psychiatric disorders: a review.	Yoga is gaining acceptance as an ancillary medical treatment, but there have been few studies evaluating its therapeutic benefits in neurological and major psychiatric conditions. The authors reviewed the literature in English on the efficacy of yoga for these disorders. Only randomized, controlled trials were included, with the exception of the only study of yoga for bipolar disorder, which was observational. Trials were excluded if yoga was not the central component of the intervention. Of seven randomized, controlled trials of yoga in patients with neurological disorders, six found significant, positive effects. Of 13 randomized, controlled trials of yoga in patients with psychiatric disorders, 10 found significant, positive effects. These results, although encouraging, indicate that additional randomized, controlled studies are needed to critically define the benefits of yoga for both neurological and psychiatric disorders.

22760464	[Complementary and alternative therapies for fibromyalgia syndrome. Systematic review, meta-analysis and guideline].	BACKGROUND: The scheduled update to the German S3 guidelines on fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) by the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies ("Arbeitsgemeinschaft der Wissenschaftlichen Medizinischen Fachgesellschaften", AWMF; registration number 041/004) was planned starting in March 2011. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The development of the guidelines was coordinated by the German Interdisciplinary Association for Pain Therapy ("Deutsche Interdisziplinaren Vereinigung fur Schmerztherapie", DIVS), 9 scientific medical societies and 2 patient self-help organizations. Eight working groups with a total of 50 members were evenly balanced in terms of gender, medical field, potential conflicts of interest and hierarchical position in the medical and scientific fields. Literature searches were performed using the Medline, PsycInfo, Scopus and Cochrane Library databases (until December 2010). The grading of the strength of the evidence followed the scheme of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. The recommendations were based on level of evidence, efficacy (meta-analysis of the outcomes pain, sleep, fatigue and health-related quality of life), acceptability (total dropout rate), risks (adverse events) and applicability of treatment modalities in the German health care system. The formulation and grading of recommendations was accomplished using a multi-step, formal consensus process. The guidelines were reviewed by the boards of the participating scientific medical societies. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Meditative movement therapies (qi gong, tai chi, yoga) are strongly recommended. Acupuncture can be considered. Mindfulness-based stress reduction as monotherapy and dance therapy as monotherapy are not recommended. Homeopathy is not recommended. In a minority vote, homeopathy was rated as "can be considered". Nutritional supplements and reiki are not recommended.

22751025	Follow-up of yoga of awareness for fibromyalgia: results at 3 months and replication in the wait-list group.	OBJECTIVES: Published preliminary findings from a randomized-controlled trial suggest that an 8-week Yoga of Awareness intervention may be effective for improving symptoms, functional deficits, and coping abilities in fibromyalgia. The primary aims of this study were to evaluate the same intervention's posttreatment effects in a wait-list group and to test the intervention's effects at 3-month follow-up in the immediate treatment group. METHODS: Unpaired t tests were used to compare data from a per protocol sample of 21 women in the immediate treatment group who had completed treatment and 18 women in the wait-list group who had completed treatment. Within-group paired t tests were performed to compare posttreatment data with 3-month follow-up data in the immediate treatment group. The primary outcome measure was the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire Revised (FIQR). Multilevel random-effects models were also used to examine associations between yoga practice rates and outcomes. RESULTS: Posttreatment results in the wait-list group largely mirrored results seen at posttreatment in the immediate treatment group, with the FIQR Total Score improving by 31.9% across the 2 groups. Follow-up results showed that patients sustained most of their posttreatment gains, with the FIQR Total Score remaining 21.9% improved at 3 months. Yoga practice rates were good, and more practice was associated with more benefit for a variety of outcomes. DISCUSSION: These findings indicate that the benefits of Yoga of Awareness in fibromyalgia are replicable and can be maintained.

24250042	Efficacy of yoga therapy on subjective well-being and basic living skills of patients having chronic schizophrenia.	BACKGROUND: Scientific studies demonstrate efficacy of yogic treatment methods in stress and anxiety related disorders, psychosomatic disorders and physical illness. Very few studies have been conducted on schizophrenic patients. AIMS: This study was conducted to determine the efficacy of yoga therapy on subjective well-being, basic living skills, self-care, interpersonal, communicational and routine functions of schizophrenic patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty chronic schizophrenic hospitalized patients were selected from Ranchi Institute of Neuro-Psychiatry and Allied Sciences, Ranchi and were randomly assigned to the experimental group (yoga therapy along with Pharmacotherapy, n=15), and to control group (Pharmacotherapy alone, n=15). Baseline assessment was done using Post Graduate Institute general well-being measure (GWBM), Checklist for basic living skills and Indian disability evaluation and assessment scale (IDEAS). The experimental group attended yoga therapy every day for about 1(1/2) h including motivational and feedback session. After 1 month post-assessment was done for both the groups. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Pearson Chi-square test was used for comparing the results. RESULTS: At the end of 1 month experimental group showed better rating in comparison to control group in PGI GWBM, basic living skills and IDEAS. CONCLUSION: Yoga could improve patients' subjective well-being, their daily basic living functioning, personal hygiene, self-care, interpersonal activities and communication, and prompted more involvement in routine work.

24250040	Psychological benefits of yoga in industrial workers.	BACKGROUND: The industrial workers are exposed to stress and strain due to the tough nature of their duties. There is a need to incorporate simple, cost effective, and easily implementable measures in the industries to tackle this menace of stress. Yoga has been considered a suitable candidate for this job. Hence this study was undertaken to evaluate the psychological benefits of yoga in workers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four hundred healthy young general duty workers were enrolled for this study and made into four matched groups of 100 each. One group was given regular Yoga practice in the morning, another group was given regular physical training in the morning, third group was exposed to regular physical training in the morning and Yoga in the evening, and the last group was exposed to neither of them. All were assessed for their psychological state at base line, 4 weeks and at 12 weeks using specified scales. The findings were statistically analysed. RESULTS: Yoga was found to have more beneficial psychological effect comparable to physical training. However maximum benefit was obtained when Yoga was combined with PT. CONCLUSION: Yoga has got positive psychological benefits in general duty workers when practiced regularly. The benefits are enhanced when Yoga is combined with PT.

22740100	Effectiveness of a worksite lifestyle intervention on vitality, work engagement, productivity, and sick leave: results of a randomized controlled trial.	OBJECTIVES: A worksite lifestyle intervention aiming to improve lifestyle behaviors could be an effective tool to keep older workers vital, and thereby prolong their labor participation. Therefore, this study evaluates the effectiveness of such an intervention on vitality, work engagement, productivity and sick leave. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial design, 367 workers (control group: N=363) received a 6-month intervention, which included two weekly guided group sessions: one yoga and one workout, as well as one weekly session of aerobic exercising, without face-to-face instruction, and three individual coach visits aimed at changing workers' lifestyle behavior by goal setting, feedback, and problem-solving strategies. Furthermore, free fruit was provided at the guided sessions. Data on work-related vitality (UWES vitality scale), general vitality (RAND-36 vitality scale), work engagement (UWES), productivity (single item scoring 0-10), and sick leave (yes/no past 3 months) were collected using questionnaires at baseline (N=730), and at 6- (N=575) and 12-months (N=500) follow-up. Effects were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle with complete cases (N=500) and imputed data (N=730). RESULTS: There were no significant differences in vitality, work engagement, productivity, and sick leave between the intervention and control group workers after either 6- and 12-months follow-up. Yoga and workout subgroup analyses showed a 12-month favorable effect on work-related vitality [beta=0.14, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.04-0.28] and general vitality (beta=2.9, 95% CI 0.02-5.9) among high yoga compliers. For high workout compliers, this positive trend was also seen, but it was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of worksite yoga facilities could be a useful strategy to promote vitality-related work outcomes, but only if high compliance can be maximized. Therefore, impeding factors for participation should be investigated in more detail in future research.	Strijk, Jorien E;Proper, Karin I;van Mechelen, Willem;van der Beek, Allard J	2013 Jan
22740082	Examining a therapeutic yoga program for prostate cancer survivors.	BACKGROUND: In the earlier stages of prostate cancer, effective treatments have created a need for research to focus on practices that may improve quality of life throughout survivorship. Physical activity is a significant supportive care management strategy for prostate cancer survivors, though the optimal modality is not yet understood. HYPOTHESES: The authors hypothesized that yoga would be a feasible physical activity option for prostate cancer survivors and their support persons and that the incorporation of social support would increase physical activity adherence. METHODS: This 14-week feasibility study involved a 7-week class-based yoga program (adherence phase), followed by 7 weeks of self-selected physical activity (maintenance phase). Demographic information, physical activity behavior, quality of life, fatigue, stress, mood, and fitness variables were assessed at 3 time points. Prostate cancer survivors' perceived social support was rated during yoga and after yoga. RESULTS: Class attendance was 6.1 and 5.8 for prostate cancer survivors (n = 15) and their support persons (n = 10), respectively, for the 7 classes. Levels of perceived social support were higher for those who brought a support person. Significant improvements with regard to stress, fatigue, and mood before and after yoga class (all Ps < .05) were reported by all participants. No clinically significant changes were noted on prostate cancer survivor's quality of life or fatigue over the course of the 14-week study. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga is a feasible physical activity option for prostate cancer survivors. The program had a promising uptake rate, high program adherence rate, and there were acute program benefits with regard to stress, fatigue, and mood for all participants. Future examination is warranted with regard to chronic benefits and group cohesion influences on levels of perceived social support.

22721366	[Non-medicinal treatments of spasticity in multiple sclerosis].	Non-medicinal treatments of spasticity may be proposed in patients with multiple sclerosis as either an adjunct to pharmacological treatments or the first line of treatment. Assessment of non-medicinal treatments, whether manual, surgical or with instrumentation, shows it to be beneficial for limb spasticity. Studies also reveal that, contrary to expectations, physical exercise does not increase spasticity. This means that physical exercise may be prioritized and that sports practice should not be forbidden, provided that the patient has an adequate neurological status and takes sufficient breaks to avoid fatigue.

22721740	Prenatal exercise research.	In this review of recent research on prenatal exercise, studies from several different countries suggest that only approximately 40% of pregnant women exercise, even though about 92% are encouraged by their physicians to exercise, albeit with some 69% of the women being advised to limit their exercise. A moderate exercise regime reputedly increases infant birthweight to within the normal range, but only if exercise is decreased in late pregnancy. Lower intensity exercise such as water aerobics has decreased low back pain more than land-based physical exercise. Heart rate and blood pressure have been lower following yoga than walking, and complications like pregnancy-induced hypertension with associated intrauterine growth retardation and prematurity have been less frequent following yoga. No studies could be found on tai chi with pregnant women even though balance and the risk of falling are great concerns during pregnancy, and tai chi is one of the most effective forms of exercise for balance. Potential underlying mechanisms for exercise effects are that stimulating pressure receptors during exercise increases vagal activity which, in turn, decreases cortisol, increases serotonin and decreases substance P, leading to decreased pain. Decreased cortisol is particularly important inasmuch as cortisol negatively affects immune function and is a significant predictor of prematurity. Larger, more controlled trials are needed before recommendations can be made about the type and amount of pregnancy exercise.	Field, Tiffany	2012 Jun
22715961	Yoga for osteoarthritis: nursing and research considerations.	Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of pain and disability worldwide. Current treatment guidelines recommend nonpharmacological approaches such as yoga for firstline treatment of OA. Yoga is a promising mind-body practice that includes physical postures, breathing practices, and meditative mental focus. This article presents the current evidence, as well as a proposed conceptual model for future research. Current research on yoga for OA is scant but promising, showing some evidence of reduced pain, sleep disturbance, and disability. The conceptual model described here proposes musculoskeletal effects (strengthening, flexibility, relaxation), reduction of autonomic arousal, and therapeutic cognitive patterns (distraction, mindfulness) as potentially important mechanisms of yoga. This article also describes considerations for patients and health care providers when evaluating the potential usefulness and safety of yoga programs: yoga style, instructor qualifications, and amount of time spent in yoga practice.

22715488	Mid-latency auditory evoked potentials in 2 meditative states.	Mid-latency auditory evoked potentials (MLAEPs) were assessed in 60 participants during 4 mental states described in traditional yoga texts. These 4 mental states are random thinking, nonmeditative-focused thinking, meditative focusing, and meditation. Assessments were made before (5 minutes), during (20 minutes), and after (5 minutes) each of the 4 states, on 4 separate days. There were prolonged latencies of 2 MLAEPs components, the Na and Pa waves during meditation (P < .05, post hoc analyses following analysis of variance [ANOVA]), suggesting that auditory information transmission at the level of the medial geniculate and primary auditory cortex (ie, the neural generators corresponding to the Na and Pa waves) was delayed. Hence, meditation influenced MLAEPs, while meditative focusing did not.

22710259	Investigating the perceived feasibility of integrative medicine in a conventional oncology setting: yoga therapy as a treatment for breast cancer survivors.	BACKGROUND: A majority of cancer survivors experience debilitating effect(s) related to their cancer diagnosis and treatments across physical, psychological, social, and spiritual domains. Timely and innovative solutions are needed to address the adverse treatment-related effects and often disjointed services that breast cancer patients face. Recent studies suggest that the majority of breast cancer survivors are using complementary and alternative medicine at some point along their cancer trajectory. In recent years, scientists and clinicians have examined the effects of yoga therapy among cancer patients and survivors. The current study examined the perceived feasibility of implementing yoga therapy as a treatment service for breast cancer patients at a large urban cancer center in Canada. METHODS: A mixed-methods approach that included focus groups and self-reported surveys with health care providers (HCPs) and breast cancer patients was used in this research. RESULTS: Overall, results indicated that breast cancer patients and HCPs were supportive and eager for the implementation of a yoga therapy program. Six themes emerged from the analysis of the focus group and the survey data: (1) the availability of resources and accessibility of yoga therapy, (2) the credibility and transparency of yoga therapy, (3) the understanding of yoga therapy, (4) an educational component, (5) the therapeutic context, and (6) the integration of yoga therapy. Specific facilitators and barriers became evident within these themes. CONCLUSIONS: Although enthusiasm for the implementation of an integrative yoga therapy program was apparent among both breast cancer survivors and HCPs, barriers were also identified. The findings of this study are currently being used to inform a large-scale program of research aimed at developing integrative treatment services for breast cancer patients, beginning with yoga therapy.

22707866	Measurement of the effect of Isha Yoga on cardiac autonomic nervous system using short-term heart rate variability.	BACKGROUND: Beneficial effects of Yoga have been postulated to be due to modulation of the autonomic nervous system. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of Isha Yoga practices on cardiovascular autonomic nervous system through short-term heart rate variability (HRV). DESIGN OF THE STUDY: Short-term HRV of long-term regular healthy 14 (12 males and 2 females) Isha Yoga practitioners was compared with that of age- and gender-matched 14 (12 males and 2 females) non-Yoga practitioners. METHODS AND MATERIALS: ECG Lead II and respiratory movements were recorded in both groups using Polyrite during supine rest for 5 min and controlled deep breathing for 1 minute. Frequency domain analysis [RR interval is the mean of distance between subsequent R wave peaks in ECG], low frequency (LF) power, high frequency (HF) power, LF normalized units (nu), HF nu, LF/HF ratio] and time domain analysis [Standard Deviation of normal to normal interval (SDNN), square of mean squared difference of successive normal to normal intervals (RMSSD), normal to normal intervals which are differing by 50 ms (NN50), and percentage of NN50 (pNN50)] of HRV variables were analyzed for supine rest. Time domain analysis was recorded for deep breathing. RESULTS: Results showed statistically significant differences between Isha Yoga practitioners and controls in both frequency and time domain analyses of HRV indices, with no difference in resting heart rate between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Practitioners of Isha Yoga showed well-balanced beneficial activity of vagal efferents, an overall increased HRV, and sympathovagal balance, compared to non-Yoga practitioners during supine rest and deep breathing.

22707860	Yoga cAMP in ayurvedgrams of chhattisgarh.	The clinical and empirical health benefits of yoga and pranayam have been reiterated through research. Yoga is being adopted as a system to alleviate the burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) across the globe. The Directorate of AYUSH, Government of Chhattisgarh (DoA, GoCG) conducts annual 5-day-yoga camp across 146 Ayurvedgrams in the State. The present article brings out the AYUSH initiatives the State is taking toward active ageing. A total of 71,096 people participated in the 5-day-yoga camp across the State. A mean participation of 5079 people over 5 days was reported across districts. Such statewide practices need to be promoted and appraised.	Madhu, Raghavendra;Jain, Nilesh	2012 Apr
22707859	Awareness about bibliographic databases among students of Ayurveda and qualified Ayurveda practitioners.	Students of Ayurveda and qualified Ayurveda practitioners were assessed for awareness about bibliographic databases. One hundred and four volunteers (age range 17-64 years; group mean+/-SD, 24.3 +/- 7.9 years; 62 females) participated in this cross-sectional study. There were 3 groups. Group I had 60 undergraduate students of a bachelor's level course in Ayurveda, Group II had 20 graduate students of a 1-year Panchakarma course, and Group III had 24 Ayurveda physicians who were working in a yoga and Ayurveda center. An 8-question questionnaire was used for assessment. Undergraduates were found to be the best informed, followed by those who were working, while those doing post-graduation were the least well informed. The sample was from one institution; however, the findings emphasize the importance of updating the knowledge of post-graduates or those in practice.	Singh, Nilkamal;Telles, Shirley	2012 Apr
22696387	Exercise and mobilisation interventions for carpal tunnel syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Non-surgical treatment, including exercises and mobilisation, has been offered to people experiencing mild to moderate symptoms arising from carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). However, the effectiveness and duration of benefit from exercises and mobilisation for this condition remain unknown. OBJECTIVES: To review the efficacy and safety of exercise and mobilisation interventions compared with no treatment, a placebo or another non-surgical intervention in people with CTS. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialised Register (10 January 2012), CENTRAL (2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2012), CINAHL Plus (January 1937 to January 2012), and AMED (January 1985 to January 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing exercise or mobilisation interventions with no treatment, placebo or another non-surgical intervention in people with CTS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed searches and selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the included studies. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for primary and secondary outcomes of the review. We collected data on adverse events from included studies. MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen studies randomising 741 participants with CTS were included in the review. Two compared a mobilisation regimen to a no treatment control, three compared one mobilisation intervention (for example carpal bone mobilisation) to another (for example soft tissue mobilisation), nine compared nerve mobilisation delivered as part of a multi-component intervention to another non-surgical intervention (for example splint or therapeutic ultrasound), and three compared a mobilisation intervention other than nerve mobilisation (for example yoga or chiropractic treatment) to another non-surgical intervention. The risk of bias of the included studies was low in some studies and unclear or high in other studies, with only three explicitly reporting that the allocation sequence was concealed, and four reporting blinding of participants. The studies were heterogeneous in terms of the interventions delivered, outcomes measured and timing of outcome assessment, therefore, we were unable to pool results across studies. Only four studies reported the primary outcome of interest, short-term overall improvement (any measure in which patients indicate the intensity of their complaints compared to baseline, for example, global rating of improvement, satisfaction with treatment, within three months post-treatment). However, of these, only three fully reported outcome data sufficient for inclusion in the review. One very low quality trial with 14 participants found that all participants receiving either neurodynamic mobilisation or carpal bone mobilisation and none in the no treatment group reported overall improvement (RR 15.00, 95% CI 1.02 to 220.92), though the precision of this effect estimate is very low. One low quality trial with 22 participants found that the chance of being 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with treatment was 24% higher for participants receiving instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilisation compared to standard soft tissue mobilisation (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.75), though participants were not blinded and it was unclear if the allocation sequence was concealed. Another very low-quality trial with 26 participants found that more CTS-affected wrists receiving nerve gliding exercises plus splint plus activity modification had no pathologic finding on median and ulnar nerve distal sensory latency assessment at the end of treatment than wrists receiving splint plus activity modification alone (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.30). However, a unit of analysis error occurred in this trial, as the correlation between wrists in participants with bilateral CTS was not accounted for. Only two studies measured adverse effects, so more data are required before any firm conclusions on the safety of exercise and mobilisation interventions can be made. In general, the results of secondary outcomes of the review (short- and long-term improvement in CTS symptoms, functional ability, health-related quality of life, neurophysiologic parameters, and the need for surgery) for most comparisons had 95% CIs which incorporated effects in either direction. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is limited and very low quality evidence of benefit for all of a diverse collection of exercise and mobilisation interventions for CTS. People with CTS who indicate a preference for exercise or mobilisation interventions should be informed of the limited evidence of effectiveness and safety of this intervention by their treatment provider. Until more high quality randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness and safety of various exercise and mobilisation interventions compared to other non-surgical interventions are undertaken, the decision to provide this type of non-surgical intervention to people with CTS should be based on the clinician's expertise in being able to deliver these treatments and patient's preferences.

22679467	Social intuition as a form of implicit learning: Sequences of body movements are learned less explicitly than letter sequences.	In the current paper, we first evaluate the suitability of traditional serial reaction time (SRT) and artificial grammar learning (AGL) experiments for measuring implicit learning of social signals. We then report the results of a novel sequence learning task which combines aspects of the SRT and AGL paradigms to meet our suggested criteria for how implicit learning experiments can be adapted to increase their relevance to situations of social intuition. The sequences followed standard finite-state grammars. Sequence learning and consciousness of acquired knowledge were compared between 2 groups of 24 participants viewing either sequences of individually presented letters or sequences of body-posture pictures, which were described as series of yoga movements. Participants in both conditions showed above-chance classification accuracy, indicating that sequence learning had occurred in both stimulus conditions. This shows that sequence learning can still be found when learning procedures reflect the characteristics of social intuition. Rule awareness was measured using trial-by-trial evaluation of decision strategy (Dienes & Scott, 2005; Scott & Dienes, 2008). For letters, sequence classification was best on trials where participants reported responding on the basis of explicit rules or memory, indicating some explicit learning in this condition. For body-posture, classification was not above chance on these types of trial, but instead showed a trend to be best on those trials where participants reported that their responses were based on intuition, familiarity, or random choice, suggesting that learning was more implicit. Results therefore indicate that the use of traditional stimuli in research on sequence learning might underestimate the extent to which learning is implicit in domains such as social learning, contributing to ongoing debate about levels of conscious awareness in implicit learning.

22663908	Yoga is found hazardous to the meniscus for Chinese women.	OBJECTIVE: Yoga is becoming more and more popular in the female society while the concomitant sports injury is seldom mentioned. Many clinicians have noted that yoga may result in knee problems, which though requires more researches to corroborate. This investigation was conducted to ascertain the relationship between yoga and meniscus injury as well as the extent of impairment according to variant yoga practice periods. METHODS: Totally 819 women aged 20-49 years who practiced yoga or other popular sports including badminton, jogging, climbing hills, etc for at least one hour per day were selected to participate in this research. These subjects were required to complete a questionnaire and receive relevant physical examination. Magnetic resonance (MR) scan of the knee was recommended for the suspicious subjects for ultimate diagnosis. The subject with abnormal meniscus MR signals was defined as a case and matched with two controls in terms of age and body mass index (BMI). Altogether there were 273 cases and 546 controls. The nested case-control model was adopted to assess the risk of meniscus injury between variant exposures in practicing yoga and several other popular sports. Moreover, the 181 yoga subjects were subdivided into three groups according to different exercise durations, followed by further analysis with the variables of age, BMI and Lysholm score. RESULTS: Yoga was found associated with a higher risk (P equal to 0.008, OR equal to 1.621) of meniscus injury compared with badminton, jogging and climbing hills. The three yoga subgroups showed statistical difference between each other in terms of Lysholm score (P equal to 0.027) and BMI (P equal to 0.003). The subjects with longer-term yoga practice had lighter weight but lower Lysholm scores. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga perhaps exerts destructive impact on the meniscus for Chinese women, yet it needs further verifications. Furthermore, the female yoga players with longer exercise duration are more susceptible to meniscus injury though they can become leaner.	Zhu, Jun-Kun;Wu, Li-Dong;Zheng, Rong-Zong;Lan, Shu-Hua	2012
22661842	A comparative study on Vamana Karma with Madanaphala and Krutavedhana in Ekakushtha (Psoriasis).	Vamana Karma (therapeutic emesis) is the best therapy for the elimination of vitiated Kapha Dosha. In the present clinical practice Madanaphala (Randia dumetorum) is mainly used for Vamana Karma. Apart from Madanaphala, five other drugs, and in total 355 formulations are described in Charaka Samhita; one of them is Krutavedhana (Luffa acutangula) kalpa (formulations). Krutavedhana is specially indicated in Gadha (compact) Dosha condition like Kushtha (skin diseases), Garavisha (slow poison), and so on, for Vamana Karma. The present study aimed to observe the effect on Vamana Karma and by that its effect on Ekakushtha (Psoriasis). Krutavedhana Beeja Churna (seed powder) was given with Madhu (honey) and Saindhava (rock salt) as Vamana Yoga (emetic formulation), to compare it with Madanaphala Pippali Churna (seed powder). After the Sansarjana Krama (special dietetic schedule), Panchatikta Ghrita (medicated ghee) was given as Shamana Sneha (pacifying oleation). An average dose of Krutavedhana was 5.9 g. Krutavedhana could produce a good number of Vega (bouts), Pittanta Lakshana (bile coming out at the end of Vamana), and Pravara Shuddhi (maximum cleansing) in a majority of patients. Madanaphala is the best among all Vamaka (emetic) drugs, but Krutavedhana showed a similar to higher effect on Vamana Karma in terms of Antiki, Maniki, Vaigiki, and LaingikiShuddhi (cleansing criteria). Vamana Karma by Krutavedhana showed better relief in Matsyashakalopamam (silvery scale), Kandu (itching), and Rukshataa (dryness), while Madanapahala showed better relief in Krishnaruna Varna (erythema). After completion of the Shamana (pacifying) treatment, both the groups showed nearly the same effect on Asvedanam (lack of perspiration), Matsyashakalopamam, Kandu, Rukshataa, Krishnaruna Varna, and Mahaavaastu (bigger lesion).

22661835	Nisshesha rechaka pranayama offers benefits through brief intermittent hypoxia.	Hypoxia has been a frightening term for doctors and medical students because of the possibility of damage to cells, tissues and organs. However, we now know that brief, episodic hypoxia gives rise to several adaptive responses. These responses in general prepare the body for better tolerating such hypoxic episodes, and also offer protection against several other types of insults. Indeed, scientists at the erstwhile U.S.S.R. have developed what is known as 'hypoxia therapy' and reaped the benefits of brief intermittent hypoxia for the last several decades. In India, yogic treatment of various diseases is common. A lesser known but important variety of Pranayama is 'nisshesha rechaka', which may be described as breath holding at residual volume. Studies done at our centre have demonstrated that Nisshesha rechaka is the easiest way to produce brief, intermittent hypoxia. There is therefore reason to believe that Nisshesha rechaka pranayama may offer benefits through this mechanism.	Malshe, Prakash Chintamani	2011 Oct
22661830	Adjunctive cognitive remediation for schizophrenia using yoga: an open, non-randomized trial.	BACKGROUND: Yoga therapy (YT) improves cognitive function in healthy individuals, but its impact on cognitive function among persons with schizophrenia (SZ) has not been investigated. AIMS: Evaluate adjunctive YT for cognitive domains impaired in SZ. METHODS: Patients with SZ received YT or treatment as usual (TAU; n = 65, n = 23, respectively). Accuracy and speed for seven cognitive domains were assessed using a computerized neurocognitive battery (CNB), thus minimizing observer bias. Separately, YT was evaluated among patients with Bipolar I disorder (n = 40), Major Depressive Disorder (n = 37), and cardiology outpatients (n = 68). All patients also received routine pharmacotherapy. Patients were not randomized to YT or TAU. RESULTS: Compared with the SZ/TAU group, the SZ/YT group showed significantly greater improvement with regard to measures of attention following corrections for multiple comparisons; the changes were more prominent among the men. In the other diagnostic groups, differing patterns of improvements were noted with small to medium effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: Our initial analyses suggest nominally significant improvement in cognitive function in schizophrenia with adjunctive therapies such as YT. The magnitude of the change varies by cognitive domain and may also vary by diagnostic group.

22654688	Acupuncture and a gluten-free diet relieve urticaria and eczema in a case of undiagnosed dermatitis herpetiformis and atypical or extraintestinal celiac disease: a case report.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this case report is to describe the use of acupuncture and a gluten-free diet (GFD) for urticaria and severe eczema in a patient with undiagnosed dermatitis herpetiformis and atypical or extraintestinal celiac disease. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 48-year-old woman presented with intense urticaria, eczema, worsening heartburn, chronic constipation, headaches, and an intense feeling of heat for 4 months. Results of punch biopsies of the skin lesions and laboratory tests were inconclusive. After the acupuncture sessions reported here ended, human leukocyte antigen blood typing revealed celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis-associated human leukocyte antigen DQ-8. Results of an endoscopy and colonoscopy were negative. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: The patient received 3 acupuncture treatments a week for 12 weeks. The patient's symptoms began in March 2008. She began using topical and oral steroids and felt that her symptoms were not responding. Acupuncture began in July 2008. At the end of the first 12 treatments, during which she was using topical and oral steroids, the urticaria and constipation resolved completely; and she had temporary relief from the heartburn. It is thought that the urticaria and constipation resolved because of the acupuncture as that was the only change. At the end of the second 12 treatments, during which time she had started Optifast, a GFD, the heartburn, headache, and eczema resolved. At the end of the third 12 treatments, all her symptoms remained resolved. Steroid treatment was discontinued after the first 12 treatments. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture and diet changes appeared to provide relief from the urticaria and eczema of dermatitis herpetiformis beyond that obtained by traditional treatment of a GFD alone.

22649882	Complementary and alternative treatment of musculoskeletal pain.	The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is high and increasing worldwide. Patients usually use CAM in addition to conventional medicine, mainly to treat pain. In a large number of cases, people use CAM for chronic musculoskeletal pain as in osteoarthritis, back pain, neck pain, or fibromyalgia. Herewith, a review is presented of CAM efficacy in treating musculoskeletal pain for which, however, no scientific research has so far provided evidence solid enough. In some rare cases where adequate pain control cannot be achieved, CAM might be considered in rational and individual approach based on the first general rule in medicine "not to harm" and on the utility theory of each intervention, i.e. according to the presumed mechanism of painful stimulus and with close monitoring of the patient's response. Further high quality studies are warranted to elucidate the efficacy and side effects of CAM methods. Therefore, conventional medicine remains the main mode of treatment for patients with musculoskeletal painful conditions.	Grazio, Simeon;Balen, Diana	2011 Dec
24678442	Yoga Improves Upper-Extremity Function and Scapular Posturing in Persons with Hyperkyphosis.	OBJECTIVE: Hyperkyphosis (excess thoracic spine curvature) is associated with upper-extremity functional limitations and altered scapular posturing. The purpose of this study was to quantify the changes in upper-extremity function and scapular posturing following a 6-month yogaintervention in persons with hyperkyphosis. METHODS: Twenty-one older adults with hyperkyphosis (75.5+7.4 yrs) enrolled in the UCLA Yoga for Kyphosis randomized controlled trial, elected to participate in this uncontrolled, prepost substudy of upper-extremity function. They were measured at baseline and after a 24-week yoga intervention. Maximum vertical reach and timed book tests were used to evaluate upper-extremity function. Scapular posturing was quantified using a motion analysis system and data was obtained under 4 conditions: 1) quiet-standing, 2) normal walking, 3) fast walking, and 4) seated. Paired t-tests were used to test for changes between baseline and 6-month follow-up measures and Cohen's d was calculated to examine effect sizes. RESULTS: Following the 6-month yoga intervention, participants improved their book test performance by 26.4% (p < 0.001; d = 1.5). Scapular protraction decreased by 2.9% during the static-sitting condition (p < 0.001; d = 0.5) and the overall excursion of the scapulae decreased for both fast (25.0%, p < 0.05; d = 0.6) and self-selected walking (29.4%, p < 0.01; d = 0.9). There were no changes in maximum vertical reach. CONCLUSION: Subjects demonstrated significant improvements with small to large effect sizes in the timed book test and scapular posturing to a less protracted position during both static and dynamic conditions after the intervention. These adaptations are likely to reduce the risk of scapular impingement and help preserve functional independence in older adults.

22641322	Physical activity in patients with advanced-stage cancer: a systematic review of the literature.	The importance of physical activity for chronic disease prevention and management has become generally well accepted. The number of research interventions and publications examining the benefits of physical activity for patients with cancer has been rising steadily. However, much of that research has focused on the impact of physical activity either prior to or early in the cancer diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship process. Research focusing on the effects of physical activity, specifically for patients with advanced-stage cancer and poorer prognostic outcomes, has been addressed only recently. The purpose of this article is to examine the state of the science for physical activity in the advanced-stage disease subset of the cancer population. Exercise in a variety of intensities and forms, including yoga, walking, biking, and swimming, has many health benefits for people, including those diagnosed with cancer. Research has shown that, for people with cancer (including advanced-stage cancer), exercise can decrease anxiety, stress, and depression while improving levels of pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, constipation, and insomnia. People diagnosed with cancer should discuss with their oncologist safe, easy ways they can incorporate exercise into their daily lives.	Albrecht, Tara A;Taylor, Ann Gill	2012 Jun 1
22639944	The effect of yoga on women with secondary arm lymphoedema from breast cancer treatment.	BACKGROUND: Women who develop secondary arm lymphoedema subsequent to treatment associated with breast cancer require life-long management for a range of symptoms including arm swelling, heaviness, tightness in the arm and sometimes the chest, upper body impairment and changes to a range of parameters relating to quality of life. While exercise under controlled conditions has had positive outcomes, the impact of yoga has not been investigated. The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of yoga in the physical and psycho-social domains, in the hope that women can be offered another safe, holistic modality to help control many, if not all, of the effects of secondary arm lymphoedema. METHODS AND DESIGN: A randomised controlled pilot trial will be conducted in Hobart and Launceston with a total of 40 women receiving either yoga intervention or current best practice care. Intervention will consist of eight weeks of a weekly teacher-led yoga class with a home-based daily yoga practice delivered by DVD. Primary outcome measures will be the effects of yoga on lymphoedema and its associated symptoms and quality of life. Secondary outcome measures will be range of motion of the arm and thoracic spine, shoulder strength, and weekly and daily physical activity. Primary and secondary outcomes will be measured at baseline, weeks four, eight and a four week follow up at week twelve. Range of motion of the spine, in a self-nominated group, will be measured at baseline, weeks eight and twelve. A further outcome will be the women's perceptions of the yoga collected by interview at week eight. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will provide information on the safety and effectiveness of yoga for women with secondary arm lymphoedema from breast cancer treatment. It will also inform methodology for future, larger trials. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ACTRN12611000202965.

22629512	Comprehensive yogic breathing program improves quality of life in patients with diabetes.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a comprehensive yogic breathing program on glycemic control and quality of life (QOL) in patients with diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a prospective randomized controlled intervention trial. Patients having HbA1c between 6 and 9% for at least 3 months with lifestyle modification and oral antidiabetic medication were included. They were followed-up and randomized at 6 months into two groups: one group receiving standard treatment of diabetes and the other group receiving standard treatment of diabetes and taught and told to regularly practice the comprehensive yogic breathing program (Sudarshan Kriya Yoga and Pranayam). Change in fasting and post-prandial blood sugars, glycated hemoglobin and QOL as assessed by the World Health Organization QOL WHOQOL BREF questionnaire were assessed. RESULTS: There was a trend toward improvement in glycemic control in the group practicing the comprehensive yogic breathing program compared with the group following standard treatment alone, although this was not significant. There was significant improvement in physical, psychological and social domains and total QOL post-intervention in the group practicing the comprehensive yogic breathing program as compared with the group following standard treatment alone. CONCLUSION: There was significant improvement in the QOL and a non-significant trend toward improvement in glycemic control in the group practicing the comprehensive yogic breathing program compared with the group that was following standard treatment alone.

22621705	"Effect of pranayama and meditation as an add-on therapy in rehabilitation of patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome--a randomized control pilot study".	OBJECTIVE: To study the add-on effects of pranayama and meditation in rehabilitation of patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). PATIENTS AND METHOD: This randomized control pilot study was conducted in neurological rehabilitation unit of university tertiary research hospital. Twenty-two GBS patients, who consented for the study and satisfied selection criteria, were randomly assigned to yoga and control groups. Ten patients in each group completed the study. The yoga group received 15 sessions in total over a period of 3 weeks (1 h/session), one session per day on 5 days per week that consisted of relaxation, Pranayama (breathing practices) and Guided meditation in addition to conventional rehabilitation therapeutics. The control group received usual rehabilitation care. All the patients were assessed using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Numeric pain rating scale, Hospital anxiety and Depression scale and Barthel index score. Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon's signed rank test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Quality of sleep improved significantly with reduction of PSQI score in the yoga group (p = 0.04). There was reduction of pain scores, anxiety and depression in both the groups without statistical significance between groups (pain p > 0.05, anxiety p > 0.05 and depression p > 0.05). Overall functional status improved in both groups without significant difference (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Significant improvement was observed in quality of sleep with yogic relaxation, pranayama, and meditation in GBS patients.

22618308	Mindfulness-based stress reduction for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: a randomized wait-list controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional disorder of the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract affected by stress, which may benefit from a biopsychosocial treatment approach such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR). PURPOSE: A treatment as usual (TAU) wait-list controlled trial was conducted in Calgary, Canada to investigate the impact of MBSR on IBS symptoms. It was hypothesized that MBSR patients would experience greater reduction in overall IBS symptom severity and self-reported symptoms of stress relative to control patients. METHOD: Ninety patients diagnosed with IBS using the Rome III criteria were randomized to either an immediate MBSR program (n = 43) or to wait for the next available program (n = 47). Patients completed IBS symptom severity, stress, mood, quality of life (QOL), and spirituality scales pre- and post-intervention or waiting period and at 6-month follow-up. Intent-to-treat linear mixed model analyses for repeated measures were conducted, followed by completers analyses. RESULTS: While both groups exhibited a decrease in IBS symptom severity scores over time, the improvement in the MBSR group was greater than the controls and was clinically meaningful, with symptom severity decreasing from constantly to occasionally present. Pre- to post-intervention dropout rates of 44 and 23 % for the MBSR and control groups, respectively, were observed. At 6-month follow-up, the MBSR group maintained a clinically meaningful improvement in overall IBS symptoms compared to the wait-list group, who also improved marginally, resulting in no statistically significant differences between groups at follow-up. Improvements in overall mood, QOL, and spirituality were observed for both groups over time. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this trial provide preliminary evidence for the feasibility and efficacy of a mindfulness intervention for the reduction of IBS symptom severity and symptoms of stress and the maintenance of these improvements at 6 months post-intervention. Attention and self-monitoring and/or anticipation of MBSR participation may account for smaller improvements observed in TAU patients.

22611427	Quality of life and functional health status of long-term meditators.	Background. There is very little data describing the long-term health impacts of meditation. Aim. To compare the quality of life and functional health of long-term meditators to that of the normative population in Australia. Method. Using the SF-36 questionnaire and a Meditation Lifestyle Survey, we sampled 343 long-term Australian Sahaja Yoga meditation practitioners and compared their scores to those of the normative Australian population. Results. Six SF-36 subscales (bodily pain, general health, mental health, role limitation-emotional, social functioning, and vitality) were significantly better in meditators compared to the national norms whereas two of the subscales (role limitation-physical, physical functioning) were not significantly different. A substantial correlation between frequency of mental silence experience and the vitality, general health, and especially mental health subscales (P < 0.005) was found. Conclusion. Long-term practitioners of Sahaja yoga meditation experience better functional health, especially mental health, compared to the general population. A relationship between functional health, especially mental health, and the frequency of meditative experience (mental silence) exists that may be causal. Evidence for the potential role of this definition of meditation in enhancing quality of life, functional health and wellbeing is growing. Implications for primary mental health prevention are discussed.	Manocha, Ramesh;Black, Deborah;Wilson, Leigh	2012
22592178	Bikram yoga training and physical fitness in healthy young adults.	There has been relatively little longitudinal controlled investigation of the effects of yoga on general physical fitness, despite the widespread participation in this form of exercise. The purpose of this exploratory study was to examine the effect of short-term Bikram yoga training on general physical fitness. Young healthy adults were randomized to yoga training (N = 10, 29 +/- 6 years, 24 sessions in 8 weeks) or a control group (N = 11, 26 +/- 7 years). Each yoga training session consisted of 90-minute standardized supervised postures performed in a heated and humidified studio. Isometric deadlift strength, handgrip strength, lower back/hamstring and shoulder flexibility, resting heart rate and blood pressure, maximal oxygen consumption (treadmill), and lean and fat mass (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) were measured before and after training. Yoga subjects exhibited increased deadlift strength, substantially increased lower back/hamstring flexibility, increased shoulder flexibility, and modestly decreased body fat compared with control group. There were no changes in handgrip strength, cardiovascular measures, or maximal aerobic fitness. In summary, this short-term yoga training protocol produced beneficial changes in musculoskeletal fitness that were specific to the training stimulus.	Tracy, Brian L;Hart, Cady E F	2013 Mar
22585034	The acute effects of exercise on cigarette cravings, withdrawal symptoms, affect, and smoking behaviour: systematic review update and meta-analysis.	RATIONALE: Smoking cessation is associated with cigarette cravings and tobacco withdrawal symptoms (TWS), and exercise appears to ameliorate many of these negative effects. A number of studies have examined the relationships between exercise, cigarette cravings, and TWS. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were (a) to review and update the literature examining the effects of short bouts of exercise on cigarette cravings, TWS, affect, and smoking behaviour and (b) to conduct meta-analyses of the effect of exercise on cigarette cravings. METHODS: A systematic review of all studies published between January 2006 and June 2011 was conducted. RESULTS: Fifteen new studies were identified, 12 of which found a positive effect of exercise on cigarette cravings. The magnitude of statistically significant effect sizes for 'desire to smoke' and 'strength of desire to smoke' ranged from 0.4 to 1.98 in favour of exercise compared to passive control conditions, and peaked either during or soon after treatment. Effects were found up to 30 min post-exercise. Cigarette cravings were reduced following exercise with a wide range of intensities from isometric exercise and yoga to activity as high as 80-85 % heart rate reserve. Meta-analyses revealed weighted mean differences of -1.90 and -2.41 in 'desire to smoke' and 'strength of desire to smoke' outcomes, respectively. Measures of TWS and negative affect were reduced following light-moderate intensity exercise, but increased during vigorous exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise can have a positive effect on cigarette cravings and TWS. However, the most effective exercise intensity to reduce cravings and the underlying mechanisms associated with this effect remain unclear.

22577578	Decreased nocturnal awakenings in young adults performing bikram yoga: a low-constraint home sleep monitoring study.	This pilot study evaluated the impact of Bikram Yoga on subjective and objective sleep parameters. We compared subjective (diary) and objective (headband sleep monitor) sleep measures on yoga versus nonyoga days during a 14-day period. Subjects (n = 13) were not constrained regarding yoga-practice days, other exercise, caffeine, alcohol, or naps. These activities did not segregate by choice of yoga days. Standard sleep metrics were unaffected by yoga, including sleep latency, total sleep time, and percentage of time spent in rapid eye movement (REM), light non-REM, deep non-REM, or wake after sleep onset (WASO). Consistent with prior work, transition probability analysis was a more sensitive index of sleep architecture changes than standard metrics. Specifically, Bikram Yoga was associated with significantly faster return to sleep after nocturnal awakenings. We conclude that objective home sleep monitoring is feasible in a low-constraint, real-world study design. Further studies on patients with insomnia will determine whether the results generalize or not.	Kudesia, Ravi S;Bianchi, Matt T	2012
22562939	An overview of integrative care options for patients with chronic wounds.	Integrative care incorporates aspects of traditional and nontraditional medicine, also often referred to as holistic or complementary and alternative medicine. Providing integrative wound care involves addressing physical, psychosocial, and spiritual components of the whole person. Several care models, including the Seven Balance Point Model, include holistic considerations, as well as promotion of physical health recommendations involving nutrition, sleep, exercise, and emotional, social, and spiritual well-being. The quality of life of patients with chronic wounds may be negatively affected by chronic and procedural pain, sleep disturbance, social, and emotional concerns. Although research into the role of integrative medicine in wound care is limited, experiences from other disciplines suggest wound pain may be addressed using acupuncture, yoga, biofeedback, guided imagery, massage, healing touch and therapeutic touch, aromatherapy, and topical medical-grade honey. In addition, patients who are incontinent or have incontinence-related skin damage or peristomal complications may benefit from biofeedback to better control incontinence. Research to increase understanding about the role of holistic care for patients with wound, stoma, and continence-related problems in general, and its effect on the quality of life of palliative care patients in particular, will help clinicians provide evidence-based and patient-centered care.

22549981	Yoga asanas as an effective form of experiential learning when teaching musculoskeletal anatomy of the lower limb.	Physical movement as a conduit for experiential learning within the academic context of anatomy is a strategy currently used in university dance education. This same approach can be applied to other movement-based practices, for example, yoga. The primary purpose of this study was to pilot a novel teaching curriculum to yoga practitioners, based on Bruner's Theory of Instruction, which incorporated the four adaptive modes of Kolb's Theory of Experiential Learning. The secondary purpose was to assess the applicability of anatomical knowledge within the participants' yoga practice. Following the development of a curriculum appropriate for a spectrum of academic backgrounds, participants were recruited to attend a 2-hour learning session within the Department of Anatomy at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. The learning session guided participants through the bones and muscles of the lower limb pertaining to five specific yoga poses. Based on participant feedback, the sessions were positively received and consistent. In addition, learning session participants were able to apply the anatomical information they were taught to their yoga practice 1-month later. Bruner and Kolb's independent theories on curriculum design and effective learning practice were successfully incorporated to create a 2-hour learning session. The potential use of experiential learning to compliment and/or enhance traditional didactic teaching in the academic context of anatomy should be further explored.

22537508	Effects of an integrated approach of hatha yoga therapy on functional disability, pain, and flexibility in osteoarthritis of the knee joint: a randomized controlled study.	OBJECTIVES: The study objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of integrating hatha yoga therapy with therapeutic exercises for osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee joints. DESIGN: This was a prospective, randomized, active controlled trial. Two hundred and fifty (250) participants who had OA knees and who were between 35 and 80 years (yoga 59.56+/-9.54) and (control 59.42+/-10.66) from the outpatient department of Ebnezar Orthopedic Center, Bengaluru, were randomly assigned to receive hatha yoga therapy or therapeutic exercises after transcutaneous electrical stimulation and ultrasound treatment (20 minutes per day). Both of the groups practiced supervised interventions (40 minutes per day) for 3 months. One hundred and eighteen (118) (yoga) and 117 (control) subjects were available for the final analysis. RESULTS: There were significant differences within (Wilcoxon's, p<0.001) and between the groups (Mann-Whitney U, p<0.001) on all the variables, with better improvements in the yoga than the control groups. Walking pain in the yoga (37.3%, 64.9%) and control (24.9%, 42%), knee disability in the yoga (59.7%, 83%) and control (32.7%, 53.6%), range of knee flexion in yoga (12.7%, 26.5% right, 13.5%, 28% left) and control (6.9%, 13.3% right, 5.6%, 11.5% left), joint tenderness in yoga (52.3%, 86.1%) and control (28%, 57.1%), swelling in yoga (55.4%, 85.9%) and control (32.1%, 60%), crepitus in yoga (44.0%, 79.9%) and control (27.0%, 47.8%) and walking time in yoga (26.6%, 52.8%) and control (9.3%, 21.6%), all improved more in the yoga than the control groups on the 15th and 90th day, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: An integrated approach of hatha yoga therapy is better than therapeutic exercises as an adjunct to transcutaneous electrical stimulation and ultrasound treatment in improving walking pain, range of knee flexion, walking time, tenderness, swelling, crepitus, and knee disability in patients with OA knees.

22533347	Chair yoga: benefits for community-dwelling older adults with osteoarthritis.	The aim of this pilot study was to examine whether chair yoga was effective in reducing pain level and improving physical function and emotional well-being in a sample of community-dwelling older adults with osteoarthritis. One-way repeated measures analysis of variance was performed to examine the effectiveness of chair yoga at baseline, midpoint (4 weeks), and end of the intervention (8 weeks). Although chair yoga was effective in improving physical function and reducing stiffness in older adults with osteoarthritis, it was not effective in reducing pain level or improving depressive symptoms. Future research planned by this team will use rigorous study methods, including larger samples, randomized controlled trials, and follow up for monitoring home practice after the interventions.

22529651	A comparative clinical study of Shatapatrayadi churna tablet and Patoladi yoga in the management of Amlapitta.	Amlapitta is a very common disease caused by Vidagdha Pitta with features such as Amlodgara, Hrid Kantha Daha, and Avipaka. This is a burning problem of the society. Irregular and improper food habits, and busy stressful lifestyle is one of the main culprit. Amlapitta is the GI disorder described in Ayurvedic texts that closely resembles with Gastritis in modern science. In chronic stage, it may lead to ulcerative conditions. In this study, total 41 patients were registered and were randomly divided into two groups. In group A, Shatapatrayadichurna tablet and in group B Patoladi Yoga tablet were given for 1 month. The Nidana, signs, and symptoms were observed carefully to get idea about the Samprapti of the disease. The effect of Patoladi Yoga on Roga Bala is 65.79%, 62.11% on Agni Bala, and 63.35% on Deha and Chetasa bala. The overall relief was 63.75%. The effect of Shatapatrayadi tablet on Roga Bala was 71.94%, 73.15% on Agni Bala, and 77.68% on Deha and Chetas Bala. The overall relief was 74.25%.

22526771	Practice of yoga may cause damage of both sciatic nerves: a case report.	Sciatic nerve traumatic damage very rarely occurs bilaterally. We describe the case of a 67-year-old woman who reported a bilateral traumatic lesion of the sciatic nerve during practice of yoga. Nerve conduction studies showed a bilateral sciatic nerve neuropathy, mostly affecting the peroneal component. Lumbar plexus MRI documented regular anatomical features of the main principal nerve roots with bilateral T2 signal alteration of roots L4, L5 and S1 that extended into the sciatic nerves showing both increase in size, probably related to chronic injury of nerves, and an alteration in diffusion signal that suggested a recent acute overlapped process.

22525009	Yoga breathing for cancer chemotherapy-associated symptoms and quality of life: results of a pilot randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Many debilitating symptoms arise from cancer and its treatment that are often unrelieved by established methods. Pranayama, a series of yogic breathing techniques, may improve cancer-related symptoms and quality of life, but it has not been studied for this purpose. OBJECTIVES: A pilot study was performed to evaluate feasibility and to test the effects of pranayama on cancer-associated symptoms and quality of life. DESIGN: This was a randomized controlled clinical trial comparing pranayama to usual care. SETTING: The study was conducted at a university medical center. SUBJECTS: Patients receiving cancer chemotherapy were randomized to receive pranayama immediately or after a waiting period (control group). INTERVENTIONS: The pranayama intervention consisted of four breathing techniques taught in weekly classes and practiced at home. The treatment group received pranayama during two consecutive cycles of chemotherapy. The control group received usual care during their first cycle, and received pranayama during their second cycle of chemotherapy. OUTCOME MEASURES: Feasibility, cancer-associated symptoms (fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, stress), and quality of life were the outcomes. RESULTS: Class attendance was nearly 100% in both groups. Sixteen (16) participants were included in the final intent-to-treat analyses. The repeated-measures analyses demonstrated that any increase in pranayama dose, with dose measured in the number of hours practiced in class or at home, resulted in improved symptom and quality-of-life scores. Several of these associations--sleep disturbance (p=0.04), anxiety (p=0.04), and mental quality of life (p=0.05)--reached or approached statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga breathing was a feasible intervention among patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy. Pranayama may improve sleep disturbance, anxiety, and mental quality of life. A dose-response relationship was found between pranayama use and improvements in chemotherapy-associated symptoms and quality of life. These findings need to be confirmed in a larger study.

22517349	Does yoga therapy reduce blood pressure in patients with hypertension?: an integrative review.	The aim of this article was to present a evidence-based integrative research review that validates yoga therapy as an effective complementary treatment in the management of high blood pressure (BP). The article also uses the theoretical framework of Dr Hans Selye's general adaptation syndrome. Yoga researchers demonstrate that yoga works because it modulates the physiological system of the body, specifically its effect on the heart rate. This review is significant because yoga presents an effective method of treating hypertension that is nonpharmacologic and therefore there are no adverse effects and there are other valuable health benefits. Research suggests that stress is a contributing factor to high BP; hence, the use of the general adaptation syndrome and the most important attribute of yoga, that is, it is a physical and mental exercise program, that is in sync with the philosophy of holistic nursing care where one treats the whole individual and not just the disease. The review was conducted with a search of computerized databases such as OVID, Academic Search Premier, CINAHL, MEDLINE, and Health Source: Nursing/Academic edition, PsychINFO, as well as reliable Web sites such as the cdc.gov, among others. An integrative review search was conducted, and 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. They include a combination of randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and pilot studies. Yoga therapy is a multifunctional exercise modality with numerous benefits. Not only does yoga reduce high BP but it has also been demonstrated to effectively reduce blood glucose level, cholesterol level, and body weight, major problems affecting the American society. The completed integrative review provides guidelines for nursing implementation as a complementary treatment of high BP.	Okonta, Nkechi Rose	2012 May-Jun
22507264	Effect of a yoga program on glucose metabolism and blood lipid levels in adolescent girls with polycystic ovary syndrome.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of yoga therapy on glucose metabolism and blood lipid values in adolescent girls with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). METHODS: A prospective, randomized, interventional controlled trial recruited 90 adolescents aged between 15 and 18 years who met the Rotterdam criteria for PCOS. A yoga group practiced suryanamaskara, asanas, pranayama, and meditation 1 hour per day each day for 12 weeks while another group practiced conventional physical exercises. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare score changes between the 2 groups. RESULTS: The changes in fasting insulin, fasting blood glucose, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance were significantly different in the 2 groups (P<0.05). Except for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the changes in blood lipid values were also significantly different (P<0.05). The changes in body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio, however, were not significantly different (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Yoga was found to be more effective than conventional physical exercises in improving glucose, lipid, and insulin values, including insulin resistance values, in adolescent girls with PCOS independent of anthropometric changes.

22502620	The effects of yoga on anxiety and stress.	Stress and anxiety have been implicated as contributors to many chronic diseases and to decreased quality of life, even with pharmacologic treatment. Efforts are underway to find non-pharmacologic therapies to relieve stress and anxiety, and yoga is one option for which results are promising. The focus of this review is on the results of human trials assessing the role of yoga in improving the signs and symptoms of stress and anxiety. Of 35 trials addressing the effects of yoga on anxiety and stress, 25 noted a significant decrease in stress and/or anxiety symptoms when a yoga regimen was implemented; however, many of the studies were also hindered by limitations, such as small study populations, lack of randomization, and lack of a control group. Fourteen of the 35 studies reported biochemical and physiological markers of stress and anxiety, but yielded inconsistent support of yoga for relief of stress and anxiety. Evaluation of the current primary literature is suggestive of benefits of yoga in relieving stress and anxiety, but further investigation into this relationship using large, well-defined populations, adequate controls, randomization and long duration should be explored before recommending yoga as a treatment option.

22500659	A comprehensive yoga programs improves pain, anxiety and depression in chronic low back pain patients more than exercise: an RCT.	INTRODUCTION: Previously, outpatient Yoga programs for patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) lasting several months have been found to reduce pain, analgesic requirement and disability, and improve spinal mobility. This study evaluated changes in pain, anxiety, depression and spinal mobility for CLBP patients on short-term, residential Yoga and physical exercise programs, including comprehensive yoga lifestyle modifications. METHODS: A seven day randomized control single blind active study in an residential Holistic Health Centre in Bangalore, India, assigned 80 patients (37 female, 43 male) with CLBP to yoga and physical exercise groups. The Yoga program consisted of specific asanas and pranayamas for back pain, meditation, yogic counselling, and lectures on yoga philosophy. The control group program included physical therapy exercises for back pain, and matching counselling and education sessions. RESULTS: Groupxtime interactions (p<0.05) and between group differences (p<0.05) were significant in all variables. Both groups' scores on the numerical rating scale for pain reduced significantly, 49% in Yoga (p<0.001, ES=1.62), 17.5% in controls (p=0.005, ES=0.67). State anxiety (STAI) reduced 20.4% (p<0.001, ES=0.72) and trait anxiety 16% (p<0.001, ES=1.09) in the yoga group. Depression (BDI) decreased in both groups, 47% in yoga (p<0.001, ES=0.96,) and 19.9% in controls (p<0.001, ES=0.59). Spinal mobility ('Sit and Reach' instrument) improved in both groups, 50%, in yoga (p<0.001, ES=2.99) and 34.6% in controls (p<0.001, ES=0.81). CONCLUSION: Seven days intensive residential Yoga program reduces pain, anxiety, and depression, and improves spinal mobility in patients with CLBP more effectively than physiotherapy exercises.

22498305	Knowledge about complementary, alternative and integrative medicine (CAM) among registered health care providers in Swedish surgical care: a national survey among university hospitals.	BACKGROUND: Previous studies show an increased interest and usage of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in the general population and among health care workers both internationally and nationally. CAM usage is also reported to be common among surgical patients. Earlier international studies have reported that a large amount of surgical patients use it prior to and after surgery. Recent publications indicate a weak knowledge about CAM among health care workers. However the current situation in Sweden is unknown. The aim of this study was therefore to explore perceived knowledge about CAM among registered healthcare professions in surgical departments at Swedish university hospitals. METHOD: A questionnaire was distributed to 1757 registered physicians, nurses and physiotherapists in surgical wards at the seven university hospitals in Sweden from spring 2010 to spring 2011. The questionnaire included classification of 21 therapies into conventional, complementary, alternative and integrative, and whether patients were recommended these therapies. Questions concerning knowledge, research, and patient communication about CAM were also included. RESULT: A total of 737 (42.0%) questionnaires were returned. Therapies classified as complementary; were massage, manual therapies, yoga and acupuncture. Alternative therapies; were herbal medicine, dietary supplements, homeopathy and healing. Classification to integrative therapy was low, and unfamiliar therapies were Bowen therapy, iridology and Rosen method. Therapies recommended by > 40% off the participants were massage and acupuncture. Knowledge and research about CAM was valued as minor or none at all by 95.7% respectively 99.2%. Importance of possessing knowledge about it was valued as important by 80.9%. It was believed by 61.2% that more research funding should be addressed to CAM research, 72.8% were interested in reading CAM-research results, and 27.8% would consider taking part in such research. Half of the participants (55.8%) were positive to learning such therapy. Communication about CAM between patients and the health care professions was found to be rare. CONCLUSION: There is a lack of knowledge about CAM and research about it among registered health care professions in Swedish surgical care. However, in contrast to previous studies the results revealed that the majority perceived it as important to gain knowledge in this field.

22486714	Yoga in schizophrenia: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials.	OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of yoga as a complementary treatment on general psychopathology, positive and negative symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQL) for people with schizophrenia. METHOD: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were considered whether they investigated a yoga intervention in patients with schizophrenia. The selection of studies, data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. RESULTS: Only three RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Lower Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores and subscale scores for positive and negative symptoms were obtained after yoga compared with exercise or waiting list control conditions. In the same way, the physical, psychological, social and environmental HRQL as measured with the abbreviated version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF) increased more significantly after yoga than after exercise or waiting list control conditions. None of the RCTS encountered adverse events. Dose-response relationships could, however, not be determined. CONCLUSION: Although the number of RCTs included in this review was limited, results indicated that yoga therapy can be an useful add-on treatment to reduce general psychopathology and positive and negative symptoms. In the same way, HRQL improved in those antipsychotic-stabilised patients with schizophrenia following yoga.

22483229	Modular and scalable load-wall sled buck for pure-lateral and oblique side impact tests.	A considerable majority of side impact sled tests using different types of human surrogates has used a load-wall design not specific to subject anthropometry. The use of one load-wall configuration cannot accurately isolate and evaluate regional responses for the same load-wall geometry. As the anatomy and biomechanical responses of the human torso depends on the region, and anthropomorphic test devices continue to advance and accommodate regional differences, it is important to obtain specific data from sled tests. To achieve this goal, the present study designed a scalable modular load-wall consisting of the shoulder, thorax, abdomen, and superior and inferior pelvis, and lower limb plates. The first five plates were connected to a vertical fixture and the limb plate was connected to another fixture. The width, height, and thickness, and the gap between plates were modular. Independent adjustments in the coronal and sagittal planes allowed region-specific positioning depending on surrogate anthropometry, example pelvis width and seated height. Two tri-axial load cells were fixed on the contralateral face of each plate of the load-wall to record impact force-time histories. The load-wall and vertical fixture design can be used to conduct side impact tests with varying vectors, pure-lateral to anterior and posterior oblique, by appropriately orienting the load-wall with respect to the surrogate. The feasibility of the design to extract region-specific biomechanical data was demonstrated by conducting pure-lateral and anterior oblique sled tests using two different surrogates at a velocity of 6.7m/s. Uses of this design are discussed for different applications.	Yoganandan, Narayan;Humm, John R;Pintar, Frank A	2012 May 11
22474497	The Effects of a Gentle Yoga Program on Sleep, Mood, and Blood Pressure in Older Women with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS): A Preliminary Randomized Controlled Trial.	Objective. To examine the effects of yoga versus an educational film program on sleep, mood, perceived stress, and sympathetic activation in older women with RLS. Methods. Participants were drawn from a larger trial regarding the effects of yoga on cardiovascular disease risk profiles in overweight, sedentary postmenopausal women. Seventy-five women were randomized to receive either an 8-week yoga (n = 38) or educational film (n = 37) program. All 75 participants completed an RLS screening questionnaire. The 20 women who met all four diagnostic criteria for RLS (n = 10 yoga, 10 film group) comprised the population for this nested study. Main outcomes assessed pre- and post-treatment included: sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), stress (Perceived Stress Scale), mood (Profile of Mood States, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), blood pressure, and heart rate. Results. The yoga group demonstrated significantly greater improvements than controls in multiple domains of sleep quality and mood, and significantly greater reductions in insomnia prevalence, anxiety, perceived stress, and blood pressure (all P's</=0.05). Adjusted intergroup effect sizes for psychosocial variables were large, ranging from 1.9 for state anxiety to 2.6 for sleep quality. Conclusions. These preliminary findings suggest yoga may offer an effective intervention for improving sleep, mood, perceived stress, and blood pressure in older women with RLS.	Innes, Kim E;Selfe, Terry Kit	2012

22464118	Yoga and massage therapy reduce prenatal depression and prematurity.	Eighty-four prenatally depressed women were randomly assigned to yoga, massage therapy or standard prenatal care control groups to determine the relative effects of yoga and massage therapy on prenatal depression and neonatal outcomes. Following 12 weeks of twice weekly yoga or massage therapy sessions (20 min each) both therapy groups versus the control group had a greater decrease on depression, anxiety and back and leg pain scales and a greater increase on a relationship scale. In addition, the yoga and massage therapy groups did not differ on neonatal outcomes including gestational age and birthweight, and those groups, in turn, had greater gestational age and birthweight than the control group.

22448849	Yoga spinal flexion positions and vertebral compression fracture in osteopenia or osteoporosis of spine: case series.	OBJECTIVE: The objective of this report is to raise awareness of the effect of strenuous yoga flexion exercises on osteopenic or osteoporotic spines. We previously described subjects with known osteoporosis in whom vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) developed after spinal flexion exercise (SFE) and recommended that SFEs not be prescribed in patients with spinal osteoporosis. METHODS: This report describes 3 healthy persons with low bone mass and yoga-induced pain or fracture. RESULTS: All 3 patients had osteopenia, were in good health and pain-free, and had started yoga exercises to improve their musculoskeletal health. New pain and fracture areas occurred after participation in yoga flexion exercises. CONCLUSIONS: The development of pain and complications with some flexion yoga positions in the patients with osteopenia leads to concern that fracture risk would increase even further in osteoporosis. Although exercise has been shown to be effective for improving bone mineral density and decreasing fracture risk, our subjects had development of VCFs and neck and back pain with yoga exercises. This finding suggests that factors other than bone mass should be considered for exercise counseling in patients with bone loss. The increased torque pressure applied to vertebral bodies during SFEs may be a risk. Exercise is effective and important for treatment of osteopenia and osteoporosis and should be prescribed for patients with vertebral bone loss. Some yoga positions can contribute to extreme strain on spines with bone loss. Assessment of fracture risk in older persons performing SFEs and other high-impact exercises is an important clinical consideration.	Sinaki, Mehrsheed	2013 Jan
22441406	Effect of Nurses Living Fit exercise and nutrition intervention on body mass index in nurses.	OBJECTIVE: The hospital-based Nurses Living Fit (NLF) intervention was implemented by nurses to determine its effect on decreasing body mass index (BMI) in nurse participants. BACKGROUND: Although there are limited data on obesity rates of nurses working in the United States, more than half are estimated to be overweight or obese. METHODS: The NLF intervention included exercise (12 weekly sessions), yoga and nutrition (4 monthly sessions), and diary completion (exercise/yoga, food/water consumption, and sleep), addressing healthy lifestyle principles. RESULTS: NLF participants experienced a greater mean reduction in BMI and waist circumference inches. Ninety-three percent of NLF participants recommended the NLF program. CONCLUSIONS: Provision of an evidence-based program such as NLF facilitates nurse education on healthy lifestyle principles.

22433499	A pragmatic multicentered randomized controlled trial of yoga for chronic low back pain: economic evaluation.	STUDY DESIGN: Multicentered randomized controlled trial with quality of life and resource use data collected. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of yoga intervention plus usual care compared with usual care alone for chronic or recurrent low back pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Yoga has been shown as an effective intervention for treating chronic or recurrent low back pain. However, there is little evidence on its cost-effectiveness. The data are extracted from a pragmatic, multicentered, randomized controlled trial that has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a 12-week progressive program of yoga plus usual care in patients with chronic or recurrent low back pain. METHODS: With this trial data, a cost-effectiveness analysis during the time period of 12 months from both perspectives of the UK National Health Service and the societal is presented. Main outcome measure is an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: From the perspective of the U.K. National Health Service, yoga intervention yields an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound13,606 per QALY. Given a willingness to pay for an additional QALY of pound20,000, the probability of yoga intervention being cost-effective is 72%. From the perspective of the society, yoga intervention is a dominant treatment compared with usual care alone. This result is surrounded by fewer uncertainties-the probability of yoga being cost-effective reaches 95% at a willingness to pay for an additional QALY of pound20,000. Sensitive analyses suggest the same results that yoga intervention is likely to be cost-effective in both perspectives. CONCLUSION: On the basis of this trial, 12 weekly group classes of specialized yoga are likely to be a cost-effective intervention for treating patients with chronic or recurrent low back pain.

22414074	Clinical service desires of medical cannabis patients.	BACKGROUND: Medical cannabis dispensaries following the social or hybrid model offer supplementary holistic services in addition to dispensing medical cannabis. Historically, alternative physical health services have been the norm for these dispensaries, including services such as yoga, acupuncture, or chiropractor visits. A clinical service dearth remains for medical cannabis patients seeking substance use, misuse, dependence, and mental health services. This study examined patient desires for various clinical services and level of willingness to participate in specific clinical services. METHODS: Anonymous survey data (N = 303) were collected at Harborside Health Center (HHC), a medical cannabis dispensary in Oakland, CA. The sample was 70% male, 48% Caucasian and 21% African American. The mean male age was 38 years old and female mean age was 30. Sixty two percent of the male participants and 44% of the female participants are single. Sixteen percent of the population reported having a domestic partner. Forty six percent of the participants are employed full time, 41% have completed at least some college, and 49% make less than $40,000 a year. RESULTS: A significant portion of the sample, 62%, indicated a desire to participate in free clinical services at HHC, 34% would like more information about substances and use, and 41% want to learn more about reducing harms from substance use. About one quarter of the participants marked "would" or "likely would" participate in individual services such as consultation. Approximately 20% indicated "would" or "likely would" participate in psycho-educational forums, harm reduction information sharing sessions, online support groups, and coping, life, and social skills group. There was little interest in traditional NA/AA 12-step groups or adapted 12-step groups. CONCLUSIONS: Desired clinical services can be qualified as a combination of harm reduction, educational, skills-based, peer support and therapeutic individual and group services. Results suggest that medical cannabis patients seek more information about various substances, including cannabis. Dispensaries can help to decrease gaps in substance education and clinical services and fulfill unmet clinical desires. More research is necessary in additional medical cannabis dispensaries in different geographic settings with different service delivery models.	Janichek, Jennifer L;Reiman, Amanda	2012 Mar 13
22408332	Exercise beyond menopause: Dos and Don'ts.	With a significant number of women belonging to the status of menopause and beyond, it is imperative to plan a comprehensive health program for them, including lifestyle modifications. Exercise is an integral part of the strategy. The benefits are many, most important being maintenance of muscle mass and thereby the bone mass and strength. The exercise program for postmenopausal women should include the endurance exercise (aerobic), strength exercise and balance exercise; it should aim for two hours and 30 minutes of moderate aerobic activity each week. Every woman should be aware of her target heart rate range and should track the intensity of exercise employing the talk test. Other deep breathing, yoga and stretching exercises can help to manage the stress of life and menopause-related symptoms. Exercises for women with osteoporosis should not include high impact aerobics or activities in which a fall is likely. The women and the treating medical practitioner should also be aware of the warning symptoms and contraindications regarding exercise prescription in women beyond menopause. The role of exercise in hot flashes, however, remains inconclusive. Overall, exercising beyond menopause is the only noncontroversial and beneficial aspect of lifestyle modification and must be opted by all.	Mishra, Nalini;Mishra, V N;Devanshi	2011 Jul
22408306	Clinical efficacy of "Bhadra Mustadi Paste" and "Nagaradi Kwatha Gandusha" in Shitada (Gingivitis).	Shitada is one of the Dantamulagata Rogas mentioned by Acarya Susruta under the heading of Mukha Rogas. It is characterized by symptoms like spontaneous bleeding, halitosis, blackish discoloration of gums, and so on. The symptomatology of Shitada can be compared with gingivitis, which is caused mainly by the accumulation of debris, plaque, and calculus at the tooth margin due to ignorance of oral care. It can progress into periodontitis - the disease in which the firmness, contour, and position of the gums are altered and teeth become mobile. The prevalence of gingivitis is as high as 50% in most of the population. In the present study, a total of 33 patients were registered in three groups. Bhadramustadi yoga has been used in paste form for local application along with Nagaradi Kwatha Gandusa in Group A and in powder form for Pratisarana along with Nagaradi Kwatha Gandusa in Group B. In Group C (Control) Sphatika Jala was used. The patients were diagnosed and assessed on the basis of Ayurvedic as well as modern classical signs and symptoms. Further assessment was done with the different indices used in modern dentistry. All the signs and symptoms were given a score depending upon the severity, to assess the effect of the drugs objectively. The effect of therapy was highly significant in group A in most of the signs, symptoms, and indices; and in group B it was highly significant in some signs and symptoms.

22408304	Clinical effect of Nirgundi Patra pinda sweda and Ashwagandhadi Guggulu Yoga in the management of Sandhigata Vata (Osteoarthritis).	Sandhigata Vata is one among the 80 Nanatmaja Vata Vyadhies. Sandhigata Vata and Osteoarthritis have common symptoms, and hence, both are considered as similar entities by a majority of Ayurvedic scholars and same has been adopted here. Osteoarthritis is the most common joint disease among human beings today. In this study, a total of 116 patients were registered, out of them 101 patients had completed the full course of treatment, while 15 patients left against medical advice. The 101 patients of Sandhigata Vata were treated in two groups. Group A: In this group 50 patients of Sandhigata Vata were treated with Nirgundi Patra pinda sweda for 21 days and Ashwagandhadi Guggulu Yoga3 g/day for 45 days was given orally. Group B: In this group 51 patients of Sandhigata Vata were treated with only Ashwagandhadi Guggulu Yoga 3 g/day for 45 days. To assess the effect of the therapy objectively, all the signs and symptoms of Sandhigata Vata were given a score, depending upon their severity. Also functional tests like walking time, climbing stairs, and joint movement, were measured as a criteria for assessment. Both the groups showed good results, but Group B showed better results in comparison to group A.	Joshi, Alpesh;Mehta, Charmi S;Dave, Alankruta R;Shukla, V D	2011 Apr
22407663	A pilot study of yogic meditation for family dementia caregivers with depressive symptoms: effects on mental health, cognition, and telomerase activity.	BACKGROUND: This study examined the effects of brief daily yogic meditation on mental health, cognitive functioning, and immune cell telomerase activity in family dementia caregivers with mild depressive symptoms. METHODS: Thirty-nine family dementia caregivers (mean age 60.3 years old (SD = 10.2)) were randomized to practicing Kirtan Kriya or listening to relaxation music for 12 min per day for 8 weeks. The severity of depressive symptoms, mental and cognitive functioning were assessed at baseline and follow-up. Telomerase activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBC) was examined in peripheral PBMC pre-intervention and post-intervention. RESULTS: The meditation group showed significantly lower levels of depressive symptoms and greater improvement in mental health and cognitive functioning compared with the relaxation group. In the meditation group, 65.2% showed 50% improvement on the Hamilton Depression Rating scale and 52% of the participants showed 50% improvement on the Mental Health Composite Summary score of the Short Form-36 scale compared with 31.2% and 19%, respectively, in the relaxation group (p < 0.05). The meditation group showed 43% improvement in telomerase activity compared with 3.7% in the relaxation group (p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: This pilot study found that brief daily meditation practices by family dementia caregivers can lead to improved mental and cognitive functioning and lower levels of depressive symptoms. This improvement is accompanied by an increase in telomerase activity suggesting improvement in stress-induced cellular aging. These results need to be confirmed in a larger sample.

22399208	Yoga during pregnancy: a review.	The purpose of this review article is to evaluate the peripartum outcomes of yoga during pregnancy, including the postpartum period and lactation. The PubMed database was analyzed from January 1970 to January 2011. We identified five prospective observational studies (n = 575) and three randomized clinical trials (RCTs; n = 298), which were analyzed separately. The nonrandomized trials indicated a significant reduction in rates of preterm labor (p < 0.0006), intrauterine growth retardation (p <0.003), low birth weight (p < 0.01), pregnancy discomforts (p = 0.01), and perceived sleep disturbances (p = 0.03) in those who practiced yoga during pregnancy. Results of the RCTs indicated that doing yoga during pregnancy can significantly lower pain and discomfort (p < 0.05) and perceived stress (p = 0.001) and improve quality of life in physical domains (p = 0.001). All three RCTs were poorly compliant with the Consolidated Standard of Reporting Trials statement. While awaiting an appropriately designed RCT to determine the benefits of yoga during pregnancy, it remains a viable exercise option.	Babbar, Shilpa;Parks-Savage, Agatha C;Chauhan, Suneet P	2012 Jun

22396225	Hypertension Analysis of stress Reduction using Mindfulness meditatiON and Yoga (The HARMONY Study): study protocol of a randomised control trial.	INTRODUCTION: Hypertension (HTN) is a leading risk factor for preventable cardiovascular disease, with over one in five adults affected worldwide. Lifestyle modification is a key strategy for the prevention and treatment of HTN. Stress has been associated with greater cardiovascular risk, and stress management is a recommended intervention for hypertensives. Stress reduction through relaxation therapies has been shown to have an effect on human physiology, including lowering blood pressure (BP). However, individualised behavioural interventions are resource intensive, and group stress management approaches have not been validated for reducing HTN. The HARMONY Study is a pilot randomised controlled trial designed to determine if mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a standardised group therapy, is an effective intervention for lowering BP in stage 1 unmedicated hypertensives. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Men and women unmedicated for HTN with mean daytime ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) >/=135/85 mm Hg or 24 h ABP >/=130/80 mm Hg are included in the study. Subjects are randomised to receive MBSR immediately or after a wait-list control period. The primary outcome measure is mean awake and 24 h ABP. The primary objective of the HARMONY Study is to compare ABP between the treatment and wait-list control arm at the 12-week primary assessment period. Results from this study will determine if MBSR is an effective intervention for lowering BP in early unmedicated hypertensives. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This research project was approved by the Sunnybrook Research Ethics Board and the University Health Network Research Ethics Board (Toronto, Canada). Planned analyses are in full compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Data collection will be completed by early spring 2012. Primary and secondary analysis will commence immediately after data monitoring is completed; dissemination plans include preparing publications for submission during the summer of 2012. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: This study is registered with http://clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00825526).

22389940	Effects of sensory-enhanced yoga on symptoms of combat stress in deployed military personnel.	OBJECTIVE: We examined the effects of sensory-enhanced hatha yoga on symptoms of combat stress in deployed military personnel, compared their anxiety and sensory processing with that of stateside civilians, and identified any correlations between the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory scales and the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile quadrants. METHOD: Seventy military personnel who were deployed to Iraq participated in a randomized controlled trial. Thirty-five received 3 wk (>/=9 sessions) of sensory-enhanced hatha yoga, and 35 did not receive any form of yoga. RESULTS: Sensory-enhanced hatha yoga was effective in reducing state and trait anxiety, despite normal pretest scores. Treatment participants showed significantly greater improvement than control participants on 16 of 18 mental health and quality-of-life factors. We found positive correlations between all test measures except sensory seeking. Sensory seeking was negatively correlated with all measures except low registration, which was insignificant. CONCLUSION: The results support using sensory-enhanced hatha yoga for proactive combat stress management.	Stoller, Carolyn C;Greuel, Joh H;Cimini, Lucy S;Fowler, Mary S;Koomar, Jane A	2012 Jan-Feb
22385567	Longitudinal impact of yoga on chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment and quality of life in women with early stage breast cancer: a case series.	PURPOSE: Adjuvant chemotherapy for women with breast cancer has significantly improved the cure rate; however, it has been associated with chemotherapy-related cognitive impact (CRCI). The literature provides preliminary support for the feasibility and efficacy of yoga interventions for the general cancer population, however, controlled trials are scarce and no studies have examined the effect of yoga on cognition for women with breast cancer during chemotherapy. This case series aims to identify the impact of yoga on measures of cognition, functional outcomes, and quality of life (QOL) for breast cancer survivors (BCS). METHODS: Four women with a diagnosis of early-stage breast cancer prior to chemotherapy treatment were administered the following physiologic measures at baseline, 6, and 12 weeks during chemotherapy, and at one and three months after the conclusion of the study: Functional Reach test (balance) and Sit and Reach test (flexibility), and QOL, POMS (Mood) and FACT-B (QOL), at baseline. Primary outcomes of cognition were measured with the Perceived Cognition Questionnaire (PCQ) and CogState, a computerized measurement of cognition. Women attended an Iyengar-inspired yoga program twice a week for 12 weeks. Qualitative questionnaires were administered after the completion of the study to determine perceived benefits and challenges of the yoga program. RESULTS: Four women with Stage II breast cancer ranged in age from 44-65 years. CogState computerized testing showed changes in varying domains of cognition through treatment and follow-up. Improved balance, flexibility, and QOL were also noted over time. No adverse events were observed. Analysis of qualitative data revealed the yoga classes were helpful and subjects continued the practice elements of yoga including relaxation, breathing, and stretching. The most challenging aspect of the study was physical limitations due to various medical complications and included fatigue, decreased range of motion, and pain. CONCLUSION: This case series suggests that yoga may impact various aspects of cognition during and after chemotherapy administration as noted through quantitative measures. Women describe yoga as improving various domains of QOL through the treatment trajectory. This mind-body intervention may stave off CRCI; however, further investigation is needed for additional randomized controlled trials on the effects of yoga on cognition for women with breast cancer undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy treatment.

22375247	How effective is sun salutation in improving muscle strength, general body endurance and body composition?	PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate effects of regular practice of sun salutation on muscle strength, general body endurance and body composition. METHODS: Subjects (49 male and 30 female) performed 24 cycles of sun salutation, 6 days a week for 24 weeks. Upper body muscle strength was determined by 1 repetition maximum (1RM) for bench press and shoulder press technique. Back and leg dynamometry was used to assess strength of back and leg muscles. General body endurance was evaluated by push-up and sit-up tests. Body composition was assessed by noting% body fat by using bioelectric impedance analysis. Perceived intensity of exercise by subjects was noted by Borg scale. RESULTS: Muscle strength by bench press showed significant increase in male (29.49+/-9.70 to 36.12+/-9.09 Kg, P<0.001) and female (10.5+/-4.42 to 13.16+/-4.44 Kg, P<0.001) subjects. Strength by shoulder press also increased (males; 22.96+/-9.57 Kg to 26.53+/-11.05 Kg, P<0.001, females; 6.83+/-2.78 to 8.83+/-3.87, P<0.001). Endurance by push-ups & sit-ups showed similar findings in male (19.0+/-9.58 to 21.98+/-8.98, P<0.001 and 24.92+/-10.41 to 29.84+/-12.64, P<0.001 respectively) and female (14.66+/-6.80 to 18.56+/-6.97 and 13.16+/-7.75 to 19.23+/-8.25, P<0.001 respectively) subjects. A significant decrease in body fat percent was observed only in female (27.68+/-5.46 to 25.76+/-4.72, P<0.001) but not in male subjects. BMI significantly decreased in both the groups (z=4.37, P<001 and t=5.41, P<0.001 respectively). CONCLUSION: From our observations we conclude that sun salutation can be an ideal exercise to keep oneself in optimum level of fitness.

22365651	Effects of yoga on the autonomic nervous system, gamma-aminobutyric-acid, and allostasis in epilepsy, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder.	A theory is proposed to explain the benefits of yoga practices in diverse, frequently comorbid medical conditions based on the concept that yoga practices reduce allostatic load in stress response systems such that optimal homeostasis is restored. It is hypothesized that stress induces (1) imbalance of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) with decreased parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) and increased sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, (2) underactivity of the gamma amino-butyric acid (GABA) system, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter system, and (3) increased allostatic load. It is further hypothesized that yoga-based practices (4) correct underactivity of the PNS and GABA systems in part through stimulation of the vagus nerves, the main peripheral pathway of the PNS, and (5) reduce allostatic load. Depression, epilepsy, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and chronic pain exemplify medical conditions that are exacerbated by stress, have low heart rate variability (HRV) and low GABAergic activity, respond to pharmacologic agents that increase activity of the GABA system, and show symptom improvement in response to yoga-based interventions. The observation that treatment resistant cases of epilepsy and depression respond to vagal nerve stimulation corroborates the need to correct PNS underactivity as part of a successful treatment plan in some cases. According to the proposed theory, the decreased PNS and GABAergic activity that underlies stress-related disorders can be corrected by yoga practices resulting in amelioration of disease symptoms. This has far-reaching implications for the integration of yoga-based practices in the treatment of a broad array of disorders exacerbated by stress.

23641315	Yoga Empowers Seniors Study (YESS): Design and Asana Series.	The practice of yoga asanas (postures) may be an optimal method of preserving or enhancing physical function in older men and women. However, the physical demands, efficacy and safety of an asana practice for seniors have not been well studied. The Yoga Empowers Seniors Study (YESS) is an intervention development study that created two senior-adapted series of asanas targeted for an ambulatory older population. YESS is using biomechanics and physical performance tests to acquire information about the physical demands placed on the muscles and joints by the asanas and the functional performance adaptations resulting from the yoga practice. This manuscript details the standardized, senior-adapted, YESS asana series and the additional asana modifications provided when participants had physical limitations. This presentation will enable the yoga research and teaching communities to interpret the biomechanics, physical performance and side effects outcomes of YESS.

22354118	Reporting an alliance using an integrative approach to the management of lymphedema in India.	In India 553 million persons are estimated to live in areas endemic for LF; approximately 21 million have symptomatic filariasis. Of the approximately 16.02 million cases of lymphedema caused by LF globally, 7.44 million (46.4%) are in India. India had seen diethyl carbamizine, and/or albendazole, delivered to whole populations, beginning the project to eliminate the disease. But new populations have developed the infection. In 2003 the need in resource-poor countries for morbidity control of lymphatic filariasis (LF) became clear, prompting the study by the Institute of Applied Dermatology in Kerala, India. Under this study,self help and family members assisted in home-based care, combining compression bandaging, yoga exercises, heat therapy using steaming, and skin care according to Ayurvedic medicine. Lymphedema presents with different patterns in the skin with gross changes in the epidermis, dermis, or subcutaneous tissue. Skilled and time-consuming counselling is important to give patients support. An almost immediate reduction in inflammatory episodes from 80.4% to 8.6% shows up within 2 or 3 weeks, and therefore, intake of antibiotics can be stopped. The second major response is reduction in the size of the limb. Volume reduction for large-sized limbs at 3 months is 39%, with a confidence interval of 4.9 to 5.9 L.

22352291	Effective and viable mind-body stress reduction in the workplace: a randomized controlled trial.	Highly stressed employees are subject to greater health risks, increased cost, and productivity losses than those with normal stress levels. To address this issue in an evidence-based manner, worksite stress management programs must be able to engage individuals as well as capture data on stress, health indices, work productivity, and health care costs. In this randomized controlled pilot, our primary objective was to evaluate the viability and proof of concept for two mind-body workplace stress reduction programs (one therapeutic yoga-based and the other mindfulness-based), in order to set the stage for larger cost-effectiveness trials. A second objective was to evaluate 2 delivery venues of the mindfulness-based intervention (online vs. in-person). Intention-to-treat principles and 2 (pre and post) x 3 (group) repeated-measures analysis of covariance procedures examined group differences over time on perceived stress and secondary measures to clarify which variables to include in future studies: sleep quality, mood, pain levels, work productivity, mindfulness, blood pressure, breathing rate, and heart rate variability (a measure of autonomic balance). Two hundred and thirty-nine employee volunteers were randomized into a therapeutic yoga worksite stress reduction program, 1 of 2 mindfulness-based programs, or a control group that participated only in assessment. Compared with the control group, the mind-body interventions showed significantly greater improvements on perceived stress, sleep quality, and the heart rhythm coherence ratio of heart rate variability. The two delivery venues for the mindfulness program produced basically equivalent results. Both the mindfulness-based and therapeutic yoga programs may provide viable and effective interventions to target high stress levels, sleep quality, and autonomic balance in employees.

22350253	Efficacy and safety of meditative movement therapies in fibromyalgia syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.	A systematic review with meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of meditative movement therapies (Qigong, Tai Chi and Yoga) in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) was carried out. We screened Clinicaltrials.Gov, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, PubMed and Scopus (through December 2010) and the reference sections of original studies for meditative movement therapies (MMT) in FMS. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing MMT to controls were analysed. Outcomes of efficacy were pain, sleep, fatigue, depression and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Effects were summarized using standardized mean differences (SMD [95% confidence interval]). Outcomes of safety were drop out because of adverse events and serious adverse events. A total of 7 out of 117 studies with 362 subjects and a median of 12 sessions (range 8-24) were included. MMT reduced sleep disturbances (-0.61 [-0.95, -0.27]; 0.0004), fatigue (-0.66 [-0.99, -0.34]; <0.0001), depression (-0.49 [-0.76, -0.22]; 0.0004) and limitations of HRQOL (-0.59 [-0.93, -0.24]; 0.0009), but not pain (-0.35 [-0.80, 0.11]; 0.14) compared to controls at final treatment. The significant effects on sleep disturbances (-0.52 [-0.97, -0.07]; 0.02) and HRQOL (-0.66 [-1.31, -0.01]; 0.05) could be maintained after a median of 4.5 (range 3-6) months. In subgroup analyses, only Yoga yielded significant effects on pain, fatigue, depression and HRQOL at final treatment. Drop out rate because of adverse events was 3.1%. No serious adverse events were reported. MMT are safe. Yoga had short-term beneficial effects on some key domains of FMS. There is a need for high-quality studies with larger sample sizes to confirm the results.	Langhorst, Jost;Klose, Petra;Dobos, Gustav J;Bernardy, Kathrin;Hauser, Winfried	2013 Jan

22346070	Barriers to yoga therapy as an add-on treatment for schizophrenia in India.	AIM: To describe the possible barriers to yoga therapy for patients with schizophrenia in India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a randomized control trial at NIMHANS, patients with schizophrenia (on stable doses of antipsychotics, 18-60 years of age, with a Clinical Global Impression-Severity score of 3 or more) were randomized into one of three limbs: Yoga therapy, physical exercise and waitlist. Of 857 patients screened, 392 (45.7%) patients were found eligible for the study. Among them, 223 (56.8%) declined to take part in the trial. The primary reasons for declining were analyzed. RESULTS: The primary reasons for declining were (a) distance from the center (n=83; 37.2%); (b) no one to accompany them for training (n=25; 11.2%); (c) busy work schedule (n=21, 9.4%); (d) unwilling to come for one month (n=11; 4.9%), (e) not willing for yoga therapy (n=9, 4.0%); (f) personal reasons (n=3, 1.3%); (g) religious reasons (n=1, 0.4%). In 70 patients (31.6%), no reasons were ascribed. No patient refused citing research nature of the intervention as a reason. CONCLUSION: More than half of the patients eligible for yoga did not consent to the study. Logistic factors, such as the need for daily training under supervision in a specialized center for long periods, are the most important barriers that prevent patients with schizophrenia from receiving yoga therapy.

22346069	Influence of alternate nostril breathing on heart rate variability in non-practitioners of yogic breathing.	BACKGROUND: Long-term alternate nostril breathing (ANB) has been shown to enhance autonomic control of the heart by increasing parasympathetic modulation. However, there is no information on the immediate effects of ANB on autonomic control compared to paced breathing (PB) at the same rate in individuals who are inexperienced with yogic breathing. AIM: To examine cardiac autonomic modulation following ANB in comparison to that following PB in individuals who were inexperienced in ANB. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty healthy individuals (22.3 +/- 2.9 years) with no prior experience with ANB engaged in RESULTS: Analysis of covariance revealed lnTP, lnLF and lnHF were greater during both post-ANB and post-PB compared to PRE (P<0.05). MAP and lnLF/lnHF did not significantly differ between conditions. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that there was an immediate increase in cardiac autonomic modulation following ANB and PB without a shift in autonomic balance in individuals inexperienced with yogic breathing. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation to investigate the autonomic effects of ANB in this population and also to compare the effects of ANB and PB at the same respiratory rate.

22346068	A multicomponent yoga-based, breath intervention program as an adjunctive treatment in patients suffering from generalized anxiety disorder with or without comorbidities.	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) course in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) outpatients, who after eight weeks of an appropriate dose of traditional therapy had not yet achieved remission. SUBJECTS: The adult participants (18-65 years) were outpatients with a primary diagnosis of GAD with or without comorbidities on the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Participants had a minimum of eight weeks standard treatment with an appropriate dose of a standard prescription anxiolytic, a clinician global impression-severity (CGI-S) score of 5-7, a Hamilton anxiety scale (HAM-A) total score >/=20 including a score of >2 on the anxious mood and tension items. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-one patients were enrolled in an open-label trial of the SKY course as an adjunct to standard treatment of GAD at the START Clinic for Mood and Anxiety Disorders, a tertiary care mood and anxiety disorder clinic in Toronto. The SKY course was administered over five days (22 h total). Subjects were encouraged to practice the yoga breathing techniques at home for 20 min per day after the course and were offered group practice sessions for 2 h once a week led by certified yoga instructors. The primary outcome measure was the mean change from pre-treatment on the HAM-A scale. Psychological measures were obtained at baseline and four weeks after completing the intervention. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients completed the program (mean age 42.6 +/- 13.3 years). Among completers, significant reductions occurred in the pre- and post-intervention mean HAM-A total score (t=4.59; P<0.01) and psychic subscale (t=5.00; P</=0.01). The response rate was 73% and the remission rate 41% as measured on the HAM-A. CONCLUSION: The results of this small pilot trial suggest that the SKY course represents a potentially valuable adjunct to standard pharmacotherapy in patients with GAD or treatment-resistant GAD, and warrants further investigation. In particular, changes in worry and body symptoms showed significant improvements that may further our understanding of the mechanism of change in the tolerance of anxiety and worry.

22346067	Yoga Nidra as a complementary treatment of anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with menstrual disorder.	BACKGROUND: Emotional insecurity, stress, depressive or/and anxiety symptoms are common with variable severity among patients with menstrual disorder. Yogic relaxation therapy (Yoga Nidra) leads to conscious and subconscious recognition of these underlying psychological factors and helps releasing of suppressed conflicts. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of Yoga Nidra on anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with menstrual disorders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects were recruited from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, C.S.M. Medical University (erstwhile KGMU), Lucknow Uttar Pradesh, India. The subjects were randomly divided in to two groups: Intervention group (with yogic intervention) and control group (without yogic intervention). Assessments of all subjects were carried out by administering Hamilton anxiety scale (HAM-A) and Hamilton rating scale for depression (HAM-D) at baseline and after six months. RESULTS: The mean age with S.D of the intervention group was 27.67 +/- 7.85 years, and for control group was 26.58 +/- 6.87 years (among completed intervention group nn = 65 and control group nn = 61). There was significant reduction of scores in HAM-A (P<0.003) and HAM-D (P<0.02) respectively in subjects with mild to moderate anxiety and depressive symptoms after six months of yoga therapy (Yoga Nidra) in intervention group in comparison to control group. CONCLUSION: The patients with mild to moderate anxiety and depressive symptoms improve significantly with 'Yoga Nidra' intervention. There is no significant improvement in the patients with severe anxiety and depressive symptoms.	Rani, Khushbu;Tiwari, Sc;Singh, Uma;Singh, Indrapal;Srivastava, Neena	2012 Jan
22346066	The effect of yoga in stress reduction for dental students performing their first periodontal surgery: A randomized controlled study.	CONTEXT: The dental students experience a lot of stress, which increase when they perform their first surgical procedure. Yoga as an anxiolytic tool in anxiety reduction has been practiced over centuries in India. AIM: To assess the efficacy of yoga in reducing the state trait anxiety of dental students before their first periodontal surgery performance. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A randomized controlled study using a two-way split plot design (pre-post-test) was conducted in the department of periodontics, Pacific Dental College, Udaipur, India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred clinical dental students who were ready to perform their first periodontal surgery were selected. Students were randomly assigned to two groups and were given a 60-min session on stress reduction. Group A, yogic intervention group, were instructed to do yoga and their performances were monitored for a period of one week and Group B, control group, were given a lecture on stress reduction without any yoga instructions. The investigator who was unaware of the groups had taken the state trait anxiety score of the students three times a) before assigning them to each group, b) prior to the surgical procedure and c) immediately after the performance of surgery. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Analyses of variance (ANOVA) by SPSS V.16. RESULTS: The statistical results showed a significant reduction in the VAS and state trait anxiety of Group A compared to Group B (ANOVA; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study concludes that Yogic breathing has a significant effect on the reduction of state trait anxiety level of dental students.

22346065	Development and feasibility of need-based yoga program for family caregivers of in-patients with schizophrenia in India.	CONTEXT AND AIM: Yoga has been found to be effective in the management of stress. This paper describes the development of a yoga program aimed to reduce burden and improve coping of family caregivers of inpatients with schizophrenia in India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on the assessment of caregiver needs, literature review, and expert opinion, a ten-day group yoga program was initially developed using the qualitative inductive method of inquiry. Each day's program included warm-up exercises, yogic asanas, pranayama, and satsang. A structured questionnaire eliciting comments on each day's contents was given independently to ten experienced yoga professionals working in the field of health for validation. The final version of the program was pilot-tested on a group of six caregivers of in-patients with schizophrenia admitted at NIMHANS, Bangalore. RESULTS: On the question of whether the program would help reduce the burden of caregivers, six of the ten experts (60%) gave a rank of four of five (very much useful). Based on comments of the experts, several changes were made to the program. In the pilot-testing stage, more than 60% of the caregivers assigned a score of four and above (on a five-point Likert scale, five being extremely useful) for the overall program, handouts distributed, and performance of the trainer. Qualitative feedback of the caregivers further endorsed the feasibility and usefulness of the program. CONCLUSION: The developed yoga program was found to be acceptable to caregivers of in-patients with schizophrenia.

22346064	Finger dexterity and visual discrimination following two yoga breathing practices.	BACKGROUND: Practicing yoga has been shown to improve motor functions and attention. Though attention is required for fine motor and discrimination tasks, the effect of yoga breathing techniques on fine motor skills and visual discrimination has not been assessed. AIM: To study the effect of yoga breathing techniques on finger dexterity and visual discrimination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study consisted of one hundred and forty subjects who had enrolled for stress management. They were randomly divided into two groups, one group practiced high frequency yoga breathing while the other group practiced breath awareness. High frequency yoga breathing (kapalabhati, breath rate 1.0 Hz) and breath awareness are two yoga practices which improve attention. The immediate effect of high frequency yoga breathing and breath awareness (i) were assessed on the performance on the O'Connor finger dexterity task and (ii) (in) a shape and size discrimination task. RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in the finger dexterity task by 19% after kapalabhati and 9% after breath awareness (P<0.001 in both cases, repeated measures ANOVA and post-hoc analyses). There was a significant reduction (P<0.001) in error (41% after kapalabhati and 21% after breath awareness) as well as time taken to complete the shape and size discrimination test (15% after kapalabhati and 15% after breath awareness; P<0.001) was also observed. CONCLUSION: Both kapalabahati and breath awareness can improve fine motor skills and visual discrimination, with a greater magnitude of change after kapalabhati.

22346063	Effect of integrated yoga therapy on pain, morning stiffness and anxiety in osteoarthritis of the knee joint: A randomized control study.	AIM: To study the effect of integrated yoga on pain, morning stiffness and anxiety in osteoarthritis of knees. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred and fifty participants with OA knees (35-80 years) were randomly assigned to yoga or control group. Both groups had transcutaneous electrical stimulation and ultrasound treatment followed by intervention (40 min) for two weeks with follow up for three months. The integrated yoga consisted of yogic loosening and strengthening practices, asanas, relaxation, pranayama and meditation. The control group had physiotherapy exercises. Assessments were done on 15(th) (post 1) and 90(th) day (post 2). RESULTS: Resting pain (numerical rating scale) reduced better (P<0.001, Mann-Whitney U test) in yoga group (post 1=33.6% and post 2=71.8%) than control group (post 1=13.4% and post 2=37.5%). Morning stiffness decreased more (P<0.001) in yoga (post 1=68.6% and post 2=98.1%) than control group (post 1=38.6% and post 2=71.6%). State anxiety (STAI-1) reduced (P<0.001) by 35.5% (post 1) and 58.4% (post 2) in the yoga group and 15.6% (post 1) and 38.8% (post 2) in the control group; trait anxiety (STAI 2) reduced (P<0.001) better (post 1=34.6% and post 2=57.10%) in yoga than control group (post 1=14.12% and post 2=34.73%). Systolic blood pressure reduced (P<0.001) better in yoga group (post 1=-7.93% and post 2=-15.7%) than the control group (post 1=-1.8% and post 2=-3.8%). Diastolic blood pressure reduced (P<0.001) better in yoga group (post 1=-7.6% and post 2=-16.4%) than the control group (post 1=-2.1% and post 2=-5.0%). Pulse rate reduced (P<0.001) better in yoga group (post 1=-8.41% and post 2=-12.4%) than the control group (post 1=-5.1% and post 2=-7.1%). CONCLUSION: Integrated approach of yoga therapy is better than physiotherapy exercises as an adjunct to transcutaneous electrical stimulation and ultrasound treatment in reducing pain, morning stiffness, state and trait anxiety, blood pressure and pulse rate in patients with OA knees.

22346062	Role of sudarshan kriya and pranayam on lipid profile and blood cell parameters during exam stress: A randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Yoga is a science practiced in India over thousands of years. It produces constituent physiological changes and has sound scientific basis. AIM: Since exam stress modifies lipid profile and hematological parameters, we conducted an investigation on the effect of sudarshan kriya (SK and P) program on these parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples of 43 engineering students were collected at four intervals namely baseline (BL), exam stress (ES), three and six weeks practice of SK and P during exam stress. Lipid profile and hematological parameters were measured at all four intervals. RESULTS: ES elevated total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGL) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels. Hematological parameters affected by ES included neutrophil, lymphocytes, platelet count, packed cell volume (PCV) and mean cell volume (MCV). Three and six weeks practice of SK and P reduced the elevated lipid profile, hematological parameters and improved lymphocyte levels. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that SK and P practice has the potential to overcome ES by improving lipid profile and hematological parameters.

22346061	Effect of yoga therapy in reversible inguinal hernia: A quasi experimental study.	BACKGROUND: Hernia is an abnormal protrusion of an organ or tissue through a defect in its surrounding walls which most commonly involves the abdominal wall, particularly the inguinal region. The treatment options for hernia ranges from simple exercises to modern surgeries. The effect of yoga therapy is not scientifically examined for reversible inguinal hernia and hence this study is undertaken with the aim to test the effect of selected asanas in reversible inguinal hernia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A quasi experimental trail of 19 males through consecutive sampling was done with selected asanas for three months and the outcome was measured by a questionnaire focusing on pain, aggravating factors, relieving factors and frequency of occurrence of symptoms of hernia. RESULTS: The pre and post interventional data were compared statistically and found significant reduction of symptoms with P</=0.001 in pain, frequency of occurrence and aggravating factors. The relieving factors showed significant increase with P</=0.001. CONCLUSION: Yoga therapy with selected asanas is effective in the treatment of reversible inguinal hernia.

22346060	Effect of yoga therapy on reaction time, biochemical parameters and wellness score of peri and post-menopausal diabetic patients.	BACKGROUND: Yogic practices may aid in the prevention and management of diabetes mellitus (DM) and reduce cardiovascular complications in the population. The present study has been undertaken to evaluate the effect of yoga therapy on reaction time, biochemical parameters and wellness score of peri and post-menopausal diabetic patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 15 peri and post-menopausal patients receiving standard medical treatment for type 2 DM were recruited and reaction time and biochemical investigations were done before and after a comprehensive yoga therapy program comprising of three times a week sessions for six weeks. A post-intervention, retrospective wellness questionnaire compiled by ACYTER was used to evaluate the comparative feelings of the patients after the therapy program. RESULTS: Yoga training reduced auditory reaction time (ART) from right as well as left hand, the decrease being statistically significant (P<0.05) for ART from the right hand. There was a significant (P<0.01) decrease in fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels as well as low density lipoprotein. The decrease in total cholesterol, triglycerides, and very low density lipoprotein and increase in high density lipoprotein was also statistically significant (P<0.05). All the lipid ratios showed desirable improvement with a decrease (P<0.01) of TC/HDL and LDL/HDL ratios and increase (P<0.05) in the HDL/LDL ratio. DISCUSSION OR CONCLUSION: Shortening of RT implies an improvement in the information processing and reflexes and is the first such report in diabetic patients. This has clinical significance and is worth further exploration with wider, well controlled, randomized studies in the diabetic population. Changes in blood glucose levels may be due to improved insulin sensitivity, decline in insulin resistance and increased sensitivity of the pancreatic b cells to glucose signals. Yoga improved the 'heart friendly' status of lipid profile in our subjects and as our participants were peri and post-menopausal, the decrease in cardiovascular risk profile is of greater significance. A comprehensive yoga therapy program has the potential to enhance the beneficial effects of standard medical management of diabetes mellitus and can be used as an effective complementary or integrative therapy program.

22346059	Predictors of adherence to an Iyengar yoga program in breast cancer survivors.	CONTEXT: Despite the known health benefits of physical activity, participation rates in cancer survivor groups remain low. Researchers have attempted to identify alternative modes of nontraditional physical activities that may increase participation and adherence rates. This study investigated the determinants of yoga in breast cancer survivors. AIM: To examine predictors of Iyengar yoga adherence in breast cancer survivors using the theory of planned behaviour. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Classes were held either in Campus Recreation facilities or at the Behavioral Medicine Fitness Center at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. The study was an evaluation of an existing yoga program. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-three post adjuvant therapy breast cancer survivors participating in a community-based, twice weekly, 12 week Iyengar yoga program were asked to complete baseline measures of the theory of planned behavior, demographic, medical, health/fitness, and psychosocial variables. Adherence was measured by objective attendance to the classes. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We analyzed univariate associations between predictors and yoga adherence with independent t-tests. RESULTS: Adherence to the Iyengar yoga program was 63.9% and was predicted by stronger intention (P<0.001), greater self-efficacy (P=0.003), more positive instrumental attitude (Ps=0.025), higher disease stage (P=0.018), yoga experience in the past year, (P=0.044), diagnosis of a second cancer (P=0.008), lower fatigue (P=0.037), and greater happiness (P=0.023). CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to Iyengar yoga in breast cancer survivors was strongly related to motivational variables from the theory of planned behaviour. Researchers attempting to improve yoga adherence in breast cancer survivors may benefit from targeting the key constructs in the theory of planned behaviour.

22344691	Contribution of the first K-homology domain of poly(C)-binding protein 1 to its affinity and specificity for C-rich oligonucleotides.	Poly-C-binding proteins are triple KH (hnRNP K homology) domain proteins with specificity for single stranded C-rich RNA and DNA. They play diverse roles in the regulation of protein expression at both transcriptional and translational levels. Here, we analyse the contributions of individual alphaCP1 KH domains to binding C-rich oligonucleotides using biophysical and structural methods. Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), we demonstrate that KH1 makes the most stable interactions with both RNA and DNA, KH3 binds with intermediate affinity and KH2 only interacts detectibly with DNA. The crystal structure of KH1 bound to a 5'-CCCTCCCT-3' DNA sequence shows a 2:1 protein:DNA stoichiometry and demonstrates a molecular arrangement of KH domains bound to immediately adjacent oligonucleotide target sites. SPR experiments, with a series of poly-C-sequences reveals that cytosine is preferred at all four positions in the oligonucleotide binding cleft and that a C-tetrad binds KH1 with 10 times higher affinity than a C-triplet. The basis for this high affinity interaction is finally detailed with the structure determination of a KH1.W.C54S mutant bound to 5'-ACCCCA-3' DNA sequence. Together, these data establish the lead role of KH1 in oligonucleotide binding by alphaCP1 and reveal the molecular basis of its specificity for a C-rich tetrad.

22343481	Benefits of yoga for psychosocial well-being in a US high school curriculum: a preliminary randomized controlled trial.	OBJECTIVE: To test feasibility of yoga within a high school curriculum and evaluate preventive efficacy for psychosocial well-being. METHODS: Grade 11 or 12 students (N = 51) who registered for physical education (PE) were cluster-randomized by class 2:1 yoga:PE-as-usual. A Kripalu-based yoga program of physical postures, breathing exercises, relaxation, and meditation was taught 2 to 3 times a week for 10 weeks. Self-report questionnaires were administered to students 1 week before and after. Primary outcome measures of psychosocial well-being were Profile of Mood States-Short Form and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children. Additional measures of psychosocial well-being included Perceived Stress Scale and Inventory of Positive Psychological Attitudes. Secondary measures of self-regulatory skills included Resilience Scale, State Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2, and Child Acceptance Mindfulness Measure. To assess feasibility, yoga students completed a program evaluation. Analyses of covariance were conducted between groups with baseline as the covariate. RESULTS: Although PE-as-usual students showed decreases in primary outcomes, yoga students maintained or improved. Total mood disturbance improved in yoga students and worsened in controls (p = .015), as did Profile of Mood States-Short Form (POMS-SF) Tension-Anxiety subscale (p = .002). Although positive affect remained unchanged in both, negative affect significantly worsened in controls while improving in yoga students (p = .006). Secondary outcomes were not significant. Students rated yoga fairly high, despite moderate attendance. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation was feasible and students generally found it beneficial. Although not causal due to small, uneven sample size, this preliminary study suggests preventive benefits in psychosocial well-being from Kripalu yoga during high school PE. These results are consistent with previously published studies of yoga in school settings.	Noggle, Jessica J;Steiner, Naomi J;Minami, Takuya;Khalsa, Sat Bir S	2012 Apr
22342535	Improvement in physiological and psychological parameters after 6 months of yoga practice.	Yoga is believed to have beneficial effects on cognition, attenuation of emotional intensity and stress reduction. Previous studies were mainly performed on eastern experienced practitioners or unhealthy subjects undergoing concomitant conventional therapies. Further investigation is needed on the effects of yoga per se, as well as its possible preventive benefits on healthy subjects. We investigated the effects of yoga on memory and psychophysiological parameters related to stress, comparing yoga practice and conventional physical exercises in healthy men (previously yoga-naive). Memory tests, salivary cortisol levels and stress, anxiety, and depression inventories were assessed before and after 6 months of practice. Yoga practitioners showed improvement of the memory performance, as well as improvements in psychophysiological parameters. The present results suggest that regular yoga practice can improve aspects of cognition and quality of life for healthy individuals. An indirect influence of emotional state on cognitive improvement promoted by yoga practice can be proposed.

22321865	123I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy for differentiating Parkinson's disease from other neurodegenerative parkinsonism: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVES: Differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and other neurodegenerative parkinsonism by clinical consensus criteria and diagnostic imaging is often difficult. (123)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy is a useful imaging tool for differentiating PD from other parkinsonism. The purpose of the present study is to systematically review and perform a meta-analysis of studies on the diagnostic performance of (123)I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy for the differential diagnosis of PD and other neurodegenerative parkinsonism, specifically multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. METHODS: A computer literature search of the PubMED/MEDLINE database was conducted to find relevant published articles on (123)I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy for the differential diagnosis of PD and other neurodegenerative parkinsonism. We used the bivariate random-effects model to obtain the pooled estimates of the sensitivity and specificity and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Thirteen studies comprising 845 patients including 625 PD and 220 other neurodegenerative parkinsonism were analyzed. The pooled sensitivity and specificity to differentiate PD from other neurodegenerative parkinsonism by the early heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) ratio were 82.6% and 89.2%, respectively, and those by the delayed H/M ratio were 89.7% and 82.6%, respectively. When PD was limited to early stage (Hoehn-Yahr stage 1 or 2), the pooled sensitivity and specificity by the delayed H/M ratio were 94.1% and 80.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis confirmed high sensitivity and specificity of (123)I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy for differentiating PD from other neurodegenerative parkinsonism in both early and delayed imaging phases. Furthermore, (123)I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy was highly effective for distinguishing early PD.	Orimo, Satoshi;Suzuki, Masahiko;Inaba, Akira;Mizusawa, Hidehiro	2012 Jun
22319901	The effects of Sudarshan Kriya Yoga on some physiological and biochemical parameters in mild hypertensive patients.	An open label intervention study was undertaken on 26 mild hypertensives and 26 apparently healthy adults (30-60 y), for the effect of Sudarshan Kriya Yoga practice for two months as complementary therapy. In the hypertensives, there was a significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure (P < 0.01), serum urea (P < 0.01) and plasma MDA (malondialdehyde adducts) as oxidative stress marker (P < 0.05). Other parameters; viz.; plasma levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, did not change significantly (P > 0.1). The pattern of change in most of the study parameters was such that values above normal range were lowered but values within normal range were unaltered. The action of Yoga on diastolic blood pressure, malondialdehyde adducts and kidney function in hypertensives was of counteractive nature and felt to be distinctly different than the effect of drugs.

22319847	Less equal than others? Experiences of AYUSH medical officers in primary health centres in Andhra Pradesh.	The National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) includes, inter alia, the establishment of an AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy) component (practitioner, trained assistants, drugs and equipment) in every primary health centre (PHC). However, five years following the launch of the NRHM, the AYUSH mainstreaming scenario is below expectations, riddled with ethical and governance issues. Accounts from AYUSH practitioners at PHCs in various regions of the state of Andhra Pradesh reveal enormous lacunae in implementation: unfilled positions, inequitable emoluments, inadequate or absent infrastructure, assistance and supplies, unethical interpersonal arrangements, and limited support from non-AYUSH personnel. The widespread negative impact of these conditions undermines the value of AYUSH, demotivating both practitioners and patients, and failing to provide the intended support to the public health system.

22309868	Use of complementary and alternative medicine for work-related pain correlates with career satisfaction among dental hygienists.	PURPOSE: Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMSP) is associated with work stress and burn-out among registered dental hygienists, with prevalence estimates ranging between 64 to 93%. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies can be helpful in managing CMSP. The purpose of this study was to determine if dental hygienists who use CAM have greater career satisfaction compared to conventional therapy (CT) users. METHODS: ADHA members (n=2,431) in North Carolina (n=573) and California (n=1,858) were surveyed. Data were analyzed using univariate and bivariate analyses and logistic regression. RESULTS: A response rate of 25.3% (n=617) was obtained, revealing that 76.5% (n=472) suffered from CMSP. The use of CAM or CT was reported among 80.7% (n=381) of dental hygienists with CMSP. CAM users reported greater overall health (79.3% vs. 54.0%, p<0.001), career satisfaction (59.2% vs. 39.0%, p<0.001) and were able to work the hours they wanted (69.8% vs. 64.0%, p<0.001) compared to CT users. Of those with CMSP, 36.4% (n=172) considered a career change and 13.0% (n=59) reported having left dental hygiene. Those with CMSP were less likely to recall that ergonomics were taught or reinforced during clinical training. CONCLUSION: CAM therapies may improve quality of life, reduce work disruptions and enhance career satisfaction for dental hygienists who suffer from CMSP. Ergonomics education may help reduce the number of hygienists who suffer from CMSP. Increased student awareness of CMSP risk is needed to reduce CMSP in the future by enhancing ergonomics education and incorporating CAM, such as yoga stretches, into the classroom and clinic routine.

22306535	Adiponectin, leptin, and yoga practice.	To address the mechanisms underlying hatha yoga's potential stress-reduction benefits, we compared adiponectin and leptin data from well-matched novice and expert yoga practitioners. These adipocytokines have counter-regulatory functions in inflammation; leptin plays a proinflammatory role, while adiponectin has anti-inflammatory properties. Fifty healthy women (mean age=41.32, range=30-65), 25 novices and 25 experts, provided fasting blood samples during three separate visits. Leptin was 36% higher among novices compared to experts, P=.008. Analysis of adiponectin revealed a borderline effect of yoga expertise, P=.08; experts' average adiponectin levels were 28% higher than novices across the three visits. In contrast, experts' average adiponectin to leptin ratio was nearly twice that of novices, P=.009. Frequency of self-reported yoga practice showed significant negative relationships with leptin; more weeks of yoga practice over the last year, more lifetime yoga sessions, and more years of yoga practice were all significantly associated with lower leptin, with similar findings for the adiponectin to leptin ratio. Novices and experts did not show even marginal differences on behavioral and physiological dimensions that might represent potential confounds, including BMI, central adiposity, cardiorespiratory fitness, and diet. Prospective studies addressing increased risk for type II diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease have highlighted the importance of these adipocytokines in modulating inflammation. Although these health risks are clearly related to more extreme values then we found in our healthy sample, our data raise the possibility that longer-term and/or more intensive yoga practice could have beneficial health consequences by altering leptin and adiponectin production.

Thus, it is used in the study of molecular pathophysiology of different neuropsychiatric disorders, such as, the major depressive disorder and has been an area of active research. We conducted a computer-based literature search using the Pubmed database with 'magnetic resonance spectroscopy', 'MRS', 'depression', and 'major depressive disorder' as the key words, supplemented by a manual search of bibliographic cross-referencing. Studies in depression report abnormalities in the frontal cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, and the occipital cortex. These abnormalities improve after treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, electroconvulsive therapy, and yoga, and thus, are possibly state-dependent. The findings are consistent with other morphometric and clinical studies and support the proposed pathophysiological theory of dysfunction in the neuronal circuits involving the frontal cortex, limbic cortex, and basal ganglia. Spectroscopy also has potential implications in predicting the response to treatment and formulating individualized pharmacotherapy.

22291847	Fifteen minutes of chair-based yoga postures or guided meditation performed in the office can elicit a relaxation response.	This study compared acute (15 min) yoga posture and guided meditation practice, performed seated in a typical office workspace, on physiological and psychological markers of stress. Twenty participants (39.6 +/- 9.5 yr) completed three conditions: yoga, meditation, and control (i.e., usual work) separated by >/=24 hrs. Yoga and meditation significantly reduced perceived stress versus control, and this effect was maintained postintervention. Yoga increased heart rate while meditation reduced heart rate versus control (P < 0.05). Respiration rate was reduced during yoga and meditation versus control (P < 0.05). Domains of heart rate variability (e.g., SDNN and Total Power) were significantly reduced during control versus yoga and meditation. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were reduced secondary to meditation versus control only (P < 0.05). Physiological adaptations generally regressed toward baseline postintervention. In conclusion, yoga postures or meditation performed in the office can acutely improve several physiological and psychological markers of stress. These effects may be at least partially mediated by reduced respiration rate.	Melville, Geoffrey W;Chang, Dennis;Colagiuri, Ben;Marshall, Paul W;Cheema, Birinder S	2012
27785173	The Effects of Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy on Quality of Life in Patients With Dementia.	BACKGROUND: To examine the effects of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) on quality of life (QOL) in patients with dementia. METHODS: We retrospectively included 53 Japanese community and tertiary hospitals to investigate the relationship between the newly developed PEG and consecutive dementia patients with swallowing difficulty between Jan 1st 2006 and Dec 31st 2008. We set improvements in 1) the level of independent living, 2) pneumonia, 3) peroral intake as outcome measures of QOL and explored the factors associated with these improvements. RESULTS: Till October 31st 2010, 1,353 patients with Alzheimer's dementia (33.1%), vascular dementia (61.7%), dementia with Lewy body disease (2.0%), Pick disease (0.6%) and others were followed-up for a median of 847 days (mean 805 +/- 542 days). A total of 509 deaths were observed (mortality 59%) in full-followed patients. After multivariate adjustments, improvement in the level of independent living was observed in milder dementia, or those who can live independently with someone, compared with advanced dementia, characterized by those who need care by someone: Odds Ratio (OR), 3.90, 95% confidence interval (95%CI), 1.59 - 9.39, P = 0.003. Similarly, improvement of peroral intake was noticed in milder dementia: OR, 2.69, 95%CI, 1.17 - 6.17, P = 0.02. Such significant associations were not observed in improvement of pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that improvement of QOL after PEG insertion may be expected more in milder dementia than in advanced dementia.

22286895	Mind-body interventions for treatment of phantom limb pain in persons with amputation.	Phantom limb pain (PLP) is a significant source of chronic pain in most persons with amputation at some time in their clinical course. Pharmacologic therapies for this condition are often only moderately effective and may produce unwanted adverse effects. There is growing empirical evidence of the therapeutic effectiveness of mind-body therapies for the relief of chronic pain; therefore, an exploration of their role in relieving amputation-related chronic pain is warranted. We undertook a focused literature review on mind-body interventions for patients with amputation who experience PLP. Because of study heterogeneity, only descriptive presentations of the studies are presented. Only studies of hypnosis, imagery, and biofeedback, including visual mirror feedback, were found; studies on meditation, yoga, and tai chi/qigong were missing from the literature. Few studies of specific mind-body therapies were dedicated to management of PLP, with the exception of mirror visual therapy. Overall, studies were largely exploratory and reflect considerable variability in the application of mind-body techniques, making definitive conclusions inadvisable. Nevertheless, the weight of existing findings indicates that a mind-body approach to PLP pain management is promising and that specific methods may offer either temporary or long-term relief, either alone or in combination with conventional therapies. The authors discuss the potential for usefulness of specific mind-body therapies and the relevance of their mechanisms of action to those of PLP, including targeting cortical reorganization, autonomic nervous system deregulation, stress management, coping ability, and quality-of-life. The authors recommend more and better quality research exploring the efficacy and mechanisms of action.

22286069	Optic disc measurements in full term infants.	BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to measure optic disc size in full term infants and to determine whether this value is influenced by sex or birth weight. METHODS: Retinal images from a cohort of full term infants admitted to a tertiary perinatal centre were obtained using a retinal camera. Optic disc size was measured by carefully delineating the outline with a cursor using image analysis software. MEDLINE was then systematically searched to compare the data with other published articles. RESULTS: 35 images of left and right eyes from 35 infants were assessed. An image from one eye per patient was then chosen for analysis. The following results were found: mean birth weight 3050+/-706 g; mean gestation 38.9+/-1.4 weeks. Mean optic disc area was 1.26+/-0.23 mm(2); mean vertical diameter was 1.37+/-0.15 mm; and mean horizontal diameter was 1.14+/-0.12 mm. The vertical diameter of the optic disc was significantly longer than the horizontal diameter (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Birth weight and sex did not influence the size of the optic disc in term infants. There were no differences in optic disc measurements between male and female infants and between low birth weight and normal birth weight infants.

22268128	A worksite vitality intervention to improve older workers' lifestyle and vitality-related outcomes: results of a randomised controlled trial.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a worksite vitality intervention on vigorous physical activity (VPA), fruit intake, aerobic capacity, mental health and need for recovery after work among older hospital workers (ie, 45 years and older). METHODS: The 6-month intervention was evaluated using a randomised controlled trial design. Workers who were randomised to the intervention group (n=367; control: n=363) received the Vital@Work intervention containing (1) a Vitality Exercise Program (VEP) combined with (2) three visits to Personal Vitality Coach. The VEP consisted of a weekly yoga session, a weekly workout session and weekly unsupervised aerobic exercising. Free fruit was provided at the VEP. Data on the outcome measures were collected (ie, year 2009-2010) at baseline (n=730) and 6 months of follow-up after baseline (n=575) using questionnaires, accelerometers and 2 km walk tests. Effects were analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle with complete cases (n=575) and imputed data (n=730) using linear regression analyses. Additional analyses were performed for high yoga and workout compliance (ie, >mean number of sessions). RESULTS: Effects were found for sports activities (beta=40.4 min/week, 95% CI 13.0 to 67.7) and fruit intake (beta=2.7 pieces/week, 95% CI 0.07 to 4.7) and were stronger for workers with high compliance to yoga (sport: beta=49.6 min/week, 95% CI 13.9 to 85.2; fruit: beta=3.8 pieces/week, 95% CI 1.1 to 6.4) and workout sessions (sport: beta=72.9 min/week, 95% CI 36.1 to 109.8; fruit: beta=4.0 pieces/week, 95% CI 1.1 to 6.4). The intervention group lowered their need for recovery, when compared to controls (beta=-3.5, 95% CI -6.4 to -0.54), with stronger effects for high workout compliance (beta=-5.3, 95% CI -9.3 to -1.3). No effects were found on VPA, aerobic capacity or mental health. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of worksite yoga and workout facilities and minimal fruit interventions should be considered by employers to promote transitions into healthier lifestyles and thereby health.

22266174	Reduced functional connectivity between cortical sources in five meditation traditions detected with lagged coherence using EEG tomography.	Brain functional states are established by functional connectivities between brain regions. In experienced meditators (13 Tibetan Buddhists, 15 QiGong, 14 Sahaja Yoga, 14 Ananda Marga Yoga, 15 Zen), 19-channel EEG was recorded before, during and after that meditation exercise which their respective tradition regards as route to the most desirable meditative state. The head surface EEG data were recomputed (sLORETA) into 19 cortical regional source model time series. All 171 functional connectivities between regions were computed as 'lagged coherence' for the eight EEG frequency bands (delta through gamma). This analysis removes ambiguities of localization, volume conduction-induced inflation of coherence, and reference-dependence. All significant differences (corrected for multiple testing) between meditation compared to no-task rest before and after meditation showed lower coherence during meditation, in all five traditions and eight (inhibitory as well as excitatory) frequency bands. Conventional coherence between the original head surface EEG time series very predominantly also showed reduced coherence during meditation. The topography of the functional connectivities was examined via PCA-based computation of principal connectivities. When going into and out of meditation, significantly different connectivities revealed clearly different topographies in the delta frequency band and minor differences in the beta-2 band. The globally reduced functional interdependence between brain regions in meditation suggests that interaction between the self process functions is minimized, and that constraints on the self process by other processes are minimized, thereby leading to the subjective experience of non-involvement, detachment and letting go, as well as of all-oneness and dissolution of ego borders during meditation.

22258395	The role of exercise and types of exercise in the rehabilitation of chronic pain: specific or nonspecific benefits.	Chronic pain is one of the most common complaints seen in general practitioners' offices, and it contributes to social, emotional, physical, and economical losses. The management of this problem poses challenges for health care providers when the current treatment of choice for chronic pain is pharmacological management, which may not be a sufficient and/or holistic approach to the management of chronic pain. Our goal is to increase awareness of the significance of physical activity, as well as examine additional cost-effective, integrated approaches to help manage the complex and debilitating effects of this condition. This article summarizes the types of exercise in the rehabilitation of chronic pain patients and provides practical recommendations for the clinician based on empirical and clinical experience. This safe, cost-free, nonpharmacologic way of managing pain has been found to reduce anxiety and depression, improve physical capacity, increase functioning and independence, and reduce morbidity and mortality.

22253507	Contribution of world health organization in the global acceptance of Ayurveda.	Amongst the mandates of United Nations, health of mankind is the thrust area of UN through World Health Organization (WHO). Planning and execution of policies for mainstreaming of traditional medicines (TRM) of respective countries along with conventional system of medicine (allopathy), first in the country of origin followed by the international arena, is the priority agenda of operations of WHO. Within Indian context, WHO accorded prime focus to Ayurveda in its activities related to TRM.Sponsorship and encouragement of studies substantiating parameters of standardization, safety and efficacy of herbal medicines of Ayurveda are under chief consideration of WHO. In this review, several guidelines of WHO are summarized. Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH), Central Council of Research in Ayurveda and Siddha and numerous other collaborative centers of WHO in India are assigned with several Appraisal Project Work (APW) and Direct Financial Cooperation (DFC) projects that will strengthen Ayurveda as evidence-based medicine for its global acceptance. Implementation of pharmacovigilance program in Ayurveda, publication of documents for rational use and initiatives to prepare consumer guidelines for appropriate use of Ayurvedic medicines are some other contributions of WHO toward advancement of Ayurveda at national as well as global level. Here, we suggest further exploration, interaction and interpretation of traditional knowledge in the light of contemporary core sciences and biomedical sciences that can pave the way for accreditation of Ayurveda worldwide as an established system of medicine.

22238664	Stretching of the back improves gait, mechanical sensitivity and connective tissue inflammation in a rodent model.	The role played by nonspecialized connective tissues in chronic non-specific low back pain is not well understood. In a recent ultrasound study, human subjects with chronic low back pain had altered connective tissue structure compared to human subjects without low back pain, suggesting the presence of inflammation and/or fibrosis in the low back pain subjects. Mechanical input in the form of static tissue stretch has been shown in vitro and in vivo to have anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. To better understand the pathophysiology of lumbar nonspecialized connective tissue as well as potential mechanisms underlying therapeutic effects of tissue stretch, we developed a carrageenan-induced inflammation model in the low back of a rodent. Induction of inflammation in the lumbar connective tissues resulted in altered gait, increased mechanical sensitivity of the tissues of the low back, and local macrophage infiltration. Mechanical input was then applied to this model as in vivo tissue stretch for 10 minutes twice a day for 12 days. In vivo tissue stretch mitigated the inflammation-induced changes leading to restored stride length and intrastep distance, decreased mechanical sensitivity of the back and reduced macrophage expression in the nonspecialized connective tissues of the low back. This study highlights the need for further investigation into the contribution of connective tissue to low back pain and the need for a better understanding of how interventions involving mechanical stretch could provide maximal therapeutic benefit. This tissue stretch research is relevant to body-based treatments such as yoga or massage, and to some stretch techniques used with physical therapy.

22232506	Patterns of yoga practice and physical activity following a yoga intervention for adults with or at risk for type 2 diabetes.	BACKGROUND: The current study described patterns of yoga practice and examined differences in physical activity over time between individuals with or at risk for type 2 diabetes who completed an 8-week yoga intervention compared with controls. METHODS: A longitudinal comparative design measured the effect of a yoga intervention on yoga practice and physical activity, using data at baseline and postintervention months 3, 6, and 15. RESULTS: Disparate patterns of yoga practice occurred between intervention and control participants over time, but the subjective definition of yoga practice limits interpretation. Multilevel model estimates indicated that treatment group did not have a significant influence in the rate of change in physical activity over the study period. While age and education were not significant individual predictors, the inclusion of these variables in the model did improve fit. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that an 8-week yoga intervention had little effect on physical activity over time. Further research is necessary to explore the influence of yoga on behavioral health outcomes among individuals with or at risk for type 2 diabetes.

22225932	A qualitative exploration of the impact of yoga on breast cancer survivors with aromatase inhibitor-associated arthralgias.	RESEARCH QUESTION: Arthralgia affects postmenopausal breast cancer survivors (BCS) receiving aromatase inhibitors (AI), which may result in reduced function and long-term well-being. This is an exploratory, qualitative investigation of BCS who participated in a yoga-based program to understand impact on joint pain and various aspects of quality of life (QOL) through a yoga program. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK: Social cognitive theory was used and provided the foundation for developing a yoga intervention through sources of efficacy information: (1) performance accomplishment, (2) structured experience, (3) verbal support from instructor and group, and (4) physical feedback. METHODOLOGY: Ten postmenopausal women with stage I-III breast cancer and AI associated arthralgia (AIAA) received yoga twice a week for eight weeks for 90 minutes and were instructed to continue in a home-based yoga program. We used social cognitive theory (SCT) to structure a yoga intervention as an ongoing physical activity to manage joint pain and function. Participants completed journal reflections on their experience and received weekly phone calls. ANALYSIS: Data was collected and analyzed using qualitative methods. Member checks were completed and emergent themes were explored and agreed upon by the research team to ensure reliability and validity of data. Several emergent themes were discovered: Empowerment: Importance of Camaraderie, Community, and Sharing; Pain Relief; Increased Physical Fitness (Energy, Flexibility, and Function); Relieved Stress/Anxiety and Transferability of Yoga through Breathing. These themes were identified through instructor observation, participant observation, and weekly phone call documentation. INTERPRETATION: Participants experienced an eight-week yoga intervention as an effective physical activity and support group that fostered various improvements in quality of life (QOL) and reduction in AIAA. Participants were highly motivated to improve physical fitness levels and reduce pain. This study revealed benefits from alternative forms of exercise such as yoga to provide a structure, which is transferable in other situations. Information, structured physical guidance in yoga postures, support, and feedback are necessary to foster physical activity for BCS experiencing pain. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Results of this qualitative analysis indicate that interventions to support BCS with AIAA are warranted. Yoga appears to positively impact these side effects of hormonal therapies. Additional research would aid in the development of other interventions.

22225929	Effect of pranayama (breathing exercise) on arrhythmias in the human heart.	BACKGROUND: Cardiac arrhythmias, especially ventricular tachyarrhythmias are an important public health problem. QT dispersion (QTd), defined as the difference between maximal and minimal QT intervals, reflects the regional inhomogeneity of ventricular repolarization dispersion and may mark the presence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. PURPOSE: To determine the effects of Pranayama (breathing exercise) on QTd in patients with arrhythmia. PATIENTS: Fifteen patients with arrhythmia and ejection fractions <40% (mean = 28 +/- 9%) who were on a stable medical regimen. DESIGN AND INTERVENTION: Standardized 12-lead surface ECGs were obtained at the beginning and end of the Pranayama session, and QT and JT intervals were measured manually and corrected for heart rate by using Bazett's formula. QTd, heart rate-corrected QTd (QTc-d), JT dispersion (JTd), and heart ratecorrected JTd (JTc-d) were measured in at least eight ECG leads in each patient. RESULTS: Following the Pranayama session, patients with arrhythmia had only slight improvements in exercise capacity (results were not significant). However, these patients had marked improvements in QTd (71 +/- 11 to 59 +/- 17 ms; P < .02), QTc-d (82 +/- 28 to 63 +/- 17 ms; P < .01), JTd (76 +/- 19 to 57 +/- 18 ms; P < .002), and JTc-d (84 +/- 23 to 61 +/- 18 ms; P < .001) following the Pranayama session. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that Pranayama significantly reduces the indices of ventricular repolarization dispersion in patients with arrhythmia. Further studies are needed to evaluate how effectively this reduction in ventricular repolarization dispersion decreases the risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death in patients with arrhythmia.

22219583	Alternative therapies useful in the management of diabetes: A systematic review.	Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder in the endocrine system. This dreadful disease is found in all parts of the world and becoming a serious threat of mankind health. There are lots of chemical agents available to control and to treat diabetic patients, but total recovery from diabetes has not been reported up to this date. In addition to adverse effects, drug treatments are not always satisfactory in maintaining euglycemia and avoiding late stage diabetic complications. Alternative to these synthetic agents, plants provided a potential source of hypoglycemic drugs and are widely used in several traditional systems of medicine to prevent diabetes. Several medicinal plants have been investigated for their beneficial effect in different type of diabetes. Other alternative therapies such as dietary supplements, acupuncture, hydrotherapy, and yoga therapies less likely to have the side effects of conventional approaches for diabetes.

22216749	Cost savings in inpatient oncology through an integrative medicine approach.	OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost impact of an integrative medicine intervention on an inpatient oncology service. STUDY DESIGN: This study used nonrandomized, nonequivalent groups. A baseline sample of inpatient oncology patients at Beth Israel Medical Center admitted to the medical oncology unit before implementation of the Urban Zen Initiative were compared with patients admitted after the Urban Zen Initiative was in place. METHODS: The Urban Zen Initiative incorporated yoga therapy, holistic nursing techniques, and a "healing environment" into routine inpatient oncology care. Length of stay and medication use data were extracted from Beth Israel's decision support electronic database. We compared length of stay, total medication costs, and costs of as-needed medications for both groups: the baseline sample of inpatient oncology patients and patients exposed to the Urban Zen healing environment initiative. RESULTS: We had complete cost data on 85 patients in our baseline group and 72 in our intervention group. We found no difference in length of stay between the 2 groups. We found a significant decrease in use of antiemetic, anxiolytic, and hypnotic medication costs as well as a decrease in total medication costs in the Urban Zen sample compared with the baseline group. CONCLUSIONS: An integrative medicine approach including yoga therapy, holistic nursing, and a healing environment in the inpatient setting can decrease use of medications, resulting in substantial cost savings for hospitals in the care of oncology patients.

22216054	A comparative randomised controlled trial of the effects of brain wave vibration training, iyengar yoga, and mindfulness on mood, well-being, and salivary cortisol.	This randomised trial compared the effects of Brain Wave Vibration (BWV) training, which involves rhythmic yoga-like meditative exercises, with Iyengar yoga and Mindfulness. Iyengar provided a contrast for the physical components and mindfulness for the "mental" components of BWV. 35 healthy adults completed 10 75-minute classes of BWV, Iyengar, or Mindfulness over five weeks. Participants were assessed at pre- and postintervention for mood, sleep, mindfulness, absorption, health, memory, and salivary cortisol. Better overall mood and vitality followed both BWV and Iyengar training, while the BWV group alone had improved depression and sleep latency. Mindfulness produced a comparatively greater increase in absorption. All interventions improved stress and mindfulness, while no changes occurred in health, memory, or salivary cortisol. In conclusion, increased well-being followed training in all three practices, increased absorption was specific to Mindfulness, while BWV was unique in its benefits to depression and sleep latency, warranting further research.

22211151	Fascia Research from a Clinician/Scientist's Perspective.	The upcoming Third International Fascia Research Congress will have much exciting information for the clinician, as well as for the clinical and basic science researcher. This paper provides a perspective from a clinician/scientist, including the fascial network of body-wide connections between and within individual cells, and sharing of loads between muscle and fascia. Basic studies of fibroblast cell shape show the impact of manual therapy, acupuncture, and yoga-like stretching at the cellular level. Advances in scientific equipment have made it possible to study a layer of hyaluronan fluid, which allows sliding between deep fascia and muscle. Collagen fibers within fascia affect both blood flow to muscles and lymphatic fluid flow.	Findley, Thomas W	2011
27182380	Ground Reaction Forces Generated by Twenty-eight Hatha Yoga Postures.	Adherents claim many benefits from the practice of yoga, including promotion of bone health and prevention of osteoporosis. However, no known studies have investigated whether yoga enhances bone mineral density. Furthermore, none have estimated reaction forces applied by yoga practitioners. The purpose of this study was to collect ground reaction force (GRF) data on a variety of hatha yoga postures that would commonly be practiced in fitness centers or private studios. Twelve female and eight male volunteers performed a sequence of 28 hatha yoga postures while GRF data were collected with an AMTI strain-gauge force platform. The sequence was repeated six times by each study subject. Four dependent variables were studied: peak vertical GRF, mean vertical GRF, peak resultant GRF, and mean resultant GRF. Univariate analysis was used to identify mean values and standard deviations for the dependent variables. Peak vertical and resultant values of each posture were similar for all subjects, and standard deviations were small. Similarly, mean vertical and resultant values were similar for all subjects. This 28 posture yoga sequence produced low impact GRF applied to upper and lower extremities. Further research is warranted to determine whether these forces are sufficient to promote osteogenesis or maintain current bone health in yoga practitioners.

27182377	Physiological and Perceptual Responses to Nintendo(R) Wii Fit in Young and Older Adults.	Physically active video gaming (AVG) provides a technologically-modern, convenient means of increasing physical activity (PA). This study examined cardiovascular, metabolic, and perceptual responses in young adult (AP) and older adult (OP) participants engaging in Wii Fit(TM) AVG play, and compared PA levels during play to recommended PA levels. Heart rate (HR), percent heart rate reserve (%HRR), oxygen consumption (VO2), energy expenditure (EE), rating of perceived exertion (RPE), enjoyment level (EL), and step count data were obtained from 10 YP and 10 OP during 15 minutes of rest and four 15-minute bouts of Wii Fit(TM) activities (yoga, balance, aerobics, strength). For all participants, AVG significantly increased HR, VO2, and EE measures above rest, with significant between-activity differences. Responses were similar between YP and OP, except that the activities were more intense for OP, in terms of %HRR and RPE. Most games elicited responses consistent with light-intensity PA, though peak HR and VO2 values for aerobic and strength games met or approached recommended PA intensities. Wii Fit(TM) appears to provide an enjoyable form of light PA for both YP and OP, which can reduce inactive screen time and provide beneficial cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and metabolic stimulation.

24198591	Is yoga a suitable treatment for rheumatoid arthritis: current opinion.	We reviewed published literature regarding the use of yoga for managing rheumatoid arthritis to determine whether adequate evidence exists to suggest its usefulness as a therapy. A search for previous studies involving yoga and rheumatoid arthritis in PubMed yielded eight reports. These studies reported the benefits of yoga in the physical and mental health of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), suggesting that yoga is a useful add-on therapy for RA patients. However, all studies showed limitations with respect to sample size, study design, description and duration of yoga intervention, and assessment tools and statistical methods used. Additionally, the studies did not attempt to understand the mechanisms underlying observed benefits. Hence, evidence suggests a definite role of yoga in RA improvement, reducing pain, improving function, and creating a positive mental state. However, detailed analysis and additional studies are necessary to verify these observations.	Telles, Shirley;Singh, Nilkamal	2012 Aug 8
24196801	Development and validation of a need-based integrated yoga program for cancer patients: a retrospective study.	CONTEXT AND AIM: Complementary and alternative therapies (CAM) are gaining popularity amongst patients as add on to conventional medicine. Yoga stands third amongst all CAM that is being used by cancer patients today. Different schools of yoga use different sets of practices, with some using a more physical approach and many using meditation and/or breathing. All these modules are developed based on the needs of the patient. This paper is an attempt to provide the basis for a comprehensive need based integrative yoga module for cancer patients at different stages of treatment and follow up. In this paper, the holistic modules of the integrated approach of yoga therapy for cancer (IAYTC) have been developed based on the patient needs, as per the observations by the clinicians and the caregivers. Authors have attempted to systematically create holistic modules of IAYTC for various stages of the disease and treatment. These modules have been used in randomized trials to evaluate its efficacy and have shown to be effective as add-on to conventional management of cancer. Thus, the objective of this effort was to present the theoretical basis and validate the need based holistic yoga modules for cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Literature from traditional texts including Vedas, Ayurveda, Upanishads, Bhagavat Gita, Yoga Vasishtha etc. and their commentaries were looked into for references of cancer and therapeutic directives. Present day scientific literature was also explored with regards to defining cancer, its etiopathology and its management. Results of studies done using CAM therapies were also looked at, for salient findings. Focused group discussions (FGD) amongst researchers, experienced gurus, and medical professionals involved in research and clinical cancer practice were carried out with the objectives of determining needs of the patient and yoga practices that could prove efficient. A list of needs at different stages of conventional therapies (surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy) was listed and yoga modules were developed accordingly. Considering the needs, expected side effects, the energy levels and the psychological states of the participants, eight modules evolved. RESULTS: The results of the six steps for developing the validated module are reported. Step 1: Literature review from traditional yoga and ayurveda texts on etiopathogenesis and management of cancer (arbuda), and the recent literature on cancer stem cells and immunology of cancer. Step 2: Focused group discussions and deliberations to compile the needs of patients based on the expected side effects, energy levels and the psychological state of the patient as observed by the caregivers and the clinicians. Step 3: Content validation through consensus by the experts for the eight modules of IAYTC that could be used as complimentary to conventional management of cancer at different stages during and after the diagnosis was created. Step 4: Field testing for safety and feasibility of the modules through pilot studies. Step 5: Compilation of the results of efficacy trials through RCTs and step 6: A review of our studies on mechanisms to offer evidence for action of IAYTC on psycho-neuro-immunological pathways in cancer. CONCLUSION: The evidence from the traditional knowledge and recent scientific studies validates eight modules of integrated approach of yoga therapy for cancer that can be used safely and effectively as complimentary during all conventional cancer therapies.

24196800	Enhancement of cancer stem cell susceptibility to conventional treatments through complementary yoga therapy: possible cellular and molecular mechanisms.	Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are stem-like tumor populations that are reported to contribute towards tumor growth, maintenance and recurrence after therapy. Hypoxia increases CSC fraction and promotes acquisition of a stem-cell-like state. Cancer stem cells are critically dependant on the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) for survival, self-renewal, tumor growth and maintenance of their undifferentiated phenotype. Recent researches show that stage of differentiation of the tumor cells is predictive of their susceptibility to natural killer cell (NK) cell mediated cytotoxicity and cancer stem cells are significant targets of NK cell cytotoxicity. Studies also show that reversion of tumor cells to a less-differentiated phenotype can be achieved by blocking NFkappaB. Yoga therapy (yogic lifestyle modifications encompassing physical postures, breathing practices, relaxation techniques and meditations) is known to modulate neural, endocrine and immune functions at the cellular level through influencing cell cycle control, aging, oxidative stress, apoptosis and several pathways of stress signaling molecules. Yoga therapy has also been shown to enhance natural killer cell activity and modulate stress and DNA damage in breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. Recent study found that brief daily yogic meditation may reverse the pattern of increased NFkappaB-related transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines in leukocytes. Thus, yoga therapy has the potential to reduce cancer stem cell survival, self -renewal and tumor growth by modifying the tumor micro-environment through various mechanisms such as; 1) reducing HIF-1 activity by enhanced oxygenation, 2) promoting NK cell activity directly (or indirectly through down regulating NFkappaB expression), thereby enhancing NK cell mediated CSC lysis, and 3) by minimizing the aberrant expressions or activities of various hormones, cytokines, chemokines and tumor signaling pathways. Yoga therapy may have a synergistic effect with conventional modalities of treatment in preventing cancer progression and recurrences.

24149206	Effects of an 8-month yoga intervention on arterial compliance and muscle strength in premenopausal women.	Previous studies have indicated that Yoga exercise has a positive effect on reducing blood pressure and heart rate. However, no randomized controlled studies to date have investigated its effects on arterial compliance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of an 8-month Yoga intervention on arterial compliance and muscle strength in normal premenopausal women 35-50 years of age. Thirty-four women were randomly assigned either to a Yoga exercise group (YE, n = 16) or a control group (CON, n = 18). Participants in YE group performed 60 minutes of an Ashtanga Yoga series 2 times/week with one day between sessions for 8 months. Each Yoga session consisted of 15 minutes of warm-up exercises, 35 minutes of Ashtanga Yoga postures and 10 minutes of cool-down with relaxation; and the session intensity was progressively increased during the 8 months. Participants in CON were encouraged to maintain their normal daily lifestyles monitored by the bone-specific physical activity questionnaire at 2 month intervals for 8 months. Arterial compliance (pulse contour analysis) and muscle strength (1 Repetition Maximum) were assessed at baseline and after the intervention. Arterial compliance of the large and small arteries was not affected by the 8 month Yoga training (p > 0.05). Also, there were no significant (p > 0.05) group, time, or group x time interaction effects for cardiovascular variables. YE group significantly (p < 0.01) improved leg press muscle strength compared to CON (11.4% vs. -6.5%). Eight months of Ashtanga Yoga training was beneficial for improving leg press strength, but not arterial compliance in premenopausal women. Key pointsThe 8 month Yoga training did not affect arterial compliance of the large and small arteries.None of the cardiovascular variables were changed by the Yoga intervention.Isotonic muscle strength was not altered by the Yoga intervention, with the exception of leg press.

24082325	The effects of pranayama, hatha and raja yoga on physical pain and the quality of life of women with multiple sclerosis.	In a clinical trial carried out on 60 women with multiple sclerosis, the researchers obtained data using survey questionnaires. In addition to demographic data, the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQoL-54) instrument was used to determine how multiple sclerosis influences the quality of life of the studied women. Within the frame of this randomized controlled trial, the participants were divided into two equally sized groups (the case and the control group) in which the level of pain and the quality of life were evaluated. The case group exercised pain-managing Yoga methods for three months, keeping the pace of eight 90-minute sessions per month. The control participants were subjected to no intervention. One month after the Yoga therapy, the level of pain and the quality of life were evaluated in both groups and compared to the baseline data. Data were analyzed using SPSS software and paired t-tests. After the Yoga therapy, the case group showed a significant improvement in physical pain management (P=0.007) and the quality of life (P=0.001) as compared to the control group. The results showed that Yoga techniques can alleviate physical pain and improve the quality of life of multiple sclerosis patients.

23667857	Exercise Recommendations for Cancer-Related Fatigue, Cognitive Impairment, Sleep problems, Depression, Pain, Anxiety, and Physical Dysfunction: A Review.	Cancer and its treatments produce a myriad of burdensome side effects and significantly impair quality of life (QOL). Exercise reduces side effects and improves QOL for cancer patients during treatment and recovery. Exercise prior to, during, and after completion of cancer treatments provides numerous beneficial outcomes. Exercise represents an effective therapeutic intervention for preparing patients to successfully complete treatments, for reducing acute, chronic and late side effects, and for improving QOL during and after treatments. This overview of exercise oncology and side-effect management summarizes existing evidence-based exercise guidelines for cancer patients and survivors.

23619381	Evidence for extended age dependent maternal immunity in infected children: mother to child transmission of HIV infection and potential interventions including sulfatides of the human fetal adnexa and complementary or alternative medicines.	The two neighboring southwestern states of India, Karnataka and Maharashtra, have high incidence of HIV/AIDS and are among the six most high prevalence HIV infected states. In Karnataka state, the northern districts of Bagalkot, Belgaum and Bijapur (the three Bs) and in Maharashtra state, the southern districts of Sangli, Satara, and Solapur (the three Ss) are the areas with the highest incidence of HIV/AIDS. We have evaluated the incidence of maternal to child transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1 infection in Belgaum District which is more than 500 kilometers distance by road from the campus in greater Bangalore (Karnataka State). We have obtained the prenatal CD4 counts of HIV infected pregnant mothers. We have also screened the HIV infected children in two orphanages (rehabilitation centres for HIV infected children) in Belgaum District. The clinical conditions of these infected children were assessed for their CD4 counts, anti-retroviral therapy (ART) intake status, outpatient illnesses and body composition. We have observed that there is an influence of the age factor on the CD4 counts of the HIV infected children. Further, in view of the role of our recently found involvement of sulfatide, 3-O- galactosylceramide, in inhibition of HIV-1 replication and enhancement of hematopoiesis which is otherwise inhibited due to such infection, we have discussed the possible role of sulfatides that biologically occur in the fetal adnexa (placentatrophoblasts /amnion/chorion-umbilical cord), in containing HIV infection as a potential safer alternative to the ART regimens currently approved to be clinically practiced. Lastly, we have discussed the complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies such as evidence based yoga and ayurveda as add-on to ART in potential elimination of MTCT of HIV infection. Out of a total of 150 children delivered by HIV infected mothers, 13 children were found to be positive as determined by the dried blood smear (DBS) for virological testing, giving an incidence of about 8.66% in the Belgaum district during the last two years, in spite of the prescription of currently available ART regimens. All the 13 HIV-transmitting mothers had normal vaginal deliveries. Though 12% of the total 150 deliveries required lower segment caesarean section (LSCS), none among them resulted in MTCT of HIV. Comparison of the prenatal CD4 counts between transmitting and non-transmitting mothers did not show significant differences (p=0.25) thus suggesting indirectly that HIV-1 proviral loads (undetermined / unavailable) need not necessarily determine the fate of incidence of vertical transmission. The mean age of 44 HIV infected children (14 females, 30 males) that were screened in two orphanages was 10.8+/-3.1 years. Out of these 44 children, 27 were taking ART (61.36%) with mean duration of consumption being 2.8+/-2.28 years. Fifty percent (n=22) of the children were suffering from at least one outpatient illness, out of which 13 were taking ART. Their mean basal metabolic rate (BMR), body mass index (BMI), muscle mass, fat mass and fat % were 795.45+/-106.9, 14.55+/-1.9 kg/m(2), 9.54+/-3.4 kg, 3.69+/-2.24 kg and 15.04+/-7.8% respectively. Comparison between the children taking ART (on-ART, n=27) and those not taking ART (non-ART, n= 17) showed that though there was no significant difference in the average age of the two groups, on-ART children had significantly higher BMR (p=0.05), and muscle mass (p=0.004), than non-ART. The CD4 counts, BMI, fat mass and fat percentage did not show significant statistical differences between the two groups. The CD4 counts of the children (both on-ART and non-ART) of age 8 years and below (n=12) were found to be significantly higher (p=0.04) than those of age 14 and above (n=10). All the children in age group of 14 years and above (n=10) except one child were on ART, whereas 7 out of 12 children in age group of 8 years and below were on-ART. In one of the rehabilitation centers called Aadhar, among non-ART children, a significant correlation was observed between the age of the child and CD4 counts (measured separately in the months of June 2011 and December 2011). Both the CD4 counts measured in June 2011 (n=6; r=-0.82, p= 0.04) as well as in December 2011 (n=6; r=-0.97, p=0.001) showed a significant decline as the age progressed. Also, at the same center, among on-ART children, the CD4 counts in June 2011 (n=7) and December 2011 (n=8) were significantly different between the children in the age group of 8 below years, and those in the age group of 14 years and above (p= 0.005). As HIV infected children grow in age, they may lose maternal derived immunity as shown by the decrease in CD4 counts, irrespective of their ART status. It is to be expected from these results that the conferred maternal immunity (possibly primarily humoral and secondarily cytotoxic immune responses) to the virus acquired at child birth taper off and eventually overcome by the generation of mutant HIV strains in the children, as the life spans of the infected children progress. We have discussed safer therapeutic interventions whose efficacy on HIV/AIDS may be synergistic to or even substitute the existing treatment strategies. Some of such interventions may even be customized to help eliminate MTCT. Further, these virus infected pregnant mother patient blood / serum samples could prove useful in the vaccine development against HIV infection.

22203808	Yoga lessons for consciousness research: a paralimbic network balancing brain resource allocation.	Consciousness has been proposed to play a key role in shaping flexible learning and as such is thought to confer an evolutionary advantage. Attention and awareness are the perhaps most important underlying processes, yet their precise relationship is presently unclear. Both of these processes must, however, serve the evolutionary imperatives of survival and procreation. They are thus intimately bound by reward and emotion to help to prioritize efficient brain resource allocation in order to predict and optimize behavior. Here we show how this process is served by a paralimbic network consisting primarily of regions located on the midline of the human brain. Using many different techniques, experiments have demonstrated that this network is effective and specific for self-awareness and contributes to the sense of unity of consciousness by acting as a common neural path for a wide variety of conscious experiences. Interestingly, hemodynamic activity in the network decreases with focusing on external stimuli, which has led to the idea of a default mode network. This network is one of many networks that wax and vane as resources are allocated to accommodate the different cyclical needs of the organism primarily related to the fundamental pleasures afforded by evolution: food, sex, and conspecifics. Here we hypothesize, however, that the paralimbic network serves a crucial role in balancing and regulating brain resource allocation, and discuss how it can be thought of as a link between current theories of so-called "default mode," "resting state networks," and "global workspace." We show how major developmental disorders of self-awareness and self-control can arise from problems in the paralimbic network as demonstrated here by the example of Asperger syndrome. We conclude that attention, awareness, and emotion are integrated by a paralimbic network that helps to efficiently allocate brain resources to optimize behavior and help survival.

22199103	Study of sense of coherence health promoting behavior in north Indian students.	BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: With advances in knowledge about health promotion, public health professionals are in search for the determinants of personal health behaviours. This study was carried out to explore the level of engagement of north Indian students in health promoting behaviours; to determine their sense of coherence scores; and to ascertain the determinants of health promoting behaviours of these students. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was done in four randomly selected colleges of Chandigarh during 2007-2008 in 200 students (100 male, 100 female). Their health promoting lifestyle profile (HPLP) and sense of coherence (SOC) scores were estimated using interviews. The data were analyzed using Pearson's product moment correlation, and also stepwise linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Mean HPLP and SOC scores of the students were 138.69 and 130.87, respectively. Females cared more about their health than males. Male students were more involved in physical activities. There was a linear correlation between the total SOC and HPLP scores (r=0.3). Female students (63%) consulted doctors more than males (50%) and washed their hands more regularly (P<0.05). Only 13 per cent students practiced yoga regularly. Female students had more meaningful relationships with friends and had more faith in God. Regression equation revealed that the two independent variables (SOC and age) accounted for 10.8 per cent of the variance in HPLP. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Students with higher SOC scores had higher HPLP scores. Female students were more health conscious than male students. In general, college students in Chandigarh had a good health promoting lifestyle and good sense of coherence.	Suraj, Senjam;Singh, Amarjeet	2011 Nov
22197582	How diverse was the leisure time physical activity of older Australians over the past decade?	OBJECTIVES: Public health recommendations for older adults highlight the need to engage in a combination of aerobic, muscle strength, flexibility and balance activities. This study characterised leisure time physical activity in older Australians (>/= 65 years), examining the diversity in reported activities DESIGN: Cross-sectional monitoring. METHODS: The Exercise Recreation and Sport Surveys (2001-2009) were combined and analysed for 22,050 elderly. RESULTS: Walking was reported by 45.6%, of those 53% engaged exclusively in walking. Prevalent sports (i.e., >1%) were bowls (9.4%), aerobics/callisthenics exercise (9.1%), golf (7.7%), swimming (6.4%), gym work (5.2%), cycling (3.2%), tennis (2.9%), dancing (2.1%), fishing (2.0%), tai chi (1.4%), weight lifting (1.2%) and yoga (1.1%). Significant gender differences were apparent. Over time, significant increases were reported in walking, aerobic/callisthenics and gym workout in both genders. In the previous year, 32.0% of older adults participated in "nil" activity, 40.6% engaged in one activity, 19.5% and 8.0% participated in two or three or more activities, respectively. Common combinations were walking with another aerobic activity. Only 2.6% reported a combination of aerobic, balance and strength activities. Multiple-activity participation increased over the years, but declined with increasing age, education and for the most disadvantaged, compared to single-activity participation. Partially or exclusively organised participation, combined, was reported by 42.5% of older adults. Women were more likely to combine mode of participation. Geographic region was associated with multiple-activity participation and organised-only participation. CONCLUSIONS: Most elderly people engage in one activity, if at all. An increase in participation in balance enhancing activities and weight training is warranted to maximize health benefits.	Dafna, Merom;Carmen, Cosgrove;Kamalesh, Venugopal;Adrian, Bauman	2012 May
22196575	Exercise research on children and adolescents.	This paper is a review of studies published during the last several years on exercise effects on overweight, growth, chronic illnesses, depression and anxiety in children and adolescents. Although the lion's share of the research involves aerobic exercise, studies on yoga and tai chi are also reviewed. Following exercise, body mass index and lipid profiles have improved in overweight children, and those with asthma, diabetes and depression have also benefited from exercise. The yoga studies reviewed here focused on ADHD and anxiety, and the tai chi studies involved children with ADHD and asthma. A potential underlying mechanism for the positive effects of exercise, yoga and tai chi may be the stimulation of pressure receptors leading to increased vagal activity, decreased stress hormones and increased production of anti-pain and antidepressant neurotransmitters such as serotonin. Further studies are needed using convergent behavioral, physiological and biochemical measures. Nonetheless, the current literature highlights the importance of adding exercise programs to clinics, schools and families for the physical and psychological well-being of children and adolescents.

22180393	Yoga for persistent fatigue in breast cancer survivors: a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Cancer-related fatigue afflicts up to 33% of breast cancer survivors, yet there are no empirically validated treatments for this symptom. METHODS: The authors conducted a 2-group randomized controlled trial to determine the feasibility and efficacy of an Iyengar yoga intervention for breast cancer survivors with persistent post-treatment fatigue. Participants were breast cancer survivors who had completed cancer treatments (other than endocrine therapy) at least 6 months before enrollment, reported significant cancer-related fatigue, and had no other medical conditions that would account for fatigue symptoms or interfere with yoga practice. Block randomization was used to assign participants to a 12-week, Iyengar-based yoga intervention or to 12 weeks of health education (control). The primary outcome was change in fatigue measured at baseline, immediately post-treatment, and 3 months after treatment completion. Additional outcomes included changes in vigor, depressive symptoms, sleep, perceived stress, and physical performance. Intent-to-treat analyses were conducted with all randomized participants using linear mixed models. RESULTS: Thirty-one women were randomly assigned to yoga (n = 16) or health education (n = 15). Fatigue severity declined significantly from baseline to post-treatment and over a 3-month follow-up in the yoga group relative to controls (P = .032). In addition, the yoga group had significant increases in vigor relative to controls (P = .011). Both groups had positive changes in depressive symptoms and perceived stress (P < .05). No significant changes in sleep or physical performance were observed. CONCLUSIONS: A targeted yoga intervention led to significant improvements in fatigue and vigor among breast cancer survivors with persistent fatigue symptoms.

22179916	[Bulimia and anorexia among the teenagers].	BACKGROUND: The disturbances related to the feeding behavior are increasing in Tunisia. AIM: To evaluate the impact of an adapted and personalized therapeutic program, including dietetic advises and practice of yoga in Tunisian teenagers suffering from bulimia or anorexia. METHODS: Our study was carried out on 31 teenagers, old 16 to 19 years, 10 were anorexics (9 girls and 1 boy) and 21 were bulimics (14 girls and 7 boys). RESULTS: After twelve weeks of program application a clear improvement of the physical and mental state of our subjects was recorded. Indeed, an average fall of 7.3% of the body weight of the compulsive eaters and an increase of 6.6% of that of the anorexics were obtained. On the mental level, the frequency of the subjects which make daily crises passed from 29% to 19%. More half of the subjects (54.8%) paid more not to vomit but occasionally (less than one once out of two crises). CONCLUSIONS: These results show that an assumption of responsibility targeted of the teenagers suffering from food behavioral problems can help them to be left there.

22178433	Effects of yoga interventions on pain and pain-associated disability: a meta-analysis.	UNLABELLED: We searched databases for controlled clinical studies, and performed a meta-analysis on the effectiveness of yoga interventions on pain and associated disability. Five randomized studies reported single-blinding and had a higher methodological quality; 7 studies were randomized but not blinded and had moderate quality; and 4 nonrandomized studies had low quality. In 6 studies, yoga was used to treat patients with back pain; in 2 studies to treat rheumatoid arthritis; in 2 studies to treat patients with headache/migraine; and 6 studies enrolled individuals for other indications. All studies reported positive effects in favor of the yoga interventions. With respect to pain, a random effect meta-analysis estimated the overall treatment effect at SMD = -.74 (CI: -.97; -.52, P < .0001), and an overall treatment effect at SMD = -.79 (CI: -1.02; -.56, P < .0001) for pain-related disability. Despite some limitations, there is evidence that yoga may be useful for several pain-associated disorders. Moreover, there are hints that even short-term interventions might be effective. Nevertheless, large-scale further studies have to identify which patients may benefit from the respective interventions. PERSPECTIVE: This meta-analysis suggests that yoga is a useful supplementary approach with moderate effect sizes on pain and associated disability.

22164809	Is there more to yoga than exercise?	CONTEXT: Yoga is increasing in popularity, with an estimated 15 million practitioners in the United States, yet there is a dearth of empirical data addressing the holistic benefits of yoga. OBJECTIVE: To compare the physical and mental benefits of an exercise-based yoga practice to that of a more comprehensive yoga practice (one with an ethical/spiritual component). DESIGN: Students with mild to moderate depression, anxiety, or stress and who agreed to participate were assigned to one of three groups: integrated yoga, yoga as exercise, control. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 81 undergraduate students 18 years and older at a university in the southeastern United States participated in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression, anxiety, stress, hope, and salivary cortisol. RESULTS: Over time, participants in both the integrated and exercise yoga groups experienced decreased depression and stress, an increased sense of hopefulness, and increased flexibility compared to the control group. However, only the integrated yoga group experienced decreased anxiety-related symptoms and decreased salivary cortisol from the beginning to the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga, practiced in a more integrated form, ie, with an ethical and spiritual component, may provide additional benefits over yoga practiced as an exercise regimen.

22161453	Relaxation techniques for pain management in labour.	BACKGROUND: Many women would like to avoid pharmacological or invasive methods of pain management in labour and this may contribute towards the popularity of complementary methods of pain management. This review examined currently available evidence supporting the use of relaxation therapies for pain management in labour. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of relaxation methods for pain management in labour on maternal and perinatal morbidity. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 November 2010), The Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field's Trials Register (November 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to 30 November 2010), CINAHL (1980 to 30 November 2010), the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (30 November 2010), Chinese Clinical Trial Register (30 November 2010), Current Controlled Trials (30 November 2010), ClinicalTrials.gov, (30 November 2010) ISRCTN Register (30 November 2010), National Centre for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) (30 November 2010) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (30 November 2010). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing relaxation methods with standard care, no treatment, other non-pharmacological forms of pain management in labour or placebo. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. Two review authors independently assessed trial quality. We attempted to contact study authors for additional information. MAIN RESULTS: We included 11 studies (1374 women) in the review. Relaxation was associated with a reduction in pain intensity during the latent phase (mean difference (MD) -1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.97 to -0.53, one trial, 40 women) and active phase of labour (MD -2.48, 95% CI -3.13 to 0.83, two trials, 74 women). There was evidence of improved outcomes from relaxation instruction with increased satisfaction with pain relief (risk ratio (RR) 8.00, 95% CI 1.10 to 58.19, one trial, 40 women) and lower assisted vaginal delivery (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.50, two trials, 86 women). Yoga was associated with reduced pain (mean difference (MD) -6.12, 95% CI -11.77 to -0.47), one trial, 66 women), increased satisfaction with pain relief (MD 7.88, 95% CI 1.51 to 14.25, one trial, 66 women), satisfaction with the childbirth experience (MD) 6.34, 95% CI 0.26 to 12.42, one trial, 66 women), and reduced length of labour when compared to usual care (MD -139.91, 95% CI -252.50 to -27.32, one trial, 66 women) and when compared with supine position (MD -191.34, 95% CI -243.72 to -138.96, one trial, 83 women). Trials evaluating music and audio analgesia found no difference between groups in the primary outcomes pain intensity, satisfaction with pain relief, and caesarean delivery. The risk of bias was unclear for the majority of trials. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Relaxation and yoga may have a role with reducing pain, increasing satisfaction with pain relief and reducing the rate of assisted vaginal delivery. There was insufficient evidence for the role of music and audio-analgesia. However, there is a need for further research.

22153143	Reducing stress in school-age girls through mindful yoga.	INTRODUCTION: School-age children report much stress in their daily lives, which may lead to psychological and physical problems. Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction is a program of awareness-based practices effective with adults. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of mindfulness training through yoga with school-age girls to reduce perceived stress, enhance coping abilities, self-esteem, and self-regulation, and explore the relationship between the dose of the intervention and outcomes. METHOD: Fourth- and fifth-grade girls were recruited from two public schools and randomly assigned to intervention and wait-list control groups. The intervention group met 1 hour a week for 8 weeks and completed 10 minutes of daily homework. RESULTS: Self-esteem and self-regulation increased in both groups. The intervention group was more likely to report greater appraisal of stress (p < .01) and greater frequency of coping (p < .05). Homework accounted for 7% of the variance in reported stress. DISCUSSION: Consistent with reports of mindfulness training, greater awareness of the feelings associated with stress may enhance coping abilities. However, it is possible that the increasing awareness of stressors in itself increased stress, possibly as part of the process of developing mindfulness or related to cognitive, emotional, or social development. Mindfulness in children may differ from mindfulness in adults and warrants further investigation.	White, Laura Santangelo	2012 Jan-Feb
22150014	Retinal microvascular changes in low-birth-weight babies have a link to future health.	BACKGROUND: In utero insults that result in low-birth-weight (LBW) infants are now recognized risk factors for the development of vascular-related diseases in adulthood. Microcirculatory pathologies are believed to form a mechanistic link between fetal insult and the manifestation of illness in adulthood. OBJECTIVES: The challenge has been to investigate microcirculatory changes in vivo. The objective of this review is to determine whether LBW infants and individuals undergo abnormal microvascular changes and, if so, whether these changes can be objectively identified and measured by investigating retinal vessels. METHODS: An online publication search was carried out using the following keywords to identify and review relevant articles: retinal microvasculature, retinal vessels, small for gestation age, growth restriction, and intrauterine growth restriction. Articles published from 1980 to 2011 were considered. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of retinal imaging technology to assess and measure retinal microvasculature makes it a valuable assessment tool. The current tool is, however, unsuitable for non-invasive assessment in infants and young children. Once this hurdle has been overcome, a longitudinal study of LBW individuals from infancy to adulthood, with regular retinal microvascular assessments, would help prove the mechanistic link between LBW and cardiovascular disease in adulthood.

22149237	Long-term concentrative meditation and cognitive performance among older adults.	BACKGROUND: The general consensus that cognitive abilities decline with advancing age is supported by several studies that have reported that older adults perform more poorly on multiple tests of cognitive performance as compared to younger adults. To date, preventive measures against this cognitive decline have been mainly focused on dietary, physical, and lifestyle behaviors which could allow older adults to maintain their cognitive abilities into late life. However, much less stress has been laid on evaluating meditation as a preventive measure in such cases in spite of the fact that the role of meditation on attention has been proved in several studies. In the current study, we extend this preliminary idea, examining the practice of concentrative meditation and the differences in the cognitive performance of older adults who have or have not employed this practice long term. METHODOLOGY: This was a cross-sectional study comparing the cognitive performance of meditators and non-meditators in the geriatric age group. Twenty (age > 55 years) long-term practitioners of Vihangam Yoga meditation (>10 years of practice) were recruited in the present study and were applied six paper-pencil neuropsychological tests for assessment of short-term memory, perceptual speed, attention, and executive functioning. The tests used were: (1) the Digit Span test, (2) the Stroop Color Word test, (3) the Trailmaking test, (4) the Letter Cancellation Task, (5) the digit symbol substitution test, and (6) the Rule Shift Card Test. All the tests were also applied to 20 age- and education-matched geriatric adults who have not practiced the meditation technique. RESULTS: Vihangam Yogis showed significantly better performances in all these tests of attention (p < .05) except for the digit backward test, where a trend (p = .08) was found in favor of meditators. CONCLUSION: Long-term Vihangam Yoga meditators have superior cognitive abilities than non-meditators in the old age group. This technique should be studied further for its ability to prevent age-related cognitive decline.

22135480	Effect of yogic bellows on cardiovascular autonomic reactivity.	CONTEXT: Yoga is an ancient science, which originated in India. Pranayama has been assigned a very important role in yogic system of exercises. It is known that regular practice of breathing exercises (pranayama) increases parasympathetic tone, decreases sympathetic activity, and improves cardiovascular functions. Different types of breathing exercises alter autonomic balance for good by either decrease in sympathetic or increase in parasympathetic activity. Mukh Bhastrika (yogic bellows), a type of pranayama breathing when practiced alone, has demonstrated increase in sympathetic activity and load on heart, but when practiced along with other types of pranayama has showed improved cardiac performance. AIM: The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of long term practice of fast pranayama (Mukh Bhastrika) on autonomic balance on individuals with stable cardiac function. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This interventional study was conducted in the department of physiology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 50 healthy male subjects of 18 - 25 years age group, fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria underwent Mukh Bhastrika training for 12 weeks. Cardiovascular autonomic reactivity tests were performed before and after the training. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The parameters were analyzed by Student t test. RESULTS: This study showed an increase in parasympathetic activity i.e., reduced basal heart rate, increase in valsalva ratio and deep breathing difference in heart rate; and reduction in sympathetic activity i.e., reduction in fall of systolic blood pressure on posture variation. CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that Mukh Bhastrika has beneficial effect on cardiac autonomic reactivity, if practiced for a longer duration.

22132353	Effectiveness of yoga therapy as a complementary treatment for major psychiatric disorders: a meta-analysis.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of yoga therapy as a complementary treatment for psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). DATA SOURCES: Eligible trials were identified by a literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Control Trials Register, Google Scholar, and EBSCO on the basis of criteria of acceptable quality and relevance. The search was performed using the following terms: yoga for schizophrenia, yoga for depression, yoga for anxiety, yoga for PTSD, yoga therapy, yoga for psychiatric disorders, complementary treatment, and efficacy of yoga therapy. Trials both unpublished and published with no limitation placed on year of publication were included; however, the oldest article included in the final meta-analysis was published in 2000. STUDY SELECTION: All available randomized, controlled trials of yoga for the treatment of mental illness were reviewed, and 10 studies were eligible for inclusion. As very few randomized, controlled studies have examined yoga for mental illness, this meta-analysis includes studies with participants who were diagnosed with mental illness, as well as studies with participants who were not diagnosed with mental illness but reported symptoms of mental illness. Trials were excluded due to the following: (1) insufficient information, (2) inadequate statistical analysis, (3) yoga was not the central component of the intervention, (4) subjects were not diagnosed with or did not report experiencing symptoms of one of the psychiatric disorders of interest (ie, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and PTSD), (5) study was not reported in English, and (6) study did not include a control group. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted on participant diagnosis, inclusion criteria, treatment and control groups, duration of intervention, and results (pre-post mean and standard deviations, t values, and f values). Number, age, and sex ratio of participants were also obtained when available. DATA SYNTHESIS: The combined analysis of all 10 studies provided a pooled effect size of -3.25 (95% CI, -5.36 to -1.14; P = .002), indicating that yoga-based interventions have a statistically significant effect as an adjunct treatment for major psychiatric disorders. Findings in support of alternative and complementary interventions may especially be an aid in the treatment of disorders for which current treatments are found to be inadequate or to carry severe liabilities. CONCLUSIONS: As current psychopharmacologic interventions for severe mental illness are associated with increased risk of weight gain as well as other metabolic side effects that increase patients' risk for cardiovascular disease, yoga may be an effective, far less toxic adjunct treatment option for severe mental illness.

22121462	Effect of short-term pranayama and meditation on cardiovascular functions in healthy individuals.	CONTEXT: Asana, pranayama, and meditation are three main techniques of yoga practiced in India over thousands of years to attain functional harmony between the body and mind. Recent studies on long-term yogic practices have shown improvements in cardiovascular functions. AIM: The present study was conducted to ascertain if a short-term practice of pranayama and meditation had improvements in cardiovascular functions in healthy individuals with respect to age, gender, and body mass index (BMI). SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This interventional study was conducted in the Department of physiology of S.N. Medical College, Bagalkot. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty healthy subjects (24 males and 26 females) of 20-60 years age group, fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria underwent two hours daily yoga program for 15 days taught by a certified yoga teacher. Pre and post yoga cardiovascular functions were assessed by recording pulse rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean blood pressure. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The parameters were analyzed by Student's t test. RESULTS: There was significant reduction in resting pulse rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial blood pressure after practicing pranayama and meditation for 15 days. The response was similar in both the genders, both the age groups, <40 yrs and >40 yrs and both the groups with BMI, <25 kg/m(2) and >25 kg/m(2). CONCLUSION: This study showed beneficial effects of short term (15 days) regular pranayama and meditation practice on cardiovascular functions irrespective of age, gender, and BMI in normal healthy individuals.

22106845	Impact of relaxation training according to Yoga In Daily Life(R) system on self-esteem after breast cancer surgery.	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this pilot study was to gather information on the immediate and short-term effects of relaxation training according to the Yoga In Daily Life((R)) system on the self-esteem of patients with breast cancer. DESIGN: This is a parallel-groups design. SETTINGS/LOCATION: Baseline interventions took place at the Institute for Oncology of Ljubljana (Slovenia). At discharge, the experimental group was issued with audiocassette recordings containing the instructions for relaxation training to be practiced individually at home for an additional 3 weeks. SUBJECTS: The convenience sample of 32 patients with breast cancer was recruited from an accessible population of hospitalized women. Patients were randomized to the experimental (n=16) and to the control group (n=16). INTERVENTIONS: Both groups received the same standard physiotherapy for 1 week, while the experimental group additionally received a group relaxation training sessions according to the Yoga in Daily Life((R)) system. At discharge, the experimental group was issued with audiocassette recordings containing similar instructions for relaxation training to be practiced individually at home for an additional 3 weeks. OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were obtained by blinded investigators (physiotherapists) using standardized questionnaires (Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale) at baseline (after the surgery); at 1 week (1 week postattendance; at discharge); and at 4 weeks (4 weeks postattendance); prior the commencement of radiation. RESULTS: Analysis of variance showed that there were statistically significant differences between the experimental and control group in all measuring self-esteem scores over the study period (p<0.0005). At the same time, the control group's scores remained unchanged over the study period (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that relaxation training according to the Yoga in Daily Life system could be a useful clinical physiotherapy intervention for patients who have breast cancer and who are experiencing low self-esteem. Although this kind of relaxation training can be applied to clinical oncology in Slovenia, more studies need to be done.	Kovacic, Tine;Kovacic, Miha	2011 Dec

22102042	Mutation and crystallization of the first KH domain of human polycytosine-binding protein 1 (PCBP1) in complex with DNA.	Polycytosine-binding proteins (PCBPs) are triple KH-domain proteins that play an important role in the regulation of translation of eukaryotic mRNA. They are also utilized by viral RNA and have been shown to interact with ssDNA. Underlying their function is the specific recognition of C-rich nucleotides by their KH domains. However, the structural basis of this recognition is only partially understood. Here, the preparation of a His-tagged KH domain is described, representing the first domain of PCBP1 that incorporates a C54S mutation as well as the addition of a C-terminal tryptophan. This construct has facilitated the preparation of highly diffracting crystals in complex with C-rich DNA (sequence ACCCCA). Crystals of the KH1-DNA complex were grown using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method in 0.1 M phosphate-citrate pH 4.2, 40%(v/v) PEG 300. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 1.77 A resolution and the diffraction was consistent with space group P2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 38.59, b = 111.88, c = 43.42 A, alpha = gamma = 90.0, beta = 93.37 degrees . The structure of the KH1-DNA complex will further our insight into the basis of cytosine specificity by PCBPs.	Yoga, Yano M K;Traore, Daouda A K;Wilce, Jacqueline A;Wilce, Matthew C J	2011 Oct 1
22094915	Oligonephropathy of prematurity.	With improved health care, the number of premature babies who survive to adulthood is expected to increase. The objective of this review is to determine whether premature infants have an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). A literature review was performed by searching PubMed (U.S. National Library of Medicine) and the Cochrane Library, using the keywords "prematurity," "kidney," "nephrogenesis," "oligonephropathy," and "kidney impairment." Articles published in English since 1990 were reviewed. Increasing evidence suggests that prematurity causes oligonephropathy independently of, and coexisting with, intrauterine growth restriction. Animal studies show that nephrogenesis continues for up to 3 weeks in extrauterine life, but with up to 18% abnormal glomeruli. Nephrogenesis is further impaired in preterm infants who develop renal impairment in the early postnatal period, which is estimated to be 8 to 24%. Premature infants are at risk for CKD. A larger longitudinal study is needed that follows up premature infants to determine the exact incidence of CKD. Until then, renal assessment in premature infants should be incorporated into follow-up guidelines, in addition to the current assessment of growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes. The cost implications to a comprehensive program, impact of early identification, and strategies to improve outcomes in this population are needed.

22090672	Non-pharmacological Interventions in Hypertension: A Community-based Cross-over Randomized Controlled Trial.	BACKGROUND: Hypertension is the most prevalent non-communicable disease causing significant morbidity/mortality through cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal complications. OBJECTIVES: This community-based study tested the efficacy of non-pharmacological interventions in preventing/controlling hypertension. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cross-over randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the earlier RCT (2007) of non-pharmacological interventions in hypertension, conducted in the urban service area of our Institute. The subjects, prehypertensive and hypertensive young adults (98 subjects: 25, 23, 25, 25 in four groups) were randomly allotted into a group that he/she had not belonged to in the earlier RCT: Control (New Group I), Physical Exercise (NG II)-brisk walking for 50 to 60 minutes, three to four days/week, Salt Intake Reduction (NG III) to at least half of their previous intake, Yoga (NG IV) for 30 to 45 minutes/day, five days/week. Blood pressure was measured before and after eight weeks of intervention. Analysis was by ANOVA with a Games-Howell post hoc test. RESULTS: Ninety-four participants (25, 23, 21, 25) completed the study. All three intervention groups showed significant reduction in BP (SBP/DBP mmHg: 5.3/6.0 in NG II, 2.5/2.0 in NG III, and 2.3/2.4 in NG IV, respectively), while the Control Group showed no significant difference. Persistence of significant reduction in BP in the three intervention groups after cross-over confirmed the biological plausibility of these non-pharmacological interventions. This study reconfirmed that physical exercise was more effective than Salt Reduction or Yoga. Salt Reduction, and Yoga were equally effective. CONCLUSION: Physical exercise, salt intake reduction, and yoga are effective non-pharmacological methods for reducing blood pressure in young pre-hypertensive and hypertensive adults.

22090079	Feasibility study: the effect of therapeutic yoga on quality of life in children hospitalized with cancer.	PURPOSE: To describe the effect of therapeutic yoga on child and parental reports of quality of life in children hospitalized with oncological diagnoses. METHODS: Six children participated in 5 yoga sessions over 2 months. The PedsQL 4.0 was administered to each child and participating parent/caregivers at baseline and after completion of the yoga intervention. The Wilcoxon nonparametric rank test measured individual differences over time. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences (P < .05) were found in child perception of gross motor function. CONCLUSION: These feasibility study data suggest that therapeutic yoga positively affected child perception of gross motor function measured on the PedsQL 4.0. Further studies are needed, including a randomized control trial and with a larger number of participants, to clarify and confirm the effect of therapeutic yoga.

22089179	Effects of yoga exercise on serum adiponectin and metabolic syndrome factors in obese postmenopausal women.	OBJECTIVE: Regular and continuous yoga exercise is one of the most important nonpharmacological methods of improving serum lipid concentrations, adipose tissue, and metabolic syndrome factors. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of yoga exercise on serum adiponectin and metabolic syndrome factors in obese postmenopausal Korean women. METHODS: Sixteen healthy postmenopausal women aged 54.50 +/- 2.75 years with more than 36% body fat were randomly assigned to either a yoga exercise group (n = 8) or to a "no exercise" control group (n = 8). The variables of body composition, visceral fat, serum adiponectin, and metabolic syndrome factors were measured in all the participants before and after the 16-week study. RESULTS: Body weight, percentage of body fat, lean body mass, body mass index, waist circumference, and visceral fat area had significantly decreased. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and adiponectin had significantly increased, but total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, insulin, glucose, and homoeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance had significantly decreased. Serum adiponectin concentrations were significantly correlated with waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, diastolic blood pressure, and homoeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance in the postyoga exercise group. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that yoga exercise improves adiponectin level, serum lipids, and metabolic syndrome risk factors in obese postmenopausal women. Consequently, yoga exercise will be effective in preventing cardiovascular disease caused by obesity in obese postmenopausal Korean women.	Lee, Jeong-Ah;Kim, Jong-Won;Kim, Do-Yeon	2012 Mar
22082165	Systematic review of the effectiveness of breathing retraining in asthma management.	In asthma management, complementary and alternative medicine is enjoying a growing popularity worldwide. This review synthesizes the literature on complementary and alternative medicine techniques that utilize breathing retraining as their primary component and compares evidence from controlled trials with before-and-after trials. Medline, PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and the Cochrane Library electronic databases were searched. Reference lists of all publications were manually checked to identify studies not found through electronic searching. The selection criteria were met by 41 articles. Most randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the Buteyko breathing technique demonstrated a significant decrease in beta(2)-agonist use while several found improvement in quality of life or decrease in inhaled corticosteroid use. Although few in number, RCTs of respiratory muscle training found a significant reduction in bronchodilator medication use. Where meta-analyses could be done, they provided evidence of benefit from yoga, Buteyko breathing technique and physiotherapist-led breathing training in improving asthma-related quality of life. However, considerable heterogeneity was noted in some RCTs of yoga. It is reasonable for clinicians to offer qualified support to patients with asthma undertaking these breathing retraining techniques.

22071817	Exercise for improving balance in older people.	BACKGROUND: In older adults, diminished balance is associated with reduced physical functioning and an increased risk of falling. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2007. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of exercise interventions on balance in older people, aged 60 and over, living in the community or in institutional care. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 1), MEDLINE and EMBASE (to February 2011). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled studies testing the effects of exercise interventions on balance in older people. The primary outcomes of the review were clinical measures of balance. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Pairs of review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data from studies. Data were pooled where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: This update included 94 studies (62 new) with 9,917 participants. Most participants were women living in their own home.Most trials were judged at unclear risk of selection bias, generally reflecting inadequate reporting of the randomisation methods, but at high risk of performance bias relating to lack of participant blinding, which is largely unavoidable for these trials. Most studies only reported outcome up to the end of the exercise programme.There were eight categories of exercise programmes. These are listed below together with primary measures of balance for which there was some evidence of a statistically significant effect at the end of the exercise programme. Some trials tested more than one type of exercise. Crucially, the evidence for each outcome was generally from only a few of the trials for each exercise category. 1. Gait, balance, co-ordination and functional tasks (19 studies of which 10 provided primary outcome data): Timed Up & Go test (mean difference (MD) -0.82 s; 95% CI -1.56 to -0.08 s, 114 participants, 4 studies); walking speed (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.43; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.75, 156 participants, 4 studies), and the Berg Balance Scale (MD 3.48 points; 95% CI 2.01 to 4.95 points, 145 participants, 4 studies).2. Strengthening exercise (including resistance or power training) (21 studies of which 11 provided primary outcome data): Timed Up & Go Test (MD -4.30 s; 95% CI -7.60 to -1.00 s, 71 participants, 3 studies); standing on one leg for as long as possible with eyes closed (MD 1.64 s; 95% CI 0.97 to 2.31 s, 120 participants, 3 studies); and walking speed (SMD 0.25; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.46, 375 participants, 8 studies).3. 3D (3 dimensional) exercise (including Tai Chi, qi gong, dance, yoga) (15 studies of which seven provided primary outcome data): Timed Up & Go Test (MD -1.30 s; 95% CI -2.40 to -0.20 s, 44 participants, 1 study); standing on one leg for as long as possible with eyes open (MD 9.60 s; 95% CI 6.64 to 12.56 s, 47 participants, 1 study), and with eyes closed (MD 2.21 s; 95% CI 0.69 to 3.73 s, 48 participants, 1 study); and the Berg Balance Scale (MD 1.06 points; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.76 points, 150 participants, 2 studies).4. General physical activity (walking) (seven studies of which five provided primary outcome data). 5. General physical activity (cycling) (one study which provided data for walking speed). 6. Computerised balance training using visual feedback (two studies, neither of which provided primary outcome data). 7. Vibration platform used as intervention (three studies of which one provided primary outcome data).8. Multiple exercise types (combinations of the above) (43 studies of which 29 provided data for one or more primary outcomes): Timed Up & Go Test (MD -1.63 s; 95% CI -2.28 to -0.98 s, 635 participants, 12 studies); standing on one leg for as long as possible with eyes open (MD 5.03 s; 95% CI 1.19 to 8.87 s, 545 participants, 9 studies), and with eyes closed ((MD 1.60 s; 95% CI -0.01 to 3.20 s, 176 participants, 2 studies); walking speed (SMD 0.04; 95% CI -0.10 to 0.17, 818 participants, 15 studies); and the Berg Balance Scale ((MD 1.84 points; 95% CI 0.71 to 2.97 points, 80 participants, 2 studies).Few adverse events were reported but most studies did not monitor or report adverse events.In general, the more effective programmes ran three times a week for three months and involved dynamic exercise in standing. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is weak evidence that some types of exercise (gait, balance, co-ordination and functional tasks; strengthening exercise; 3D exercise and multiple exercise types) are moderately effective, immediately post intervention, in improving clinical balance outcomes in older people. Such interventions are probably safe. There is either no or insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions for general physical activity (walking or cycling) and exercise involving computerised balance programmes or vibration plates. Further high methodological quality research using core outcome measures and adequate surveillance is required.	Howe, Tracey E;Rochester, Lynn;Neil, Fiona;Skelton, Dawn A;Ballinger, Claire	2011 Nov 9
22052946	Systematic review of the benefits of physical therapy within a multidisciplinary care approach for people with schizophrenia.	BACKGROUND: Although schizophrenia is the fifth leading cause of disability-adjusted life years worldwide in people aged 15 to 44 years, the clinical evidence of physical therapy as a complementary treatment remains largely unknown. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to systematically review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness of physical therapy for people with schizophrenia. DATA SOURCES: EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), and the Cochrane Library were searched from their inception until July 1, 2011, for relevant RCTs. In addition, manual search strategies were used. STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers independently determined study eligibility on the basis of inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: Reviewers rated study quality and extracted information about study methods, design, intervention, and results. DATA SYNTHESIS: Ten RCTs met all selection criteria; 6 of these studies addressed the use of aerobic and strength exercises. In 2 of these studies, yoga techniques also were investigated. Four studies addressed the use of progressive muscle relaxation. There is evidence that aerobic and strength exercises and yoga reduce psychiatric symptoms, state anxiety, and psychological distress and improve health-related quality of life, that aerobic exercise improves short-term memory, and that progressive muscle relaxation reduces state anxiety and psychological distress. LIMITATIONS: The heterogeneity of the interventions and the small sample sizes of the included studies limit overall conclusions and highlight the need for further research. CONCLUSIONS: Physical therapy offers added value in the multidisciplinary care of people with schizophrenia.

22048551	A critical review of concept of aging in Ayurveda.	Ayurveda has a holistic approach toward all the miseries of man and aging is one of these. It is classified as one of the natural and Yapya (palliative) diseases. It is the process of becoming old and decaying. As age advances, several changes take place in the body, in the external appearance, in the condition of Dosha, Dhatu, Mala, Agni, Oja, and so on, as well as in the mental and cognitive functions. Elderly people are susceptible to several chronic diseases also. The problems of the elderly are becoming a matter of great concern as increased life expectancy due to better medical services and improved technology is resulting in an increasing population of the aged. By the year 2020, the World will have more than one billion people aged 60 and over, and more than two-thirds of them will be living in the developing countries. A major concern related to the rapid increase in the population of the aged is that there will be an increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases and disabilities, both being conditions that tend to accompany the aging process. This burden is increasing day by day. In the Ayurvedic texts, a comprehensive description has been given of aging. The aim of this conceptual article is to compile and re-evaluate the various principles related to different aspects of aging.	Devi, Durgawati;Srivastava, Rajeev;Dwivedi, B K	2010 Oct
22048540	Clinical evaluation of the efficacy of Khadiradi yoga avachoornana in Kachchu with special reference to genitoinguinal intertrigo.	Kachchu is a simple localized dermatological infection of the genitoinguinal region, which occurs because of unhygienic observance, and manifests in the form of inflammation followed by secondary bacterial or fungal infections that can be best correlated to genitoinguinal intertrigo. Even though it rarely causes systemic manifestations, its mere presence itself is disturbing because of intractable itching and pain. It may delay the proper healing of the episiotomy wound and may cause difficulty in walking because of severe pain. Candida powder is the highest selling medicine for the intertrigo, as the incidence of intertrigo is as high as 40% in some particular seasons. In the Ayurveda fraternity, there is no established preparation that can be preserved safely in all the epochs of life in females and which is easy to apply. After understanding the disease in the perspective of the ayurvedic and modern medicinal systems, Khadiradi yoga choorna - a new ayurvedic formulation - was prepared on the basis of stringent ayurvedic principles. Hence, an attempt has been made to study the efficacy of the khadiradi yoga avachurnana(1) in Kachchu, with special reference to genitoinguinal intertrigo in females.

22048261	Yoga decreases insomnia in postmenopausal women: a randomized clinical trial.	OBJECTIVE: The practice of yoga has been proven to have positive effects on reducing insomnia. Studies have also shown its effects on reducing climacteric symptoms. To date, however, no studies that evaluate the effects of yoga on postmenopausal women with a diagnosis of insomnia in a randomized clinical trial have been conducted. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of yoga practice on the physical and mental health and climacteric symptoms of postmenopausal women with a diagnosis of insomnia. METHODS: Postmenopausal women not undergoing hormone therapy, who were 50 to 65 years old, who had an apnea-hypopnea index less than 15, and who had a diagnosis of insomnia were randomly assigned to one of three groups, as follows: control, passive stretching, and yoga. Questionnaires were administered before and 4 months after the intervention to evaluate quality of life, anxiety and depression symptoms, climacteric symptoms, insomnia severity, daytime sleepiness, and stress. The volunteers also underwent polysomnography. The study lasted 4 months. RESULTS: There were 44 volunteers at the end of the study. When compared with the control group, the yoga group had significantly lower posttreatment scores for climacteric symptoms and insomnia severity and higher scores for quality of life and resistance phase of stress. The reduction in insomnia severity in the yoga group was significantly higher than that in the control and passive-stretching groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that a specific sequence of yoga might be effective in reducing insomnia and menopausal symptoms as well as improving quality of life in postmenopausal women with insomnia.

22046516	Complementary and alternative exercises for management of osteoarthritis.	Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic condition characterized by degeneration of cartilage and its underlying bone within a joint. With no cure currently available, the goals of treating OA are to alleviate pain, maintain, or improve joint mobility, increase the muscle strength of the joints, and minimize the disabling effects of the disease. Recent research has suggested that complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) exercises may improve OA symptoms. This paper covers CAM mind-body exercises-Tai Chi, qigong, and yoga-for OA management and evaluates their benefits in pain reduction, muscle strength, physical function, stiffness, balance, fear of falling, self-efficacy, quality of life, and psychological outcomes in patients with OA, based on randomized controlled trials published. Findings from the literature suggest that CAM exercises demonstrate considerable promise in the management of OA. Future studies require rigorous randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes.	Chyu, Ming-Chien;von Bergen, Vera;Brismee, Jean-Michel;Zhang, Yan;Yeh, James K;Shen, Chwan-Li	2011
22042786	Hot flashes: a review of pathophysiology and treatment modalities.	Many therapies are being studied for the treatment of hot flashes for individuals with cancer, yet few studies have demonstrated safe and effective clinical benefit for those who suffer from this distressing symptom. The purpose of this paper is to assess the current options for the management of hot flashes, examining key endpoints from recent clinical trials and reviewing future directions. Hot flashes are a common stressful symptom for individuals with cancer, particularly women with a history of breast cancer and men with prostate cancer. Lifestyle modifications are proposed as the first step in the management of less severe hot flashes. Several publications have addressed nonhormonal agents as a treatment option for hot flashes. Newer antidepressant and anticonvulsant agents have been studied and show potential in treating vasomotor symptoms. Although many complementary and alternative therapies, including herbal medications and phytoestrogens, have been studied for the treatment of hot flashes, none are clinically recommended at this time. Additionally, further evidence is needed for supportive exercise such as yoga and relaxation techniques. Acupuncture may warrant further investigation in the reduction and severity of hot flashes in both men and women. Hormonal therapies, including estrogens and progestogens, are the most well-known and efficient agents in alleviating hot flashes; however, the safety of these agents is disputable.

22041945	Yoga for chronic low back pain: a randomized trial.	BACKGROUND: Previous studies indicate that yoga may be an effective treatment for chronic or recurrent low back pain. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of yoga and usual care for chronic or recurrent low back pain. DESIGN: Parallel-group, randomized, controlled trial using computer-generated randomization conducted from April 2007 to March 2010. Outcomes were assessed by postal questionnaire. (International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Register: ISRCTN 81079604) SETTING: 13 non-National Health Service premises in the United Kingdom. PATIENTS: 313 adults with chronic or recurrent low back pain. INTERVENTION: Yoga (n = 156) or usual care (n = 157). All participants received a back pain education booklet. The intervention group was offered a 12-class, gradually progressing yoga program delivered by 12 teachers over 3 months. MEASUREMENTS: Scores on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) at 3 (primary outcome), 6, and 12 (secondary outcomes) months; pain, pain self-efficacy, and general health measures at 3, 6, and 12 months (secondary outcomes). RESULTS: 93 (60%) patients offered yoga attended at least 3 of the first 6 sessions and at least 3 other sessions. The yoga group had better back function at 3, 6, and 12 months than the usual care group. The adjusted mean RMDQ score was 2.17 points (95% CI, 1.03 to 3.31 points) lower in the yoga group at 3 months, 1.48 points (CI, 0.33 to 2.62 points) lower at 6 months, and 1.57 points (CI, 0.42 to 2.71 points) lower at 12 months. The yoga and usual care groups had similar back pain and general health scores at 3, 6, and 12 months, and the yoga group had higher pain self-efficacy scores at 3 and 6 months but not at 12 months. Two of the 157 usual care participants and 12 of the 156 yoga participants reported adverse events, mostly increased pain. LIMITATION: There were missing data for the primary outcome (yoga group, n = 21; usual care group, n = 18) and differential missing data (more in the yoga group) for secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION: Offering a 12-week yoga program to adults with chronic or recurrent low back pain led to greater improvements in back function than did usual care.

22034770	[Physical therapy for parkinson's disease].	Parkinson's disease is a complex neurologic and progressive incapacitating disease. Parkinson's disease severely threatens the quality of live and the number of patients worldwide is expected to rise considerably in the coming decade due to aging of the population. Even with optimal medical management using drugs or neurosurgery, patients are faced with progressively increasing impairments (e.g. in speech, mental and movement related functions), and restrictions in participation (e.g. domestic life and social activities). Physical therapy is often prescribed next to medical treatment but there is a lack of uniform treatment. A systematic literature search for guidelines, systematic reviews, trials, and expert opinions lead to a better understanding. The key question: Is physiotherapy able to optimally treat the Parkinson's disease symptoms? In which way, how and on which scientific bases can the physiotherapist participate to improve autonomy and to help them living independently and avoid, as long as possible, institutionalization? This article has integrated clinical research findings to provide clinicians with an overview to physical therapist management of disorders in people with Parkinson's disease. An Evidence-Based Physical Therapy Guideline providing practice recommendations was developed by the Royal Dutch Society for Physical Therapy (KNGF). Evidence from research was supplemented with clinical expertise and patients values. Randomized clinical trials reflect specific core areas of physical therapy, that is, transfer, posture, balance, reaching and grasping, gait and physical condition. Another aspect is that of educating patients (as well as their partners and family) about the disease process and the benefits of exercise therapy. Alternative therapies can be helpful like Tai Chi, virtual games, dancing, yoga, ball games for example.	Hubert, M	2011 Sep
22034522	Mind magic: a pilot study of preventive mind-body-based stress reduction in behaviorally inhibited and activated children.	PURPOSE OF STUDY: The aim of this pilot study was to examine a mind-body-based preventive intervention program and to determine relationships between children's behavioral inhibition system (BIS) and behavioral activation system, stress, and stress reduction after the program. DESIGN OF STUDY: Children participated in the program (n=30) or in a control condition (n=24). They filled out questionnaires before and after the program and reported their levels of stress before and after each of the five sessions. METHOD: The program consisted of weekly sessions. Each session incorporated yoga postures, visualization, and social exercises. Breathing techniques were integrated. FINDINGS: Stress reductions were only seen in the intervention group and mainly in children with high BIS--irrespective of their behavioral activation system. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that children with high BIS may benefit from a mind-body-based stress reduction program.	Jellesma, Francine C;Cornelis, Janine	2012 Mar
22031640	Progressive pigmentary purpura.	A 58-year-old man presented for evaluation and treatment of non-tender, non-pruritic, annular patches on the right temple and frontal aspect of the scalp that reddened with exercise. A biopsy specimen showed a purpuric dermatitis with features of lymphocytic vasculitis; a diagnosis of exercise-induced progressive pigmentary purpura was made. Whereas progressive pigmentary purpura is purported to be caused by exercise, other similar appearing entities are associated with exercise, namely exercise-induced vasculitis (EIV). EIV may be considered as an acute microcirculatory deficiency and thermoregulation decompensation that occurs after episodes of exhaustive major muscular activity or after unusual or excessive exercise. The combination of age greater than 50 years, heat, and prolonged exercise are the most potent contributing factors. This is the first report of exercise-induced progressive pigmentary purpura.

22028523	Nonpharmacological treatment of epilepsy.	Nonpharmacological treatment of epilepsy includes surgery, vagal nerve stimulation, ketogenic diet, and other alternative/complementary therapies, e.g., yoga, Ayurveda, electroencephalography (EEG) biofeedback technique, aerobic exercise, music therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, acupuncture, and herbal remedies (traditional Chinese medicine). Alternative therapies, despite the term, should not be considered as an alternative to antiepileptic medication; they complement accepted drug treatment. Alternative therapies like yoga, through techniques that relax the body and mind, reduce stress, improve seizure control, and also improve quality of life. Ketogenic diet is a safe and effective treatment for intractable epilepsies; it has been recommended since 1921. The diet induces ketosis, which may control seizures. The most successful treatment of epilepsy is with modern antiepileptic drugs, which can achieve control of seizures in 70-80% cases. Patients opt for alternative therapies because they may be dissatisfied with antiepileptic drugs due to their unpleasant side effects, the long duration of treatment, failure to achieve control of seizures, cultural beliefs and, in the case of women, because they wish to get pregnant Surgical treatment may lead to physical and psychological sequelae and is an option only for a minority of patients. This article presents supportive evidence from randomized controlled trials done to assess the benefit of non-pharmacological treatment.	Saxena, V S;Nadkarni, V V	2011 Jul
22026964	Traditional Chinese medicine diagnoses in a sample of women with fibromyalgia.	BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) offers various treatment modalities guided by TCM diagnoses. In the United States, acupuncture is a commonly employed TCM method for treating a variety of chronic illnesses. Three systematic reviews have been reported recently, reaching differing conclusions about the efficacy of acupuncture for the treatment of fibromyalgia (FM). Among the FM acupuncture studies considered in these reviews, none used TCM diagnosis as an inclusion/exclusion criterion or adjusted treatment based on TCM diagnosis. Overlooking TCM diagnosis may be a reason for such disparate results. PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVE: To obtain TCM diagnoses in a sample of women meeting 1990 American College of Rheumatology criteria for FM who were recruited for a yoga study and to investigate whether there is significant variability. METHODS/DESIGN: Two TCM practitioners conducted baseline TCM diagnostic examinations on 56 women with FM. A consensus diagnosis was reached based on standardised history, palpation and examination. Canonical discriminate analysis identified two baseline items which predicted TCM diagnosis. SETTING: School of Nursing, Oregon Health & Science University. PARTICIPANTS: Women, ages 23-75, with FM recruited to a yoga intervention study. RESULTS: Three primary TCM diagnoses were found in the population: Qi and Blood Deficiency (46.4%, CI 33.0% to 60.36%), Qi and Blood Stagnation (26.8%, CI 15.8% to 40.3%), and Liver Qi Stagnation (19.6%, CI 10.2% to 32.4%). CONCLUSION: It is likely that previous studies of FM were treating a heterogeneous study population where variable results might be expected. Future acupuncture studies should either control for TCM diagnosis or consider its usefulness as an inclusion/exclusion criterion.

22025101	A randomized trial comparing yoga, stretching, and a self-care book for chronic low back pain.	BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain is a common problem lacking highly effective treatment options. Small trials suggest that yoga may have benefits for this condition. This trial was designed to determine whether yoga is more effective than conventional stretching exercises or a self-care book for primary care patients with chronic low back pain. METHODS: A total of 228 adults with chronic low back pain were randomized to 12 weekly classes of yoga (92 patients) or conventional stretching exercises (91 patients) or a self-care book (45 patients). Back-related functional status (modified Roland Disability Questionnaire, a 23-point scale) and bothersomeness of pain (an 11-point numerical scale) at 12 weeks were the primary outcomes. Outcomes were assessed at baseline, 6, 12, and 26 weeks by interviewers unaware of treatment group. RESULTS: After adjustment for baseline values, 12-week outcomes for the yoga group were superior to those for the self-care group (mean difference for function, -2.5 [95% CI, -3.7 to -1.3]; P < .001; mean difference for symptoms, -1.1 [95% CI, -1.7 to -0.4]; P < .001). At 26 weeks, function for the yoga group remained superior (mean difference, -1.8 [95% CI, -3.1 to -0.5]; P < .001). Yoga was not superior to conventional stretching exercises at any time point. CONCLUSION: Yoga classes were more effective than a self-care book, but not more effective than stretching classes, in improving function and reducing symptoms due to chronic low back pain, with benefits lasting at least several months.

22022128	Effect of integral yoga on psychological and health variables and their correlations.	OBJECTIVE: Certain psychological and health variables are commonly measured in India. This study evaluates the effects of integral yoga practices on these variables and also the consistency of correlations observed between them. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was a pre-post intervention study. The variables were measured at the beginning and the end of a one-month yoga course. There was no control group.The study was carried out at Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana (S-VYASA) University, in its rural campus south of Bangalore. Based on health criteria, 108 subjects were selected out of 198 volunteers to form the experimental yoga group. Ages ranged from 17 to 63 years. The yogasanas (postures), pranayama (breathing exercises), relaxation techniques, meditation, chanting and lectures were the components of yoga intervention. The variables measured were sustained attention, emotional intelligence - EQ, general health - GHQ, guna personality - sattva, rajas and tamas. RESULTS: Significant pre-post changes were found in all variables. Significant correlations were found between the following pairs: The two sustained attention variables; emotional intelligence and general health; GHQ and tamas; sattva and tamas; and rajas and tamas. CONCLUSION: The study shows that there were significant changes in all variables (P< 0.001) except in sattva. It also confirms that EQ and general health variables correlate significantly with each other and negatively with tamas. EQ and tamas form positive and negative predictors of health respectively. Sattva correlates positively with EQ suggesting that a sattvic personality indicates better self-control. This suggests that, by improving guna personality, long-term yoga practice may stabilize EQ.

22022127	Prevalence and pattern of stress relaxation practices in Ahmedabad city: A cross-sectional study.	BACKGROUND: Research has shown the growing importance of stress relaxation practices (SRPs) in many noncommunicable diseases. But there is little information on the prevalence of SRPs in Indian population. OBJECTIVES: To study the prevalence of different types of SRPs and their sociodemographic profile. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was carried out in Ahmedabad city, Gujarat, India. One ward from each zone of the city was selected by stratified sampling. All individuals above 20 years were included in the study. Detailed information regarding different SRPs practiced by the participants was collected in a standard pretested proforma by house-to-house survey. Univariate regression analysis was applied to compare the groups. RESULTS: Of 1157 persons surveyed, 904 were included in the final analysis. Of these, 310 (34.3%) were doing SRPs and 594 (65.7%) were not doing any type of SRPs. Respondents doing SRPs were compared with non-SRP group. Significant (P<0.05) differences were noticed between the two groups; in females, it was (SRP 58.4% vs non-SRP 49.8%) in the age group 40 to 59 years (44.2 vs 33.8%), those from sedentary occupation (93.9% vs 85.4%), the persons belonging to upper socioeconomic status (70.6% vs 61.8%), and living in central and western zones (66.5% vs 24.6%) and had less number of diabetes (SRP 10.8% vs non-SRP 19.7%) and hypertension (20.7% vs 34.2%). People doing SRPs were able to maintain balance between work and other activities than non-SRPs group (198/310, 63.9% vs 42/594, 7.1%). Among SRPs, majority (243, 78.4%) were involved in religious activities followed by yoga, 36(11.6%), and meditation, 15 (4.8%). CONCLUSION: Persons practicing SRPs in Ahmedabad are more likely to be above 40 years of age, females, college educated, in sedentary occupation, from upper and middle class, married and living in new-west and central zones, and were less likely to have diabetes and hypertension as compared with those who do not practice SRPs.

22022126	Increased Hatha yoga experience predicts lower body mass index and reduced medication use in women over 45 years.	BACKGROUND: Yoga has been shown to have many short-term health benefits, but little is known about the extent to which these benefits accrue over a long time frame or with frequent practice. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which body mass index (BMI) and medication use in a sample of female yoga practitioners over 45 years varied according to the length and frequency of yoga practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We administered online surveys to 211 female yoga practitioners aged 45 to 80 years. We used regression analyses to evaluate the relationship of extent of yoga experience to both BMI and medication use after accounting for age and lifestyle factors. We also conducted comparisons with 182 matched controls. RESULTS: Participants had practiced yoga for as long as 50 years and for up to 28 hours per week. There were significant inverse relationships between yoga experience and both BMI and medication load. These significant relationships remained after accounting for age and lifestyle factors. When we computed yoga experience in terms of total calendar years, without accounting for hours of practice, significant relationships did not remain. However, there was no obesity in the 49 participants with more than 25 years of yoga practice. Yoga practitioners were less likely than non-practitioners to use medication for metabolic syndrome, mood disorders, inflammation, and pain. CONCLUSIONS: A long-term yoga practice was associated with little or no obesity in a non-probability sample of women over 45 years. Relationships showed a dose-response effect, with increased yoga experience predicting lower BMI and reduced medication use.

22022125	A comparative study of slow and fast suryanamaskar on physiological function.	BACKGROUND: Numerous scientific studies have reported beneficial physiological changes after short- and long-term yoga training. Suryanamaskar (SN) is an integral part of modern yoga training and may be performed either in a slow or rapid manner. As there are few studies on SN, we conducted this study to determine the differential effect of 6 months training in the fast and slow versions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 42 school children in the age group of 12-16 years were randomly divided into two groups of 21 each. Group I and Group II received 6 months training in performance of slow suryanamaskar (SSN) and fast suryanamaskar (FSN), respectively. RESULTS: Training in SSN produced a significant decrease in diastolic pressure. In contrast, training in FSN produced a significant increase in systolic pressure. Although there was a highly significant increase in isometric hand grip (IHG) strength and hand grip endurance (HGE) in both the groups, the increase in HGE in FSN group was significantly more than in SSN group. Pulmonary function tests showed improvements in both the groups though intergroup comparison showed no significance difference. Maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximum expiratory pressure increased significantly in both the groups with increase of MIP in FSN group being more significant than in SSN. CONCLUSION: The present study reports that SN has positive physiological benefits as evidenced by improvement of pulmonary function, respiratory pressures, hand grip strength and endurance, and resting cardiovascular parameters. It also demonstrates the differences between SN training when performed in a slow and fast manner, concluding that the effects of FSN are similar to physical aerobic exercises, whereas the effects of SSN are similar to those of yoga training.

22022124	Meditation induces a positive response during stress events in young Indian adults.	BACKGROUND: Relaxation techniques like meditation have been found to be beneficial in reducing stress. AIM: The aim was to find out the effect of the Integrated Amrita Meditation (IAM) technique on the response to life changes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The IAM technique, progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) technique, and the Life Changes Questionnaire (LCQ) were used. LCQ was culturally adapted to the Indian population. One hundred and fifty subjects were randomized into IAM, PMR, and Control groups. LCQ scores were documented in all groups at 0 h, 48 h, 2 months, and 8 months after the training. STATISTICS ANALYSIS: Within groups, comparison was done by the paired t-test and between groups by ANCOVA. RESULTS: The new LCQ was analyzed using split-half reliability and was found to be having a correlation coefficient 0.96. On within group analysis, the IAM group showed a significant decrease in LCQ scores (P = 0.004) in the second visit which was maintained in the third (P = 0.003) and fourth visits (P = 0.001). Within the PMR group, there was a significant decrease (P = 0.006) in the third visit and fourth visits (P = 0.001). No significant change was seen within the control group in any of the visits. The decrease in LCQ scores in the IAM group was significant at the end of 8 months when compared to the Control group (P < 0.05) whereas the decrease in the PMR group was not significant in comparison with the control group. CONCLUSION: The IAM technique is an efficient tool in reducing stress as measured by LCQ.

22022123	Effect of an integrated approach of yoga therapy on quality of life in osteoarthritis of the knee joint: A randomized control study.	AIM: This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of addition of integrated yoga therapy to therapeutic exercises in osteoarthritis (OA) of knee joints. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective randomized active control trial. A total of t participants with OA of knee joints between 35 and 80 years (yoga, 59.56 +/- 9.54 and control, 59.42 +/- 10.66) from the outpatient department of Dr. John's Orthopedic Center, Bengaluru, were randomly assigned to receive yoga or physiotherapy exercises after transcutaneous electrical stimulation and ultrasound treatment of the affected knee joints. Both groups practiced supervised intervention (40 min per day) for 2 weeks (6 days per week) with followup for 3 months. The module of integrated yoga consisted of shithilikaranavyayama (loosening and strengthening), asanas, relaxation techniques, pranayama, meditation and didactic lectures on yama, niyama, jnana yoga, bhakti yoga, and karma yoga for a healthy lifestyle change. The control group also had supervised physiotherapy exercises. A total of 118 (yoga) and 117 (control) were available for final analysis. RESULTS: Significant differences were observed within (P < 0.001, Wilcoxon's) and between groups (P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U-test) on all domains of the Short Form-36 (P < 0.004), with better results in the yoga group than in the control group, both at 15(th) day and 90(th) day. CONCLUSION: An integrated approach of yoga therapy is better than therapeutic exercises as an adjunct to transcutaneous electrical stimulation and ultrasound treatment in improving knee disability and quality of life in patients with OA knees.

22022122	Exploring the therapeutic effects of yoga and its ability to increase quality of life.	The objective of this study is to assess the findings of selected articles regarding the therapeutic effects of yoga and to provide a comprehensive review of the benefits of regular yoga practice. As participation rates in mind-body fitness programs such as yoga continue to increase, it is important for health care professionals to be informed about the nature of yoga and the evidence of its many therapeutic effects. Thus, this manuscript provides information regarding the therapeutic effects of yoga as it has been studied in various populations concerning a multitude of different ailments and conditions. Therapeutic yoga is defined as the application of yoga postures and practice to the treatment of health conditions and involves instruction in yogic practices and teachings to prevent reduce or alleviate structural, physiological, emotional and spiritual pain, suffering or limitations. Results from this study show that yogic practices enhance muscular strength and body flexibility, promote and improve respiratory and cardiovascular function, promote recovery from and treatment of addiction, reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and chronic pain, improve sleep patterns, and enhance overall well-being and quality of life.

22021757	Yoga respiratory training improves respiratory function and cardiac sympathovagal balance in elderly subjects: a randomised controlled trial.	OBJECTIVES: Since ageing is associated with a decline in pulmonary function, heart rate variability and spontaneous baroreflex, and recent studies suggest that yoga respiratory exercises may improve respiratory and cardiovascular function, we hypothesised that yoga respiratory training may improve respiratory function and cardiac autonomic modulation in healthy elderly subjects. DESIGN: 76 healthy elderly subjects were enrolled in a randomised control trial in Brazil and 29 completed the study (age 68 +/- 6 years, 34% males, body mass index 25 +/- 3 kg/m(2)). Subjects were randomised into a 4-month training program (2 classes/week plus home exercises) of either stretching (control, n=14) or respiratory exercises (yoga, n=15). Yoga respiratory exercises (Bhastrika) consisted of rapid forced expirations followed by inspiration through the right nostril, inspiratory apnoea with generation of intrathoracic negative pressure, and expiration through the left nostril. Pulmonary function, maximum expiratory and inspiratory pressures (PE(max) and PI(max), respectively), heart rate variability and blood pressure variability for spontaneous baroreflex determination were determined at baseline and after 4 months. RESULTS: Subjects in both groups had similar demographic parameters. Physiological variables did not change after 4 months in the control group. However, in the yoga group, there were significant increases in PE(max) (34%, p<0.0001) and PI(max) (26%, p<0.0001) and a significant decrease in the low frequency component (a marker of cardiac sympathetic modulation) and low frequency/high frequency ratio (marker of sympathovagal balance) of heart rate variability (40%, p<0.001). Spontaneous baroreflex did not change, and quality of life only marginally increased in the yoga group. CONCLUSION: Respiratory yoga training may be beneficial for the elderly healthy population by improving respiratory function and sympathovagal balance.

22021105	Indigenous perspectives on depression in rural regions of India and the United States.	Depression is a major health concern in India, yet indigenous Indian perspectives on depression have often been disregarded in favor of Western conceptualizations. The present study used quantitative and qualitative measures modeled on the Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue (EMIC) to elicit beliefs about the symptoms, causes, treatments, and stigma associated with depression. Data were collected from 92 students at a university in the Himalayan region of Northern India and from 97 students at a university in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. U.S. participants in this study were included primarily to approximate a "Western baseline" (in which professional conceptions of depression are predominantly rooted) from which to elucidate Indian perspectives. Compared to U.S. participants, Indian participants were more likely to view restive symptoms (e.g., irritation, anxiety, difficulty thinking) as common features of depression, to view depression as the result of personally controllable causes (e.g., failure), to endorse social support and spiritual reflection or relaxation (e.g., yoga, meditation) as useful means for dealing with depression, and to associate stigma with depression. Efforts aimed at reducing depression among Indians should focus more on implementing effective and culturally acceptable interventions, such as yoga, meditation, and increasing social support.

21992583	Yoga as a complementary treatment for smoking cessation in women.	BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking remains the leading preventable cause of death among American women. Aerobic exercise has shown promise as an aid to smoking cessation because it improves affect and reduces nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Studies outside the realm of smoking cessation have shown that yoga practice also reduces perceived stress and negative affect. METHODS: This pilot study examines the feasibility and initial efficacy of yoga as a complementary therapy for smoking cessation. Fifty-five women were given 8-week group-based cognitive behavioral therapy for smoking cessation and were randomized to a twice-weekly program of Vinyasa yoga or a general health and wellness program (contact control). The primary outcome measure was 7-day point prevalence abstinence at the end of treatment validated by saliva cotinine testing. Longitudinal analyses were also conducted to examine the effect of intervention on smoking cessation at 3- and 6-month follow-up. We examined the effects of the intervention on potential mediating variables (e.g., confidence in quitting smoking, self-efficacy), as well as measures of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and perceived health (SF-36). RESULTS: At end of treatment, women in the yoga group had a greater 7-day point-prevalence abstinence rate than controls (odds ratio [OR], 4.56; 95% CI, 1.1-18.6). Abstinence remained higher among yoga participants through the six month assessment (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.34-6.92), although differences were no longer statistically significant. Women participating in the yoga program also showed reduced anxiety and improvements in perceived health and well-being when compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga may be an efficacious complementary therapy for smoking cessation among women.

21992466	Relaxation response-based yoga improves functioning in young children with autism: a pilot study.	OBJECTIVES: The study objectives were to develop and objectively assess the therapeutic effect of a novel movement-based complementary and alternative medicine approach for children with an autism-spectrum disorder (ASD). DESIGN: A within-subject analysis comparing pre- to post-treatment scores on two standard measures of childhood behavioral problems was used. SETTINGS AND LOCATION: The intervention and data analysis occurred at a tertiary care, medical school teaching hospital. SUBJECTS: Twenty-four (24) children aged 3-16 years with a diagnosis of an ASD comprised the study group. INTERVENTION: The efficacy of an 8-week multimodal yoga, dance, and music therapy program based on the relaxation response (RR) was developed and examined. OUTCOME MEASURES: The study outcome was measured using The Behavioral Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2) and the Aberrant Behavioral Checklist (ABC). RESULTS: Robust changes were found on the BASC-2, primarily for 5-12-year-old children. Unexpectedly, the post-treatment scores on the Atypicality scale of the BASC-2, which measures some of the core features of autism, changed significantly (p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: A movement-based, modified RR program, involving yoga and dance, showed efficacy in treating behavioral and some core features of autism, particularly for latency-age children.

21982141	Meditation for the management of adjustment disorder anxiety and depression.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of Meditation training on patients with adjustment disorder with anxiety and depression. METHOD: In a pre-test/post-test control group design, patients (N = 30) with adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depression, were screened through a Clinical Global Impression-severity/Improvement Scale, Beck's Anxiety, Beck's Depression Inventory, and Global Assessment of Functioning. Sessions of meditation training (28 weeks) were held using the model of Yoga Meditation. The difference of means (pre- and post-assessment) was tested using a paired t-test method. RESULTS: Experimental group and control groups were similar at base line, whereas after concluding the 28th week of meditation practice a significant mean difference (t value: CGI-S 2.47 > .05; CGI-I2.82 > 0.05; BAI 17.58 > 0.05; BDI 10.13 > 0.05; GAF 12.29 > 0.05) was found between both groups. There was an incremental change in selected assessment parameters in both groups. But changes were more significant in pre- and post-assessment of experimental group.

21975737	Exercise training for adults with chronic kidney disease.	BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem. In the National Kidney Foundation Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines it is stressed that lifestyle issues such as physical activity should be seen as cornerstones of the therapy. The physical fitness in adults with CKD is so reduced that it impinges on ability and capacity to perform activities in everyday life and occupational tasks. An increasing number of studies have been published regarding health effects of various regular exercise programmes in adults with CKD and in renal transplant patients. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to: 1) assess the effects of regular exercise in adults with CKD and kidney transplant patients; and 2) determine how the exercise programme should be designed (e.g. type, duration, intensity, frequency of exercise) to be able to affect physical fitness and functioning, level of physical activity, cardiovascular dimensions, nutrition, lipids, glucose metabolism, systemic inflammation, muscle morphology and morphometrics, dropout rates, compliance, adverse events and mortality. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Biosis, Pedro, Amed, AgeLine, PsycINFO and KoreaMed. We also handsearched reference lists of review articles and included studies, conference proceeding's abstracts. There were no language restrictions.Date of last search: May 2010. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included any randomised controlled trial (RCT) enrolling adults with CKD or kidney transplant recipients undergoing any type of physical exercise intervention undertaken for eight weeks or more. Studies using less than eight weeks exercise, those only recommending an increase in physical activity, and studies in which co-interventions are not applied or given to both groups were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and assessment of study and data quality were performed independently by the two authors. Continuous outcome data are presented as standardised mean difference (SMD) or mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). MAIN RESULTS: Forty-five studies, randomising 1863 participants were included in this review. Thirty two studies presented data that could be meta-analysed. Types of exercise training included cardiovascular training, mixed cardiovascular and resistance training, resistance-only training and yoga. Some studies used supervised exercise interventions and others used unsupervised interventions. Exercise intensity was classed as 'high' or 'low', duration of individual exercise sessions ranged from 20 minutes/session to 110 minutes/session, and study duration was from two to 18 months. Seventeen per cent of studies were classed as having an overall low risk of bias, 33% as moderate, and 49% as having a high risk of bias.The results shows that regular exercise significantly improved: 1) physical fitness (aerobic capacity, 24 studies, 847 participants: SMD -0.56, 95% CI -0.70 to -0.42; walking capacity, 7 studies, 191 participants: SMD -0.36, 95% CI-0.65 to -0.06); 2) cardiovascular dimensions (resting diastolic blood pressure, 11 studies, 419 participants: MD 2.32 mm Hg, 95% CI 0.59 to 4.05; resting systolic blood pressure, 9 studies, 347 participants: MD 6.08 mm Hg, 95% CI 2.15 to 10.12; heart rate, 11 studies, 229 participants: MD 6 bpm, 95% CI 10 to 2); 3) some nutritional parameters (albumin, 3 studies, 111 participants: MD -2.28 g/L, 95% CI -4.25 to -0.32; pre-albumin, 3 studies, 111 participants: MD - 44.02 mg/L, 95% CI -71.52 to -16.53; energy intake, 4 studies, 97 participants: SMD -0.47, 95% CI -0.88 to -0.05); and 4) health-related quality of life. Results also showed how exercise should be designed in order to optimise the effect. Other outcomes had insufficient evidence. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence for significant beneficial effects of regular exercise on physical fitness, walking capacity, cardiovascular dimensions (e.g. blood pressure and heart rate), health-related quality of life and some nutritional parameters in adults with CKD. Other outcomes had insufficient evidence due to the lack of data from RCTs. The design of the exercise intervention causes difference in effect size and should be considered when prescribing exercise with the aim of affecting a certain outcome. Future RCTs should focus more on the effects of resistance training interventions or mixed cardiovascular- and resistance training as these exercise types have not been studied as much as cardiovascular exercise.

25572758	Association of fructosamine to indices of dyslipidemia in older adults with type 2 diabetes.	AIMS: To evaluate the association of serum fructosamine values to lipid profiles and to other indices of glycemia both at baseline and over time in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). METHODS: Forty adults aged 45 or older with T2DM, not taking insulin, and an HbA1c of 6-10% were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial regarding the effects of an 8-week yoga program on glycemia and related cardiovascular disease risk indices in adults with T2DM. Fasting blood was drawn to assess glycemia (HbA1c, glucose, and fructosamine) and dyslipidemia (LDL, HDL, total cholesterol, cholesterol:HDL ratio, LDL:HDL ratio, and triglycerides) pre and post-intervention. Because the relation of fructosamine to other indices of glycemia and to lipid profiles did not differ between treatment groups either at baseline or over time, groups were pooled for analysis. RESULTS: Baseline fructosamine values were significantly correlated with HbA1c (r=0.77, P<0.0001), glucose (r=0.72, P<0.0001), LDL:HDL ratio (r=0.46, P=0.01), cholesterol:HDL ratio (r=0.55, P=0.002), and triglycerides (r=0.39, P=0.032), but not to other lipid indices at baseline. Change in fructosamine over 8 weeks was significantly correlated with change in HbA1c (r=0.63, P=0.0001), glucose (r=0.39, P=0.029), cholesterol (r=0.65, P<0.0001), LDL (r=0.55, P=0.001), LDL:HDL ratio (r=0.53, P=0.003), and cholesterol:HDL ratio (r=0.52, P=0.002), and was more strongly related to change in lipid values than were other indices of glycemia. CONCLUSIONS: Fructosamine was significantly correlated with measures of dyslipidemia and glycemia both at baseline and over time, and may represent a relatively sensitive and low cost index of short to medium term change in both glycemia and certain lipid profiles. However, findings from this small pilot study should be interpreted with caution, and warrant replication in larger prospective studies.	Innes, Kim E;Selfe, Terry Kit;Vishnu, Abhishek	2011 Oct-Dec
23511042	Effect of yogic exercises on symptoms of musculoskeletal disorders of upper limbs among computer users: a randomised controlled trial.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) are very common in regular computer users and leading cause of work related illness. The objective of the present study is to evaluate effectiveness of yogic exercises in the improvement of symptoms of MSDs of upper limbs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 60 study participants were randomly divided into two groups that is yoga with counselling and only counselling group for 12 weeks. Symptom severity and functional status were assessed using the self administered Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire and predesigned symptom questionnaire before and after intervention. RESULTS: There was significant reduction in symptom severity score (P = 0.002) and improvement in functional status score in yoga with counselling group when compared to only counselling group. There is also a significant decrease in self reported symptoms like CT myalgia symptom (P = 0.019) and improvement in weakness. CONCLUSION: The present study showed a yoga based regimen is more effective than counselling alone in relieving symptoms of computer related musculoskeletal disorders.

23362725	Effect of yogic package on rheumatoid arthritis.	This study aimed at studying the effect of yogic package (YP) with some selected pranayama, cleansing practices and meditation on pain intensity, inflammation, stiffness, pulse rate (PR), blood pressure (BP), lymphocyte count (LC), C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum uric acid (UA) level among subjects of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Randomized control group design was employed to generate pre and post data on participants and controls. Repealed Measure ANOVAs with Bonferroni adjustment were applied to check significant overall difference among pre and post means of participants and controls by using PASW (SPSS Inc. 18th Version). Observed result favored statistically significant positive effect of YP on selected RA parameters and symptoms under study at P<0.05, 0.01 and 0.001 respectively that showed remarkable improvement in RA severity after 40-day practice of YP. It concluded that YP is a significant means to reduce intensity of RA.	Singh, Vijay Kumar;Bhandari, R B;Rana, Budhi Bal	2011 Oct-Dec
23362721	Effects of yoga on brain wave coherence in executives.	Aim of this study was to assess the effect of Self Management of Excessive Tension (SMET), a yoga based stress management program on brain wave coherence. Brain wave recordings were taken with Brain Master 2 Channel EEG (version-2.0). The subjects for the study were 72 corporate executives, 48.75 +/- 3.86 years of mean age referred from Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited. EEG data was recorded on the first and sixth day of 5 days SMET program. A complete statistical and spectral analysis showed 19.31% increase (p=0.03) in delta, 5.04% increase (p=0.65) in theta, 15.40% increase (p=0.09) in alpha, 1.67% decrease (p=0.54) in beta and 18.68% increase (p=0.07) in gamma wave coherence between pre and post intervention measurements. Taken together, these results suggest that participation in a SMET program was associated with improvement in emotional stability and may have implications for 'Executive Efficiency'. Because before and after designs limit inferences about intervention effects, further research is warranted to explore the effects of SMET program for stress management using a larger, randomized controlled trial.

21951784	Analysis of oligomeric stability of insulin analogs using hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry.	Insulin analog products for subcutaneous injection are prepared as solutions in which insulin analog molecules exist in several oligomeric states. Oligomeric stability can affect their onset and duration of action and has been exploited in designing them. To investigate the oligomeric stability of insulin analog products having different pharmacokinetics, we performed hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX/MS), which is a rapid method to analyze dynamic aspects of protein structures. Two rapid-acting analogs (lispro and glulisine) incorporated deuteriums more and faster than recombinant human insulin, whereas a long-acting analog (glargine) and two intermediate-acting preparations (protamine-containing formulations) incorporated them less and more slowly. Kinetic analysis revealed that the number of slowly exchanged hydrogens (D(s)) (k<0.01 min(-1)) accounted for the difference in HDX reactivity among analogs. Furthermore, we found correlations between HDX kinetics and pharmacokinetics reported previously. Their maximum serum concentration (C(max)) was linearly correlated with D(s) (r=0.88) and the number of maximum exchangeable hydrogens (D(infinity)) (r=0.89). The maximum drug concentration time (t(max)) was also correlated with reciprocals of D(s) and D(infinity) (r=0.86 and r=0.96, respectively). Here we demonstrate the ability of HDX/MS to evaluate oligomeric stability of insulin analog products.	Nakazawa, Shiori;Hashii, Noritaka;Harazono, Akira;Kawasaki, Nana	2012 Jan 1
21951628	Therapeutic perspectives in hypertension: novel means for renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system modulation and emerging device-based approaches.	The conventional antihypertensive therapies including renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists (converting enzyme inhibitors, receptor blockers, renin inhibitors, and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers), diuretics, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers are variably successful in achieving the challenging target blood pressure values in hypertensive patients. Difficult to treat hypertension is still a commonly observed problem world-wide. A number of drugs are considered to be used as novel therapies for hypertension. Renalase supplementation, vasopeptidase inhibitors, endothelin antagonists, and especially aldosterone antagonists (aldosterone synthase inhibitors and novel selective mineralocorticoid receptor blockers) are considered an option in resistant hypertension. In addition, the aldosterone antagonists as well as (pro)renin receptor blockers or AT(2) receptor agonists might attenuate end-organ damage. This array of medications has now been complemented by a number of new approaches of non-pharmacological strategies including vaccination, genomic interference, controlled breathing, baroreflex activation, and probably most successfully renal denervation techniques. However, the progress on innovative therapies seems to be slow and the problem of resistant hypertension and proper blood pressure control appears to be still persisting. Therefore the regimens of currently available drugs are being fine-tuned, resulting in the establishment of several novel fixed-dose combinations including triple combinations with the aim to facilitate proper blood pressure control. It remains an exciting question which approach will confer the best blood pressure control and risk reduction in this tricky disease.	Unger, Thomas;Paulis, Ludovit;Sica, Domenic A	2011 Nov
21946964	An investigation into the health benefits of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) for people living with a range of chronic physical illnesses in New Zealand.	AIM: To establish the efficacy of Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) for people with chronic health problems in managing symptoms and coping with their illness in an Aotearoa/New Zealand context. METHOD: Twenty-nine participants completed a wait-list control study. Physical and psychological health and well-being were measured before, after and 6 months after the 8-week training programme using a variety of internationally recognised screening tools. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements were demonstrated in almost all categories measured. CONCLUSION: MBSR demonstrated health benefits for chronic illness sufferers. An economical and effective adjunctive therapy for decreasing morbidity associated with chronic illness in New Zealand, MBSR provides both clinicians and patients with an additional option for the better management of chronic illness.

21944658	Is yoga effective for pain? A systematic review of randomized clinical trials.	OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of yoga as a treatment option for any type of pain. METHOD: Seven databases were searched from their inception to February 2011. Randomized clinical trials were considered if they investigated yoga in patients with any type of pain and if they assessed pain as a primary outcome measure. The 5-point Jadad scale was used to assess methodological quality of studies. The selection of studies, data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. RESULTS: Ten randomized clinical trials (RCTs) met the inclusion criteria. Their methodological quality ranged between 1 and 4 on the Jadad scale. Nine RCTs suggested that yoga leads to a significantly greater reduction in pain than various control interventions such as standard care, self care, therapeutic exercises, relaxing yoga, touch and manipulation, or no intervention. One RCT failed to provide between group differences in pain scores. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that yoga has the potential for alleviating pain. However, definitive judgments are not possible.

21942118	Impact of yoga on haemodynamic function in healthy medical students.	OBJECTIVES: Yoga improves cardiovascular health in both healthy individuals and those with diagnosed heart disease. This study compares changes in some cardiovascular parameters before and after the practice of Yoga in healthy medical students. METHODS: Sixty-four healthy medical students (57 females and 7 males), mean age 21.3 +/- 2.6 years, attending a Special Study Module 'Role of Dhyana Yoga in Stress Management', participated in this study. Systolic (SYS) and Diastolic (DIA) blood pressure, Heart Rate (HR), Stroke Volume (SV), Cardiac output (CO), Total Peripheral Resistance (TPR), Interbeat Interval (IBI), Left Ventricular Ejection Time (LVET), Arterial Compliance (Cwk) and Ascending Aorta Impedance (Zao) were measured before and after six weeks of yogic exercises. Various exercises included asanas (Postures), pranayama (Breathing), and dhyana (Meditation). Data were analyzed using Stata for Windows. RESULTS: Two-tailed paired t-test revealed that practice ofyoga caused significant increases in HR (p < 0.05), SV (p < 0.01), CO (p < 0.001) and Cwk (p < 0.01) and decreases in TPR (p < 0.001), IBI (p < 0.05) and Zao (p < 0.001) after practising yoga for 6 weeks as compared to before yoga practice. No significant differences were, however observed in SYS, DIA, Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and LVET CONCLUSIONS: Practice of yoga even for a short period showed ability to improve most of the cardiovascular functions. Regular practice of yoga for a longer period may further improve these functions and possibly result in improved management of their daily stress.	Parshad, O;Richards, A;Asnani, M	2011 Mar
21941229	Relationship between birth weight and retinal microvasculature in newborn infants.	OBJECTIVE: The purposes of this study were to determine the normal retinal microvasculature measurements in human infants who are born at term and to determine whether birth weight influences measurements of retinal microvasculature. STUDY DESIGN: Retinal arteriole and venule measurements were obtained in a cohort of 24 infants who were born at term. Digital images of both the retinas were obtained using a digital retinal camera after pupillary dilation. RESULT: In all, 24 newborn infants born at term (12 females and 12 males) were analyzed in this study. The measured retinal arteriole diameters were from 66.8 to 147.8 mum (mean, 94.2+/-19.6 mum), and the venule diameters were from 102.0 to 167.8 mum (mean, 135.2+/-19.1 mum). Seven babies in the sample had low birth weight (LBW), while 17 babies were born with normal weight. Babies with lower birth weights had larger arteriole (113.1+/-17.9 mum vs 86.4+/-14.4 mum; P=0.0009) and venule diameters (151.7+/-14.9 mum vs 128.4+/-16.9 mum; P=0.0040). CONCLUSION: Retinal venules and arterioles in LBW babies are larger compared with those of normal-birth-weight babies. We postulate that the difference observed in our study was due to in utero pathophysiological changes that occurred in the cerebral circulation of growth-restricted fetuses.

21939118	[Complementary medicine--the facts].	The popularity of complementary medicine in the western world continues to grow. Complementary medicine has a wide scope of topics including acupuncture, hypnosis, meditation, chiropractic manipulation, tai chi, yoga, botanical and herbal supplements and many other undefined modalities such as copper bracelets, magnets, holy water etc. For most modalities the mechanism of action is unknown and the evidence of benefit is poor. Some modalities such as acupuncture, hypnosis and tai chi may improve pain and other subjective complains. It seems that most of the beneficial effects of complementary medicine are placebo effects. Complementary treatment may be associated with side effects and should not be an alternative to the conventional medicine. Complementary medicine can be used as an adjunct to the conventional medicine and should be used in full agreement with and under the supervision of the attending physician. Patients should be informed about the existing evidence and what to expect from complementary medicine. Further meticulous research should be conducted to expand our knowledge in complementary medicine.	Grossman, Ehud	2011 Aug
21937898	Effects of a yoga program on postural control, mobility, and gait speed in community-living older adults: a pilot study.	OBJECTIVES: To examine the impact of an 8-week therapeutic yoga program on postural control, mobility, rising from the floor, and gait speed in community-living older adults. DESIGN: Pretest/posttest design with an experimental group and an age-matched control group. Changes over time (pretest to posttest) were evaluated in all outcome measures using paired t tests. SETTING: The yoga class was performed at a local continuing care retirement community. All testing was performed at the site. Control-subject pretests and posttests were performed at a second continuing care retirement community. PARTICIPANTS: Eight research participants, all women, with a mean age of 84 (4.6) years, 8 control participants, 5 women and 3 men, aged 81.3 (4.9) years. Research participants were naive to yoga. INTERVENTIONS: An 8-week, 80-minute, biweekly Kripalu yoga class designed specifically for community-dwelling older adults. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Postural control (Berg Balance Scale), mobility (time to rise from the floor to standing, Timed Up and Go), gait (usual and fast gait speed), and balance confidence (Activities-Specific Balance Scale). RESULTS: All subjects attended at least 10 of the 16 classes (62% attendance). Posttest differences were found for yoga participants in balance scores (P < .003) and fast walking speed (P < .031). No other significant changes were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in postural control as measured by the Berg Balance Scale and gait as measured by fast gait speed indicate that research subjects benefited from the yoga intervention. The yoga program designed for this study included the activities of standing, sitting, and lying on the floor. Therefore, subjects perform activities during yoga that can improve postural control, mobility, and gait speed.	Zettergren, Kathleen K;Lubeski, Jennifer M;Viverito, Jaclyn M	2011 Apr-Jun
21935739	Quality of life in panic disorder: looking beyond symptom remission.	PURPOSE: Panic Disorder (PD) is a classic example of a disease where symptom remission may be achieved, yet patient quality of life (QOL) remains low, providing further support for the need to measure QOL as an additional outcome in patient care. The objectives of this review are to examine the substantial QOL impairments in PD and to determine whether modern treatments for PD, which have been proven to achieve symptom remission, have been shown to restore QOL. METHODS: We identified studies on QOL in PD from 1980 to 2010 by searching MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and PubMed databases. RESULTS: The literature reveals substantial QOL impairments in PD, often resulting in poor sense of health, frequent utilization of medical services, occupational deficiency, financial dependency, and marital strife. Modern therapies have been demonstrated to achieve symptom remission and improve QOL in PD; however, post-treatment QOL is still significantly lower than community averages. CONCLUSIONS: QOL needs to be added as an essential outcome measure in patient care. Further research should be conducted to better understand the nature of comorbidities in PD as well as to determine whether additional interventions that have been studied in other psychiatric disorders, such as exercise, meditation, yoga, humor, massage, and nutritional supplements, can be utilized to improve QOL in PD to normal community levels.

21903710	Effect of yoga on menopausal symptoms.	OBJECTIVES: To observe the effect of yoga on menopausal symptoms using a prospective, randomized, controlled and interventional study. Main outcome measures Total Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) score and three subscale scores (somatovegetative, psychological and urogenital) were measured on day 1 and day 90 in the study group which performed yoga (asana, pranayam and meditation) under supervision for three months, and were compared with the control group that did not perform yoga. MRS has been designed to measure health-related quality of life of ageing women. It consists of 11 symptoms and three subscales. RESULTS: It was observed that on day 1 the scores in both the groups were comparable. On day 90, the scores in the yoga group showed a reduction in score on all the subscales, which was statistically significant. No significant difference was noted in the control group. CONCLUSION: Yoga is effective in reducing menopausal symptoms and should be considered as alternative therapy for the management of menopausal symptoms.

21897736	Yoga therapy for developing emotional intelligence in mid-life managers.	BACKGROUND: Business executives' lives have become a never-ending race against time, technology, and targets. This race creates tension, which leads to dissatisfaction and frustration and eventually manifests itself as psychological and physiological stress with mental and emotional drain. This modern lifestyle intensifies the stress leading to "excessive tension" and consequent deterioration in "executive efficiency". OBJECTIVE: To assess emotional intelligent quotient (EQ) in managers undergoing yoga-based Self Management of Excessive Tension (SMET) program. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 72 managers participated in this study which is of "single group pre-post design." The EQ test developed by Prof N. K. Chadha from University of Delhi was administered as pre and post the 5 days of SMET program. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Means, standard deviations, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and Wilcoxon signed rank test were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The data analysis showed 72.02% significant increase (P<0.001) in EQ. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that participation in a SMET program was associated with improvement in EQ and may have implications for "executive efficiency."

21887116	An eight-week yoga intervention is associated with improvements in pain, psychological functioning and mindfulness, and changes in cortisol levels in women with fibromyalgia.	OBJECTIVES: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, depression, and hypocortisolism. To date, published studies have not investigated the effects of yoga on cortisol in FM. This pilot study used a time series design to evaluate pain, psychological variables, mindfulness, and cortisol in women with FM before and after a yoga intervention. METHODS: Participants (n = 22) were recruited from the community to participate in a 75 minute yoga class twice weekly for 8 weeks. Questionnaires concerning pain (intensity, unpleasantness, quality, sum of local areas of pain, catastrophizing, acceptance, disability), anxiety, depression, and mindfulness were administered pre-, mid- and post-intervention. Salivary cortisol samples were collected three times a day for each of two days, pre- and post-intervention. RESULTS: Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that mean +/- standard deviation (SD) scores improved significantly (p < 0.05) from pre- to post-intervention for continuous pain (pre: 5.18 +/- 1.72; post: 4.44 +/- 2.03), pain catastrophizing (pre: 25.33 +/- 14.77; post: 20.40 +/- 17.01), pain acceptance (pre: 60.47 +/- 23.43; post: 65.50 +/- 22.93), and mindfulness (pre: 120.21 +/- 21.80; post: 130.63 +/- 20.82). Intention-to-treat analysis showed that median AUC for post-intervention cortisol (263.69) was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than median AUC for pre-intervention levels (189.46). Mediation analysis revealed that mid-intervention mindfulness scores significantly (p < 0.05) mediated the relationship between pre- and post-intervention pain catastrophizing scores. DISCUSSION: The results suggest that a yoga intervention may reduce pain and catastrophizing, increase acceptance and mindfulness, and alter total cortisol levels in women with FM. The changes in mindfulness and cortisol levels may provide preliminary evidence for mechanisms of a yoga program for women with FM. Future studies should use an RCT design with a larger sample size.

21880079	A mixed-methods evaluation of complementary therapy services in palliative care: yoga and dance therapy.	To inform service provision and future research, we evaluated two complementary therapy services: yoga classes and dance therapy [The Lebed Method (TLM)]. Both were run as 6-week group courses. Patients completed the Measure Yourself Concerns and Wellbeing questionnaire pre- and post-course. Mean change over time was calculated for patient-nominated concern and well-being scores. Qualitative data regarding factors affecting health other than the therapy and benefits of the service were analysed using content analysis. Eighteen patients participated (mean age 63.8 years; 16 female; 14 cancer diagnoses); 10 were doing yoga, five TLM, and three both yoga and TLM; 14 completed more than one assessed course. Patients' most prevalent concerns were: mobility/fitness (n= 20), breathing problems (n= 20), arm, shoulder and neck problems (n= 18), difficulty relaxing (n= 8), back/postural problems (n= 8), fear/anxiety (n= 5). Factors affecting patients' health other than the therapy were prevalent and predominantly negative (e.g. treatment side effects). Patients reported psycho-spiritual, physical and social benefits. Concern scores improved significantly (P < 0.001) for both therapies; improved well-being was clinically significant for yoga. Evaluations of group complementary therapy services are feasible, can be conducted effectively and have implications for future research. Yoga and TLM may be of benefit in this population.

21875352	Lymphedema after breast or gynecological cancer: use and effectiveness of mainstream and complementary therapies.	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to describe the use, as well as perceived effectiveness, of mainstream and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies in the treatment of lymphedema following breast or gynecological cancer. Further, the study assessed the relationship between the characteristics of lymphedema (including type, severity, stability, and duration), and the use of CAM and/or mainstream treatment. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study using a convenience sample of women with lymphedema following breast and gynecological cancers. A self-administered questionnaire was sent to 247 potentially eligible women. Of those returned (50%), 23 were ineligible and 6 were excluded due to level of missing data. RESULTS: In the previous 12 months, the majority of women (90%) had used mainstream treatments to treat their lymphedema, with massage being the most commonly used (86%). One (1) in 2 women had used CAM to treat their lymphedema, and 98% of those using CAM were also using mainstream treatments. Over 27 types of CAM were reported, with use of a chi machine, vitamin E supplements, yoga, and meditation being the most commonly reported forms. The perceived effectiveness ratings (1-7 with 7=completely effective) of mainstream (mean+/-standard deviation (SD): 5.3+/-1.5) and CAM therapies (mean+/-SD: 5.2+1.6) were considered high. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that mainstream and CAM treatment use is common, varied, and considered to be effective among women with lymphedema following breast or gynecological cancer. Furthermore, it highlights the immediate need for larger prospective studies assessing the inter-relationship between the use of mainstream and CAM therapies for treatment success.

21868714	Application of yoga in residential treatment of traumatized youth.	BACKGROUND: The Trauma Center at Justice Resource Institute has adapted a form of Hatha yoga into a trauma-sensitive adjunctive component of intervention for use with complexly traumatized individuals exhibiting chronic affective and somatic dysregulation and associated behavioral, functioning, and health complaints. OBJECTIVES: This article explores the use of yoga with traumatized youth (aged 12-21 years) in residential treatment. DESIGN: A review of the literature on the somatic impact of trauma exposure provides a rationale for the use of yoga with this population and highlights an emerging evidence base in support of this practice. Case vignettes illustrate the integration of structured, gentle yoga practices into residential programming for youth with severe emotional and behavioral problems. RESULTS: Anecdotal data and clinical observation underscore the promise of yoga as a viable approach to build self-regulatory capacity of traumatized youth. CONCLUSIONS: Future directions in the development and evaluation of trauma-informed yoga practices for youth are discussed.

21853784	Effects of high-frequency yoga breathing called kapalabhati compared with breath awareness on the degree of optical illusion perceived.	Prior research has shown that methods of meditation, breath control, and different kinds of yoga breathing affect attention and visual perception, including decreasing the size of certain optical illusions. Evaluating relationships sheds light on the perceptual and cognitive changes induced by yoga and related methods, and the locus of the effects. In the present study, the degree of optical illusion was assessed using Muller-Lyer stimuli before and immediately after two different kinds of practice, a high frequency yoga breathing called kapalabhati, and breath awareness. A nonyoga, control session tested for practice effects. Thirty participants (with group M age = 26.9 yr., SD = 5.7) practiced the two techniques for 18 min. on two separate days. The control group had 15 nonyoga practitioners assessed before and after 18 min. in which they did not perform any specific activity but were seated and relaxed. After both kapalabhati and breath awareness there was a significant decrease in the degree of optical illusion. The possibility that this was due to a practice or repetition effect was ruled out when 15 nonyoga practitioners showed no change in the degree of illusion when retested after 18 min. The changes were interpreted as due to changes in perception related to the way the stimuli were judged.	Telles, Shirley;Maharana, Kanchan;Balrana, Budhi;Balkrishna, Acharya	2011 Jun
21852486	Interventions shown to aid executive function development in children 4 to 12 years old.	To be successful takes creativity, flexibility, self-control, and discipline. Central to all those are executive functions, including mentally playing with ideas, giving a considered rather than an impulsive response, and staying focused. Diverse activities have been shown to improve children's executive functions: computerized training, noncomputerized games, aerobics, martial arts, yoga, mindfulness, and school curricula. All successful programs involve repeated practice and progressively increase the challenge to executive functions. Children with worse executive functions benefit most from these activities; thus, early executive-function training may avert widening achievement gaps later. To improve executive functions, focusing narrowly on them may not be as effective as also addressing emotional and social development (as do curricula that improve executive functions) and physical development (shown by positive effects of aerobics, martial arts, and yoga).

21849414	Acute effects of aerobic exercise and Hatha yoga on craving to smoke.	INTRODUCTION: Recent studies have examined the effects of physical activity on craving to smoke and smoking withdrawal. The current study was designed to compare and contrast the effects of 2 different forms of physical activity on general and cue-elicited craving to smoke. METHODS: Following 1-hr nicotine abstinence, 76 daily smokers were randomly assigned to engage in a 30-min bout of cardiovascular exercise (CE; brisk walk on a treadmill), Hatha yoga (HY), or a nonactivity control condition. Participants completed measures of craving and mood, and a smoking cue reactivity assessment, before, immediately following, and approximately 20 min after the physical activity or control conditions. RESULTS: Compared with the control condition, participants in each of the physical activity groups reported a decrease in craving to smoke, an increase in positive affect, and a decrease in negative affect. In addition, craving in response to smoking cues was specifically reduced among those who engaged in CE, whereas those who engaged in HY reported a general decrease in cravings. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides further support for the use of exercise bouts for attenuating cigarette cravings during temporary nicotine abstinence. Results also suggest that CE can attenuate cravings in response to smoking cues. There are several areas for further research that may improve integration of exercise within smoking cessation treatment.	Elibero, Andrea;Janse Van Rensburg, Kate;Drobes, David J	2011 Nov
21845555	[Body-directed techniques on psychomotor therapy for people with schizophrenia: a review of the literature].	BACKGROUND: Patients with schizophrenia frequently undergo a disturbance of body experience. This can occur during an acute psychotic phase or during a period of remission. AIM: To investigate the scientific evidence of the effects of introducing body-directed techniques into psychomotor therapy for patients with schizophrenia. METHOD: PubMed, PEDro, CINAHL, psycINFO and SPORTDiscus were searched form 1 January, 2000, tot 1 January 2011, for reports of randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials and for studies wit a different design. The Tijdschrift voor Psychiatrie (the Dutch Journal of Psychiatry), the Tijdschrift voor Vaktherapie (The Journal for Special therapies) and Actuele Themata (Actual Themes) in psychomotor therapy were also screened. The quality of the methodology was assessed with the help of a checklist. Evidence for the efficacy of the interventions was summarised on the basis of a best-evidence synthesis. RESULT: Eleven studies satisfied our inclusion and exclusion criteria. There was a strong evidence for the reduction of psychiatric symptoms after yoga and reduced feelings of anxiety and stress after progressive muscle relaxation. There is limited evidence for yoga in reducing feelings of anxiety and stress and for body-directed group techniques in reducing negative symptoms. Qualitative research reported that mindfulness - and massage-techniques were able to considerably reduce feelings of stress. There is no evidence for the beneficial effects of dancing techniques. CONCLUSION: A body-directed approach can be effective an deserves to be included in the multidisciplinary treatment of schizophrenia.

21842622	That community becomes you? An examination of community differences in self-objectification and related variables.	The authors surveyed women from 2 communities: Anchorage, Alaska (N =51), an urban area, and Haines, Alaska (N=41), an isolated rural community. Participants from Haines scored lower on measures of self-objectification, internalization of sociocultural attitudes toward appearance, participation in beauty enhancement behaviors, and perceived normative beauty enhancement behaviors. Women from Haines also engaged in more empowering exercise (i.e., yoga and outdoor exercise). Internalization of sociocultural attitudes toward appearance mediated the relation between perceived normative beauty enhancement behaviors and self-objectification for women living in both communities. The current study suggests that communities may present opportunities to engage in activities that influence one's predisposition to self-objectify. The nonexperimental nature of this study, however, prevents the definitive establishment of the direction of causality between variables.

21840326	Retinal microvasculature measurements in full-term newborn infants.	OBJECTIVE: Currently, there are no published data on retinal microvasculature size in human infants born at term. The purpose of this study was to determine the normal retinal microvasculature measurements in human infants born at term with normal birth weight and to compare these results with measurements in children and adults. METHODS: Retinal arteriole and venule measurements were obtained in a cohort of 20 full-term infants. Digital retinal images were obtained from both eyes after pupillary dilation using a digital retinal camera. Measurements of vessel diameter were then obtained using semi-automated software. RESULTS: Twenty infants (9 female infants and 11 male infants) were analyzed. The retinal arteriole diameter was 66.8-123.0 mum (mean, 85.5 (14.3) mum), and the venule diameter was 102.0-167.8 mum (mean, 130.0 (16.0) mum). There were no differences in the arterial or venule diameters between the male and female infants (83.2 (12.2) vs. 88.3 (16.9); P=0.4372; 124.3 (16.0) vs. 137.0 (18.0); P=0.08). The arteriovenous ratio was found to be 0.66 (95% CI 0.62-0.71). The coefficient of correlation between the retinal arterioles and venules was 0.56. The retinal arteriole and venule diameters increase as a person matures. The arteriovenous ratio also increases with age. CONCLUSION: In newborn infants, retinal venules are significantly larger than retinal arterioles. The arteriovenous ratio is smaller in neonates compared to adults indicating the retinal arteriole diameter increases at a different pace compared to retinal venule. Sex does not influence the retinal microvasculature size in infants. The presence of spontaneous retinal hemorrhage and the inability to account for refractive errors were the main limitations of this study.	Kandasamy, Yogavijayan;Smith, Roger;Wright, Ian M R	2011 Nov
21836105	Effect of 3-month yoga on oxidative stress in type 2 diabetes with or without complications: a controlled clinical trial.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of yoga on anthropometry, blood pressure, glycemic control, and oxidative stress in type 2 diabetic patients on standard care in comparison with standard care alone. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study involved 123 patients stratified according to groups with microvascular complications, macrovascular complications, and peripheral neuropathy and without complications and assigned to receive either standard care or standard care along with additional yoga for 3 months. RESULTS: In comparison with standard care alone, yoga resulted in significant reduction in BMI, glycemic control, and malondialdehyde and increase in glutathione and vitamin C. There were no differences in waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure, vitamin E, or superoxide dismutase in the yoga group at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga can be used as an effective therapy in reducing oxidative stress in type 2 diabetes. Yoga in addition to standard care helps reduce BMI and improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients.

21824591	Complementary and alternative treatment for neck pain: chiropractic, acupuncture, TENS, massage, yoga, Tai Chi, and Feldenkrais.	Of the multitude of treatment options for the management of neck pain, no obvious single treatment modality has been shown to be most efficacious. As such, the clinician should consider alternative treatment modalities if a modality is engaging, available, financially feasible, potentially efficacious, and is low risk for the patient. As evidence-based medicine for neck pain develops, the clinician is faced with the challenge of which treatments to encourage patients to pursue. Treatment modalities explored in this article, including chiropractic, acupuncture, TENS, massage, yoga, Tai Chi, and Feldenkrais, represent reasonable complementary and alternative medicine methods for patients with neck pain.

21808936	Dietary intakes and antioxidant status in mind-body exercising pre- and postmenopausal women.	OBJECTIVE: The decline in antioxidant defenses due to both estrogen loss and frequent adoption of poor dietary choices exposes postmenopausal women to cardiovascular diseases. Adequate nutrition and physical exercise are two factors of health promotion. This study investigated whether regular practice of mind-body exercise (yoga and/or tai chi) alters dietary intake and antioxidant status and balances the menopause-related increases in lipid peroxidation and cardiovascular risk. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: The study was conducted in an urban community in Bangkok (Thailand) between May and August 2007. PARTICIPANTS: Premenopausal (Pre M; 39+/-8 yrs; n=56) and postmenopausal (Post M; 54+/-5 yrs; n=39) women who had been practicing yoga (Y) and/or tai chi (TC) more than 3 hours/week for a year, or who had no regular physical activity practice (sedentary, S). MEASUREMENTS: All participants completed food frequency questionnaires and 4-day food and activity records. Blood was collected on day 5. Factorial ANOVA tests were performed according to menopause status, exercise, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) groups. RESULTS: Post M had higher (p = 0.01) dietary fiber intake compared with Pre M. Yoga practitioners had lower BMI (p = 0.004) and lower fat intake (p = 0.02) compared with their S and TC counterparts. Plasma total antioxidant status was significantly and independently lower and higher in Y and Post M groups, respectively. However, no difference was shown after adjusting for BMI. Regardless of menopause status and HRT, the activity of erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase - an aerobic training-responsive enzyme - was higher (p < 0.001) in TC practitioners compared with other groups. No effects were shown on erythrocyte superoxide dismutase activity, plasma lipid peroxidation (TBARS) or total homocysteine concentrations. CONCLUSION: Yoga and tai chi exercises can be used as components of a strategy to promote healthy lifestyles (balanced diet and moderate intensity exercise) in vulnerable populations, such as menopausal women, in order to prevent aging induced oxidative stress-related diseases.

21800407	The suitability of yoga as a potential therapeutic intervention for rheumatoid arthritis: a focus group approach.	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the views of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) regarding the suitability of yoga as a potential therapeutic intervention in the management of RA. METHODS: Twenty-two participants with RA were recruited from outpatient clinics at a regional hospital in New Zealand and divided into four focus groups. Heterogeneity between groups in terms of age, gender, duration of RA and functional ability provided opinions from a cross-section of RA patients. Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis, with four themes predominating. RESULTS: Firstly, participants described their experience of symptoms related to their RA in three independent but linked categories of physical, mental and social well-being. Secondly, participants perceived the management of their RA to be prescriptive, medicalized and failing to address their wider health concerns. Thirdly, participants perceived yoga as a safe, adaptable therapy that may allow self-management of their RA. However, there was some concern that functional limitations may inhibit ability to practise the physical aspects of yoga. Fourthly, requirements for a yoga intervention that would be feasible for people with RA were presented by participants. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with RA perceive a disparity between their personal experience of living with RA and their current medical management. Yoga is perceived as a potential therapy to address this disparity. Based on opinions expressed by participants, future research regarding a yoga intervention as an adjunctive therapy for managing RA should meet patients' views on feasibility and test outcome measures reflecting the domains of physical, mental and social well-being.

21799675	Hatha yoga practices: energy expenditure, respiratory changes and intensity of exercise.	The aim of this study was to critically observe the energy expenditure, exercise intensity and respiratory changes during a full yoga practice session. Oxygen consumption ([Formula: see text]), carbon dioxide output ([Formula: see text]), pulmonary ventilation ([Formula: see text]E), respiratory rate (Fr) and tidal volume (VT), were measured in 16 physical posture (asanas), five yoga breathing maneuvers (BM) and two types of meditation. Twenty male (age 27.3 +/- 3.5 years, height 166.6 +/- 5.4 cm and body weight 58.8 +/- 9.6 kg) yoga instructors were studied. Their maximal oxygen consumption ([Formula: see text]) was recorded. The exercise intensity in asanas was expressed in percentage [Formula: see text] . In asanas, exercise intensity varied from 9.9 to 26.5% of [Formula: see text] . Highest energy cost was 3.02 kcal min(-1). In BM highest [Formula: see text]E was 53.7 +/- 15.5 l min(-1). VT was 0.97 +/- 0.59, 1.41 +/- 1.27 and 1.28 +/- l/breath with corresponding Fr of 14.0 +/- 5.3, 10.0 +/- 6.35, 10.0 +/- 5.8 breaths/min. Average energy expenditure in asanas, BM and meditation were 2.29, 1.91 and 1.37 kcal min(-1), respectively. Metabolic rate was generally in the range of 1-2 metabolic equivalents (MET) except in three asanas where it was >2 MET. [Formula: see text] was 0.27 +/- 0.05 and 0.24 +/- 0.04 l min(-1) in meditation and Shavasana, respectively. Although yogic practices are low intensity exercises within lactate threshold, physical performance improvement is possible owing to both better economy of breathing by BM and also by improvement in cardiovascular reserve. Other factors such as psycho-physiological and better relaxation may contribute to it.	Ray, Uday Sankar;Pathak, Anjana;Tomer, Omveer Singh	2011
21780737	Yoga to treat nonspecific low back pain.	Low back pain is common and poses a challenge for clinicians to find effective treatment to prevent it from becoming chronic. Chronic low back pain can have a significant impact on an employee's ability to remain an active and productive member of the work force due to increased absenteeism, duty restrictions, or physical limitations from pain. Low back pain is the most common cause of work-related disability among employees younger than 46 years. Advancing technology and less invasive surgical procedures have not improved outcomes for employees who suffer from low back pain. Most continue to experience some pain and dysfunction after conventional treatments such as injections and surgery. An alternative treatment that could reduce nonspecific chronic low back pain would benefit both employees and employers. Exercising and remaining active are part of most guidelines' routine care recommendations but are not well defined.	Carter, Catherine;Stratton, Carol;Mallory, Debra	2011 Aug
21780687	[A comparison of rate human lipid profile changes at moderate altitude].	The paper studies antiatherogenic changes of serum lipid profile in various conditions, namely: 1) the mountain and climatic treatment on Caucasian resorts, 2) periodic hypobaric therapy, 3) trekking in mountains with regular cold tests (the Tibetan yoga gTum-mo). We made the comparison of rate of change of serum total cholesterol, high (HDL), low (LDL) and very low density (VLDL) lipoproteins, and also triglycerides by use of exponential model of changes of lipid profile. By application of new computing algorithm it was proved that the maximal rate of antiatherogenic changes of serum lipid profile (decrease in the total cholesterol and in LDL, increase in HDL) is characteristic for a combination of three conditions: 1) moderate altitude hypoxia, 2) moderate physical activities and 3) special exercises for increase of cold tolerance (the Tibetan yoga gTum-mo).

21773016	The metabolic syndrome and mind-body therapies: a systematic review.	The metabolic syndrome, affecting a substantial and increasing percentage of the worldwide population, is comprised of a cluster of symptoms associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic conditions. Mind-body modalities based on Eastern philosophy, such as yoga, tai chi, qigong, and meditation, have become increasingly popular worldwide. These complementary therapies have many reported benefits for improving symptoms and physiological measures associated with the metabolic syndrome. However, clinical trial data concerning the effectiveness of these practices on the syndrome as a whole have not been evaluated using a systematic and synthesizing approach. A systematic review was conducted to critically evaluate the data from clinical trials examining the efficacy of mind-body therapies as supportive care modalities for management of the metabolic syndrome. Three clinical trials addressing the use of mind-body therapies for management of the metabolic syndrome were identified. Findings from the studies reviewed support the potential clinical effectiveness of mind-body practices in improving indices of the metabolic syndrome.	Anderson, Joel G;Taylor, Ann Gill	2011
21771894	Physical activity and cognition in women with vascular conditions.	BACKGROUND: Individuals with vascular disease or risk factors have substantially higher rates of cognitive decline, yet little is known about means of maintaining cognition in this group. METHODS: We examined the relation between physical activity and cognitive decline in participants of the Women's Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study, a cohort of women with prevalent vascular disease or at least 3 coronary risk factors. Recreational physical activity was assessed at baseline (October 1995 through June 1996) and every 2 years thereafter. Between December 1998 and July 2000, a total of 2809 women 65 years or older underwent a cognitive battery by telephone interview, including 5 tests of global cognition, verbal memory, and category fluency. Tests were administered 3 additional times over 5.4 years. We used multivariable-adjusted general linear models for repeated measures to compare the annual rates of cognitive score changes across levels of total physical activity and energy expended in walking, as assessed at Women's Antioxidant Cardiovascular Study baseline. RESULTS: We found a significant trend (P < .001 for trend) toward decreasing rates of cognitive decline with increasing energy expenditure. Compared with the bottom quintile of total physical activity, significant differences in rates of cognitive decline were observed from the fourth quintile (P = .04 for the fourth quintile and P < .001 for the fifth quintile), or the equivalent of daily 30-minute walks at a brisk pace. This was equivalent to the difference in cognitive decline observed for women who were 5 to 7 years younger. Regularly walking for exercise was strongly related to slower rates of cognitive decline (P = .003 for trend). CONCLUSION: Regular physical activity, including walking, was associated with better preservation of cognitive function in older women with vascular disease or risk factors.

21771340	Effect of an office worksite-based yoga program on heart rate variability: a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Chronic work-related stress is a significant and independent risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and associated mortality, particularly when compounded by a sedentary work environment. Heart rate variability (HRV) provides an estimate of parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic control, and can serve as a marker of physiological stress. Hatha yoga is a physically demanding practice that can help to reduce stress; however, time constraints incurred by work and family life may limit participation. The purpose of the present study is to determine if a 10-week, worksite-based yoga program delivered during lunch hour can improve resting HRV and related physical and psychological parameters in sedentary office workers. METHODS AND DESIGN: This is a parallel-arm RCT that will compare the outcomes of participants assigned to the experimental treatment group (yoga) to those assigned to a no-treatment control group. Participants randomized to the experimental condition will engage in a 10-week yoga program delivered at their place of work. The yoga sessions will be group-based, prescribed three times per week during lunch hour, and will be led by an experienced yoga instructor. The program will involve teaching beginner students safely and progressively over 10 weeks a yoga sequence that incorporates asanas (poses and postures), vinyasa (exercises), pranayama (breathing control) and meditation. The primary outcome of this study is the high frequency (HF) spectral power component of HRV (measured in absolute units; i.e. ms2), a measure of parasympathetic autonomic control. Secondary outcomes include additional frequency and time domains of HRV, and measures of physical functioning and psychological health status. Measures will be collected prior to and following the intervention period, and at 6 months follow-up to determine the effect of intervention withdrawal. DISCUSSION: This study will determine the effect of worksite-based yoga practice on HRV and physical and psychological health status. The findings may assist in implementing practical interventions, such as yoga, into the workplace to mitigate stress, enhance health status and reduce the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.

21760694	Clinical efficacy of herbal Padmapatradi yoga in bronchial asthma (Tamaka Swasa).	Ayurveda refers to bronchial asthma as Tamaka Swasa and it is well explained in Charaka Samhita. It contributes several modalities of the treatment for Swasa roga(asthma). Among all modalities of treatment, polyherbal combinations are said to be well-accepted, safe and effective in asthma. A study was carried out in 40 patients of either sex in between the age of 15-65 years to assure the clinical response of Padmapatradi yoga in bronchial asthma (Tamaka Swasa) at P.G. department of Kayachikitsa, D.G.M. Ayurvedic Medical College, Gadag, Karnataka. The sum total properties of Padmapatradi yoga is tikta katu rasa, laghu and tikna guna (light and penetrating properties), ushna virya (hot potency) and vatakaphagna (decrease vata and kapha dosa) Padmapatradi yoga is effective in increased peak expiratory flow rate, breath holding time, and reduces the absolute eosinophil count of studied cases and also found statistically highly significant at p<0.001 level. The drug is quite safe and acts as a bronchodilator, antihistaminic and anti-inflammatory.	Panda, Ashok Kumar;Doddanagali, S R	2011 Apr

21742277	The impact of yoga upon female patients suffering from hypothyroidism.	OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of yoga on the quality of life of female hypothyroid patients. DESIGN: The WHO Quality of Life Scale(22) was used to assess the quality of life of 20 female hypothyroid patients. Subjects attended one hour yoga sessions daily for a period of one month. A pretest-post-test research design was used for data analysis. RESULTS: Patients' quality of life scores following the yoga program were greater than scores obtained prior to undertaking yoga (p < 0.01). Patients also reported significant improvement in their perception of the overall quality of life and of their health post yoga intervention. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that yoga is valuable in helping the hypothyroid patients to manage their disease-related symptoms. Yoga may be considered as supportive or complementary therapy in conjunction with medical therapy for the treatment of hypothyroid disorder.

21735413	Mind-body interventions during pregnancy for preventing or treating women's anxiety.	BACKGROUND: Anxiety during pregnancy is a common problem. Anxiety and stress could have consequences on the course of the pregnancy and the later development of the child. Anxiety responds well to treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy and/or medication. Non-pharmacological interventions such as mind-body interventions, known to decrease anxiety in several clinical situations, might be offered for treating and preventing anxiety during pregnancy. OBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits of mind-body interventions during pregnancy in preventing or treating women's anxiety and in influencing perinatal outcomes. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 November 2010), MEDLINE (1950 to 30 November 2010), EMBASE (1974 to 30 November 2010), the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) (1 December 2010), ClinicalTrials.gov (December 2010) and Current Controlled Trials (1 December 2010), searched the reference lists of selected studies and contacted professionals and authors in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials, involving pregnant women of any age at any time from conception to one month after birth, comparing mind-body interventions with a control group. Mind-body interventions include: autogenic training, biofeedback, hypnotherapy, imagery, meditation, prayer, auto-suggestion, tai-chi and yoga. Control group includes: standard care, other pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions, other types of mind-body interventions or no treatment at all. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion all assessed risk of bias for each included study. We extracted data independently using an agreed form and checked it for accuracy. MAIN RESULTS: We included eight trials (556 participants), evaluating hypnotherapy (one trial), imagery (five trials), autogenic training (one trial) and yoga (one trial). Due to the small number of studies per intervention and to the diversity of outcome measurements, we performed no meta-analysis, and have reported results individually for each study. Compared with usual care, in one study (133 women), imagery may have a positive effect on anxiety during labor decreasing anxiety at the early and middle stages of labor (MD -1.46; 95% CI -2.43 to -0.49; one study, 133 women) and (MD -1.24; 95% CI -2.18 to -0.30). Another study showed that imagery had a positive effect on anxiety and depression in the immediate postpartum period. Autogenic training might be effective for decreasing women's anxiety before delivering. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Mind-body interventions might benefit women's anxiety during pregnancy. Based on individual studies, there is some but no strong evidence for the effectiveness of mind-body interventions for the management of anxiety during pregnancy. The main limitations of the studies were the lack of blinding and insufficient details on the methods used for randomization.

21733988	Impact of yoga on functional outcomes in breast cancer survivors with aromatase inhibitor-associated arthralgias.	Arthralgia affects postmenopausal breast cancer survivors (BCSs) receiving aromatase inhibitors (AIs). This study aims to establish the feasibility of studying the impact of yoga on objective functional outcomes, pain, and health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) for AI-associated arthralgia (AIAA). Postmenopausal women with stage I to III breast cancer who reported AIAA were enrolled in a single-arm pilot trial. A yoga program was provided twice a week for 8 weeks. The Functional Reach (FR) and Sit and Reach (SR) were evaluated as primary outcomes. Pain, as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), self-reported Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS), and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) were secondary outcomes. Paired t tests were used for analysis, and 90% provided data for assessment at the end of the intervention. Participants experienced significant improvement in balance, as measured by FR, and flexibility, as measured by SR. The PSFS improved from 4.55 to 7.21, and HR-QOL measured by FACT-B also improved; both P < .05. The score for the Pain Severity subscale of the BPI reduced. No adverse events nor development or worsening of lymphedema was observed. In all, 80% of participants adhered to the home program. Preliminary data suggest that yoga may reduce pain and improve balance and flexibility in BCSs with AIAA. A randomized controlled trial is needed to establish the definitive efficacy of yoga for objective functional improvement in BCSs related to AIAA.

21725900	Exercise therapy for fibromyalgia.	Fibromyalgia syndrome, a chronic condition typically characterized by widespread pain, nonrestorative sleep, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and other somatic symptoms, negatively impacts physical and emotional function and reduces quality of life. Exercise is commonly recommended in the management of people with fibromyalgia, and interest in examining exercise benefits for those with the syndrome has grown substantially over the past 25 years. Research supports aerobic and strength training to improve physical fitness and function, reduce fibromyalgia symptoms, and improve quality of life. However, other forms of exercise (e.g., tai chi, yoga, Nordic walking, vibration techniques) and lifestyle physical activity also have been investigated to determine their effects. This paper highlights findings from recent randomized controlled trials and reviews of exercise for people with fibromyalgia, and includes information regarding factors that influence response and adherence to exercise to assist clinicians with exercise and physical activity prescription decision-making to optimize health and well-being.

21716773	Yoga and menopausal transition.	With increased life expectancy, today, women spend one-third of their life after menopause. Thus more attention is needed towards peri- and post-menopausal symptoms. Estrogen replacement therapy is the most effective treatment, however, it has its own limitations. The present need is to explore new options for the management of menopausal symptoms. Yogic life style is a way of living which aims to improve the body, mind and day to day life of individuals. The most commonly performed Yoga practices are postures (asana), controlled breathing (pranayama), and meditation (dhyana). Yoga has been utilized as a therapeutic tool to achieve positive health and control and cure diseases. The exact mechanism as to how Yoga helps in various disease states is not known. There could be neuro-hormonal pathways with a selective effect in each pathological situation. There have been multiple studies that have combined the many aspects of Yoga into a general Yoga session in order to investigate its effects on menopausal symptoms. Integrated approach of Yoga therapy can improve hot flushes and night sweats. There is increasing evidence suggesting that even the short-term practice of Yoga can decrease both psychological and physiological risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Studies conclude that our age old therapy, Yoga, is fairly effective in managing menopausal symptoms.	Vaze, Nirmala;Joshi, Sulabha	2010 Jul
21716708	A randomized, controlled trial of meditation for work stress, anxiety and depressed mood in full-time workers.	Objective. To assess the effect of meditation on work stress, anxiety and mood in full-time workers. Methods. 178 adult workers participated in an 8-week, 3-arm randomized controlled trial comparing a "mental silence" approach to meditation (n = 59) to a "relaxation" active control (n = 56) and a wait-list control (n = 63). Participants were assessed before and after using Psychological Strain Questionnaire (PSQ), a subscale of the larger Occupational Stress Inventory (OSI), the State component of the State/Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults (STAI), and the depression-dejection (DD) subscale of the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Results. There was a significant improvement for the meditation group compared to both the relaxation control and the wait-list groups the PSQ (P = .026), and DD (P = .019). Conclusions. Mental silence-orientated meditation, in this case Sahaja Yoga meditation, is a safe and effective strategy for dealing with work stress and depressive feelings. The findings suggest that "thought reduction" or "mental silence" may have specific effects relevant to work stress and hence occupational health.	Manocha, R;Black, D;Sarris, J;Stough, C	2011
23271863	Six-month trial of Yoga Nidra in menstrual disorder patients: Effects on somatoform symptoms.	BACKGROUND: Yoga Nidra is a successful therapy for both recent and long-standing psychological disturbances of all kinds especially depression and high anxiety level and neurotic patterns. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present work, therefore, was to conduct a preliminary randomized study of Yoga Nidra as a treatment in the patients of menstrual disorders with somatoform symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were recruited from Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, CSM Medical University (erstwhile KGMU) Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. One hundred and fifty female patients with menstrual disorders were randomly divided in to two groups 1- Intervention group: 75 subjects (Yoga Nidra intervention and medication) 2- control group: 75 subjects (without Yoga Nidra intervention only medication). Schedule for clinical assessment in neuropsychiatry tool was used. RESULTS: There was significant improvement in pain symptoms (P<0.006), gastrointestinal symptoms (P<0.04), cardiovascular symptoms (P<0.02) and urogenital symptoms (P<0.005) after 6 months of Yoga Nidra therapy in Intervention group in comparison to control group. CONCLUSION: Yoga Nidra appears to be a promising intervention for psychosomatic problems. It is cost-effective and easy to implement. The results indicate that somatoform symptoms in patients with menstrual disorder can be decreased by learning and applying a program based on Yogic intervention (Yoga Nidra).

21711202	Yoga therapy as an adjunctive treatment for schizophrenia: a randomized, controlled pilot study.	OBJECTIVES: There has been limited study of therapeutic yoga as a complementary treatment for schizophrenia. This study investigates the effects of a Yoga Therapy program on symptomatology and quality of life in adults with schizophrenia in a state psychiatric facility. METHODS: In a randomized, controlled pilot study, 18 clinically stable patients (12 men and 6 women) with schizophrenia (mean age=42+/-13.5) were randomized to an 8-week Yoga Therapy program (YT) and a Waitlist group (WL). YT intervention included yoga postures, breathing exercises, and relaxation. At baseline and at 8 weeks, symptomatology was measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Secondary efficacy outcomes were measured with the World Health Organization Quality of Life BREF questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF). RESULTS: The YT group obtained significant improvements in positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia symptoms compared to WL, including PANSS scores on positive syndrome (t=-2.64, p=0.02), negative syndrome (t=-3.04, p<0.01), general psychopathology (t=-3.74, p<0.00), activation (t=-2.29, p<0.04), paranoia (t=-2.89, p<0.01), and depression subscales (t=-2.62, p<0.02). PANSS total scores also decreased for the YT group (t=-4.54, p<0.00). YT had improved perceived quality of life in physical (t=2.38, p<0.04) and psychologic domains (t=2.88, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Adults with schizophrenia being treated in a state psychiatric facility who participated in an 8-week therapeutic yoga program showed significant improvements in psychopathology and quality of life compared with controls. The findings of this study need to be confirmed in larger, more sufficiently powered studies with active control groups.	Visceglia, Elizabeth;Lewis, Stephen	2011 Jul
21704783	Aerobic exercise to improve cognitive function in adults with neurological disorders: a systematic review.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether aerobic exercise improves cognition in adults diagnosed with neurologic disorders. DATA SOURCES: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed, EMBASE, PEDro, AMED, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, ERIC, and Google Scholar, with the last search performed in December 2010. STUDY SELECTION: We included controlled clinical trials and randomized controlled trials with adults diagnosed with a neurologic disorder. Studies were included if they compared a control group with a group involved in an aerobic exercise program to improve cardiorespiratory fitness and if they measured cognition as an outcome. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently extracted data and methodologic quality of the included trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: From the 67 trials reviewed, a total of 7 trials, involving 249 participants, were included. Two trials compared the effectiveness of yoga and aerobic exercise in adults with multiple sclerosis. Two trials evaluated the effect of exercise on patients with dementia, and 2 trials evaluated the effectiveness of exercise to improve cognition after traumatic brain injury. One trial studied the effect of a cycling program in people with chronic stroke. Lack of commonality between measures of cognition limited meta-analyses. Results from individual studies show that aerobic exercise improved cognition in people with dementia, improved attention and cognitive flexibility in patients with traumatic brain injury, improved choice reaction time in people with multiple sclerosis, and enhanced motor learning in people with chronic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence to support the use of aerobic exercise to improve cognition in adults with neurologic disorders. Of the 67 studies retrieved, less than half included cognition as an outcome, and few studies continued the aerobic exercise program long enough to be considered effective. Further studies investigating the effect of aerobic exercise interventions on cognition in people with neurologic conditions are required.

21699511	Stress and quality of life in psoriasis: an update.	Psoriasis is a chronic, relapsing, cutaneous condition with 1-2% prevalence in the general population. There are many factors involved in the induction and/or exacerbation of psoriasis of which stress is a well-known trigger factor in the appearance or exacerbation of psoriasis. Stress reaction in patients with psoriasis is probably mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal relationship with immunologic effects. Stress response involves increased levels of neuroendocrine hormones and autonomic neurotransmitters. Psychological stress or an abnormal response to stressors has been found to modify the evolution of skin disorders such as psoriasis. It can also have substantial psychological, and psychosocial impact on a patient's quality of life. Treatment regimens include stress-reduction strategies, such as biofeedback, meditation, yoga, and self-help approaches. This review focuses the relationship between psoriasis and stress, especially relating to psychosocial, psychological, and emotional stress aspects.

21665111	Acute effects of Surya Namaskar on the cardiovascular & metabolic system.	UNLABELLED: With the recent rise in obesity awareness and the increased understanding of the importance of physical activity in promoting overall health, greater emphasis has been placed on improving physical fitness to enhance quality of life. Surya Namaskar, a component of Hatha Yoga, has been practiced by Asian Indians for hundreds of years and is often used in place of a typical fitness program. It consists of a series of postures (asanas) that are repeated 12 times per round. Only one published study has looked specifically at Surya Namaskar, measuring the energy cost of individual asanas (Sinha et al., 2004). However, practitioners typically perform several rounds of the asanas during a session. PURPOSE: To assess the cardiorespiratory and metabolic responses of four rounds of Surya Namaskar, a typical amount performed by practitioners, to determine its potential as a training and weight loss tool. METHODS: Six healthy Asian Indian men and women (18-22 years) who had trained in Surya Namaskar for over two years participated in the study. Testing was completed in a single session lasting about 30 min. To measure heart rate and oxygen consumption while performing the four rounds, participants were connected to a heart rate monitor and the Oxycon Mobile Metabolic System. RESULTS: Participants exercised at 80% of age-predicted maximal heart rate (HRmax) during Round 2, 84% during Round 3, and 90% during Round 4. Average intensity during the four rounds was 80% HRmax, sufficient to elicit a cardiorespiratory training effect. Oxygen consumption averaged 26 ml/kg/min during each round, resulting in an energy expenditure of 230 kcals during a 30 min session for a 60 kg individual. CONCLUSION: Regular practice of Surya Namaskar may maintain or improve cardiorespiratory fitness, as well as promote weight management.	Mody, Bhavesh Surendra	2011 Jul
21664054	A theoretical model of efficacy of concentrative meditation for cognitive rehabilitation of dementia.	The positive effects of various types of meditation on health have been one of the well documented evidences of past decade. However, the effects of meditation on one specific domain of human cognition-attention have been understudied. This becomes an especially important issue in cases of dementia, where attention deterioration is an important component in addition to the memory problems. Here we appraise some theories of attention deterioration in aging individuals. We next proceed to build a model of the effects of concentrative meditation practice on various domains of attention in aging individuals, backed up with the evidences from literature. For this we also present the results of our own studies conducted on the concentrative meditation of Vihangam Yoga to highlight the fact that with long-term meditation practice, attention can be improved in various domains. Finally we propose that the effects of meditation can be especially tried on minimal cognitive deficit patients to explore if it helps further deterioration in such patients. This line of study could have important implication for future treatments of attention related problems in dementia patients.	Hu, Xiquan;Chang, Feng;Prakash, Ravi;Chaudhury, Suprakash	2011 Aug
21663610	A process evaluation of a worksite vitality intervention among ageing hospital workers.	BACKGROUND: The process evaluation of the Vital@Work intervention was primary aimed at gaining insight into the context, dose delivered, fidelity, reach, dose received, and participants' attitude. Further, the differences between intervention locations were evaluated. METHODS: Eligible for this study were 730 workers, aged >/= 45 years, from two academic hospitals. Workers randomised to the intervention group (n = 367) received a 6-months intervention consisting a Vitality Exercise Programme (VEP) combined with three visits to a Personal Vitality Coach (PVC), aimed at goal setting, feedback, and problem solving. The VEP consisted of a guided yoga session, a guided workout session, and aerobic exercising without direct face-to-face instruction, all once a week. Data were collected by means of a questionnaire after the intervention, attendance registration forms (i.e. attendance at guided VEP group sessions), and coaching registration forms (filled in by the PVCs). RESULTS: The dose delivered of the yoga and workout sessions were 72.3% and 96.3%. All PVC visits (100%) were offered. The reach for the yoga sessions, workout sessions and PVC visits was 70.6%, 63.8%, and 89.6%, respectively. When taken these three intervention components together, the reach was 52%. This differed between the two locations (59.2% versus 36.8%). The dose received was for the yoga 10.4 sessions/24 weeks and for the workout 11.1 sessions/24 weeks. The attendance rate, defined as the mean percentage of attended group sessions in relation to the total provided group sessions, for the yoga and workout sessions was 51.7% and 44.8%, respectively. For the yoga sessions this rate was different between the two locations (63.2% versus 46.5%). No differences were found between the locations regarding the workout sessions and PVC visits. Workers attended on average 2.7 PVC visits. Overall, workers were satisfied with the intervention components: 7.5 for yoga sessions, 7.8 for workout sessions, and 6.9 for PVC visits. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of the intervention was accomplished as planned with respect to the dose delivered. Based on the reach, most workers were willing to attend the guided group sessions and the PVC visits, although there were differences between the locations and between intervention components. Overall, workers were positive about the intervention. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trial registration NTR1240.	Strijk, Jorien E;Proper, Karin I;van der Beek, Allard J;van Mechelen, Willem	2011 Jun 10
23145356	"Now I see a brighter day": expectations and perceived benefits of an Iyengar yoga intervention for young patients with rheumatoid arthritis.	Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disease characterized by inflammation of joints and associated fatigue, deteriorated range of motion, and impaired psychosocial functioning. Young adults with RA are at a particular risk for compromised health-related quality of life, and there is a need for safe, effective complementary treatment in addition to traditional medical approaches. The aim of the present study was to use face-to-face participant interviews, conducted before and after an Iyengar yoga (IY) program, to examine mechanisms through which yoga may be beneficial to young adults with RA.This pilot study utilized a single-arm design where all participants received the intervention. Classes were taught twice per week (1.5 hours each) for 6 weeks by an IY teacher qualified in therapeutics. Interview themes included participants' baseline expectations about yoga and viewpoints as to how their functioning had been impacted by the IY intervention were examined. Five young adults with RA aged 24-31 years (mean = 28; 80% female) completed the yoga intervention. Participants consistently reported that yoga helped with energy, relaxation and mood and they discussed perceived mechanisms for how yoga impacted well-being. Mechanisms included physical changes such as range of motion and physiological awareness, and psychospiritual developments such as acceptance, coping, self-efficacy and mindfulness. Though the study is limited, participants' responses provide compelling evidence that IY for RA patients is an intervention worthy of further exploration. The mechanisms and outcomes reported by participants support a biopsychosocial model, which proposes that yoga benefits patients through both physiological and psychospiritual changes.

21655478	A leg to stand on.	Learning about mental health at medical school was all about lists. I scribbled lists down the margins of my lecture pads: the DSM-IV criteria for depression and schizophrenia, the side effects of the atypical antipsychotics, the assessment of suicide risk. Lists can be vital in recognising the conditions that need treatment to prevent significant morbidity. In some cases, the right treatment can be lifesaving. However, in the messy mix that is general practice, lists are only part of the equation. In my practice I see many patients who are distressed by psychological symptoms that don't meet the DSM-IV criteria for a specific diagnosis. In these cases, the real challenge is to find ways to help the patient find meaning and a way through the mess.	O'Connor, Kath	2011 Jun

21654973	The importance of spirituality in supportive care.	BACKGROUND: It has been shown that the pineal gland plays a fundamental role in mediating either the spiritual perception or the anticancer immunity by stimulating the endogenous production of anticancer cytokine interleukin (IL)-2. OBJECTIVE: The present study was performed to evaluate the impact of a spiritual approach consisting of Kriya Yoga program alone or in association with melatonin (MLT) or low-dose IL-2 plus MLT on the survival time in a group of metastatic cancer patients with life expectancy less than 1 year. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control study was carried out in 240 patients (M/F: 146/94; median age: 62 years, range: 34-71, suffering from non-small-cell lung cancer or gastrointestinal tumors) who were subdivided into 6 groups of 40 patients, treated with supportive care alone as a control group, supportive care plus Yoga, MLT alone, MLT plus Yoga, inteleukin-2 plus MLT, or IL-2 plus MLT plus Yoga. RESULTS: The best results in terms of increased survival time were obtained by the association between neuroimmunotherapy with MLT plus IL-2 and Yoga program (2 years), which was significantly longer with respect to that achieved by supportive care alone, Yoga alone, or IL-2 plus MLT alone (1 year). CONCLUSIONS: This study would suggest that a spiritual therapeutic approach may improve the survival time of untreatable metastatic solid tumor patients.

21654972	Effect of integrated yoga practices on immune responses in examination stress - A preliminary study.	BACKGROUND: Stress is often associated with an increased occurrence of autonomic, cardiovascular, and immune system pathology. This study was done to evaluate the impact of stress on psychological, physiological parameters, and immune system during medical term -academic examination and the effect of yoga practices on the same. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was carried out on sixty first-year MBBS students randomly assigned to yoga group and control group (30 each). The yoga group underwent integrated yoga practices for 35 minutes daily in the presence of trained yoga teacher for 12 weeks. Control group did not undergo any kind of yoga practice or stress management. Physiological parameters like heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure were measured. Global Assessment of Recent Stress Scale and Spielbergers State Anxiety score were assessed at baseline and during the examination. Serum cortisol levels, IL-4, and IFN-gamma levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. RESULT: In the yoga group, no significant difference was observed in physiological parameters during the examination stress, whereas in the control group, a significant increase was observed. Likewise, the indicators of psychological stress showed highly significant difference in control group compared with significant difference in yoga group. During the examination, the increase in serum cortical and decrease in serum IFN-gamma in yoga group was less significant (P<0.01) than in the control group (P<0.001). Both the groups demonstrated an increase in serum IL-4 levels, the changes being insignificant for the duration of the study. CONCLUSION: Yoga resists the autonomic changes and impairment of cellular immunity seen in examination stress.

21654971	Impact of Yoga Nidra on psychological general wellbeing in patients with menstrual irregularities: A randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Yogic relaxation therapy (Yoga Nidra) has been effectively prescribed in conjunction with other medical and yogic procedures in the management of severe psychosomatic diseases, including cancer, bronchial asthma, colitis, peptic ulcer and menstrual irregularities. AIM OF THE STUDY: To assess the impact of Yoga Nidra on psychological problems in patients with menstrual disorders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were recruited from the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, C.S.M. Medical University (erstwhile KGMU), Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. A total of 150 female subjects were randomly divided into two groups: 1) group of 75 subjects (with yogic intervention) and 2) a control group of 75 subjects (without yogic intervention). Assessment of psychological general wellbeing (tool) was used for all the subjects Assessment of psychological general well being (tool) was used for all the subjects (Cases and controls). This assessment was done twice first time in the beginning (baseline) and then after six months. RESULTS: Anxiety decreased significantly (P<0.003) and depression decreased significantly (P<0.01) in the Yoga group. Positive wellbeing and general health improved significantly (P<0.02), and vitality improved significantly (P<0.01) after six months of Yoga therapy (Yoga Nidra) in the Yoga group compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: The current findings suggest that patients with menstrual irregularities having psychological problems improved significantly in the areas of their wellbeing, anxiety and depression by learning and applying a program based on Yogic intervention (Yoga Nidra).

21654970	Effect of integrated yogic practices on positive and negative emotions in healthy adults.	BACKGROUND: Studies on affective wellbeing have shown the beneficial role of positive emotions on cognitive processing and the harmful role of negative emotions on coping, stress and health status. Studies have shown that yoga practices reduce anxiety and depression and improve wellbeing. OBJECTIVE: The aims of the study were to, (i) examine the safety and feasibility of conducting a weeklong free yoga camp, and (ii) assess its impact on the negative and positive affect in normal healthy volunteers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this open-arm study450 participants were taught integrated yoga module. It included asanas, pranayama, relaxation, notional correction and devotional sessions. Assessment was carried out on the first and last day of the camp, using a modified version of Positive Affect Negative Affect Scale (PANAS). It has ten questions each to measure positive (PA) and negative affect (NA). Nine questions have been added which are referred as other positive affect (OPA) and other negative affect (ONA) domains. RESULTS: Three hundred and twelve sets of pre-post data were analyzed. There was an increase in PA of PANAS by 13% (P<0.001, Wilcoxon's signed rank test) and OPA by 17% (P<0.001). The NA reduced by 47% (P<0.001) and ONA by 48% (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: It is feasible and safe to conduct a weeklong yoga camp in an urban setting, and integrated yoga practices can reduce the negative affect and increase the positive affect within one week.

21654969	Effect of yoga on mental health: Comparative study between young and senior subjects in Japan.	BACKGROUND: Japan has a large number of senior citizens. Yoga can be wisely applied in old age care. There is no any age restriction to practice yoga. The effect may differ by age. There is a need to study the mechanism of action of yoga with respect to age. AIM: This study was conducted in Japan to find the effect of yoga on mental health between young and senior people. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five normal healthy volunteers of both sexes were divided into two groups according to age. Fifteen participants of the age group between 65 to 75 years and 10 participants of the age group between 20 to 30 years were selected. This study was approved by the ethical committee of Kawasaki University of Medical Welfare. Selected individuals were subjected to 90 min of yoga classes once or twice a week for a month. Salivary amylase activity was assessed before and after yoga practice. State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was given before yoga on the first day and after one month of practice to assess the change in State anxiety and Trait anxiety. RESULTS: Senior group - Salivary amylase activity decreased from 111.2+/-42.7 to 83.48+/-39.5 kU/L [average+/-standard deviation]. Younger group - Salivary amylase activity reduced from 60.74+/-31.8 to 42.39+/-24 kU/L. Senior group - State anxiety score decreased from 41.13 +/-8.43 to 30.8+/-6.49, Trait anxiety score reduced from 45.66+/-7.5 to 40.73+/-8.3. Younger group - State anxiety score reduced from 38.7+/-4.8 to 30.8+/-4.1,Trait anxiety score reduced from 46.2+/-7.9 to 42.9+/-9.1. Changes were statistically significant with P<0.05. CONCLUSION: Decrease in Salivary amylase activity may be due to reduction in sympathetic response. Reduction in State and Trait anxiety score signifies that yoga has both immediate as well as long-term effect on anxiety reduction. Thus yoga helps to improve the mental health in both the groups.

21654968	Neurohemodynamic correlates of 'OM' chanting: A pilot functional magnetic resonance imaging study.	BACKGROUND: A sensation of vibration is experienced during audible 'OM' chanting. This has the potential for vagus nerve stimulation through its auricular branches and the effects on the brain thereof. The neurohemodynamic correlates of 'OM' chanting are yet to be explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), the neurohemodynamic correlates of audible 'OM' chanting were examined in right-handed healthy volunteers (n=12; nine men). The 'OM' chanting condition was compared with pronunciation of "ssss" as well as a rest state. fMRI analysis was done using Statistical Parametric Mapping 5 (SPM5). RESULTS: In this study, significant deactivation was observed bilaterally during 'OM' chanting in comparison to the resting brain state in bilateral orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate, parahippocampal gyri, thalami and hippocampi. The right amygdala too demonstrated significant deactivation. No significant activation was observed during 'OM' chanting. In contrast, neither activation nor deactivation occurred in these brain regions during the comparative task - namely the 'ssss' pronunciation condition. CONCLUSION: The neurohemodynamic correlates of 'OM' chanting indicate limbic deactivation. As similar observations have been recorded with vagus nerve stimulation treatment used in depression and epilepsy, the study findings argue for a potential role of this 'OM' chanting in clinical practice.

21649654	Complementary and alternative medicine use among adults with migraines/severe headaches.	OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine patterns, reasons for, and correlates of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use by US adults with migraines/severe headaches. BACKGROUND: While many patients with chronic conditions use CAM, little is known about CAM use by adults with migraines/severe headaches. METHODS: We compared CAM use between adults with and without self-reported migraines/severe headaches using the 2007 National Health Interview Survey (n=23,393), a national cross-sectional survey. RESULTS: Adults with migraines/severe headaches used CAM more frequently than those without (49.5% vs 33.9%, P< .0001); differences persisted after adjustment (adjusted odds ratio=1.29, 95% confidence interval [1.15, 1.45]). Mind-body therapies (eg, deep breathing exercises, meditation, yoga) were used most commonly. More than 50% of adults with migraines/severe headaches reporting CAM use had not discussed it with their health care provider. Nonetheless, those with migraines/severe headaches used CAM more often than those without because of provider recommendation and because conventional treatments were perceived as ineffective or too costly. Correlates of CAM use among adults with migraines/severe headaches included anxiety, joint or low back pain, alcohol use, higher education, and living in the western USA. Only 4.5% of adults with migraines/severe headaches reported using CAM to specifically treat their migraines/severe headaches. CONCLUSIONS: CAM is used more often among adults with migraines/severe headaches than those without. However, few report using CAM to specifically treat migraines/severe headaches. Mind-body therapies are used most frequently. Further research is needed to understand the effectiveness and mechanisms of CAM treatments in adults with migraines/severe headaches.

21647811	Evaluation of the mental health benefits of yoga in a secondary school: a preliminary randomized controlled trial.	The goal of this study was to evaluate potential mental health benefits of yoga for adolescents in secondary school. Students were randomly assigned to either regular physical education classes or to 11 weeks of yoga sessions based upon the Yoga Ed program over a single semester. Students completed baseline and end-program self-report measures of mood, anxiety, perceived stress, resilience, and other mental health variables. Independent evaluation of individual outcome measures revealed that yoga participants showed statistically significant differences over time relative to controls on measures of anger control and fatigue/inertia. Most outcome measures exhibited a pattern of worsening in the control group over time, whereas changes in the yoga group over time were either minimal or showed slight improvements. These preliminary results suggest that implementation of yoga is acceptable and feasible in a secondary school setting and has the potential of playing a protective or preventive role in maintaining mental health.

21641520	Complementary and alternative medicine: perception and use by physiotherapists in the management of low back pain.	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this survey was to investigate complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use by physiotherapists for the treatment of low back pain (LBP). METHODS: Questionnaires (n=1000) were distributed to physiotherapists randomly selected from the UK's Organisation of Chartered Physiotherapists in Private Practice (OCPPP). Results were analysed by SPSS. RESULTS: A response rate of 46% was obtained (n=459). 94.3% of respondents stated that they currently treated LBP; the most common CAMs used by physiotherapists were acupuncture (46.9%) and massage (2.1%). Physiotherapists perceived acupuncture, massage, osteopathy, chiropractic and yoga to be effective in the treatment of LBP, but were unsure about the effectiveness of other CAMs. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Physiotherapists in this sample often use acupuncture and massage to treat LBP, but appear to have little knowledge of other CAMs. Physiotherapists use mainstream methods such as mobilization and massage which could be perceived as CAM depending on the physiotherapists' perceptions and training, as these therapies have also been used and investigated by CAM practitioners. More research is required on the use of CAM as little is known regarding the effectiveness of these therapies on LBP.	Hughes, C M;Quinn, F;Baxter, G D	2011 Jun
21641516	Effect of yogic practices on lipid profile and body fat composition in patients of coronary artery disease.	OBJECTIVES: To observe the effect of regular yogic practices and self-discipline in reducing body fat and elevated lipids in CAD patients. METHOD: In this study one hundred seventy (170) subjects, of both sexes having coronary artery disease were randomly selected form Department of Cardiology. Subjects were divided in to two groups randomly in yoga group and in non-yoga group, eighty five (85) in each group. Out of these (170 subjects), one hundred fifty four (154) completed the study protocol. TIME LINE: The yogic intervention consisted of 35-40 min/day, five days in a week till six months in the Department of Physiology CSMMU UP Lucknow. Body fat testing and estimation of lipid profile were done of the both groups at zero time and after six months of yogic intervention in yoga group and without yogic intervention in non yoga group. RESULTS: In present study, BMI (p<0.04), fat % (p<0.0002), fat free mass (p<0.04), SBP (p<0.002), DBP (p<0.009), heart rate (p<0.0001), total cholesterol (p<0.0001), triglycerides (p<0.0001), HDL (p<0.0001) and low density lipoprotein (p<0.04) were changed significantly. CONCLUSION: Reduction of SBP, DBP, heart rate, body fat%, total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL after regular yogic practices is beneficial for cardiac and hypertensive patients. Therefore yogic practices included in this study are helpful for the patients of coronary artery disease.

21641514	A pilot study of yoga treatment in children with functional abdominal pain and irritable bowel syndrome.	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the effect of yoga exercises on pain frequency and intensity and on quality of life in children with functional abdominal pain. DESIGN: 20 children, aged 8-18 years, with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or functional abdominal pain (FAP) were enrolled and received 10 yoga lessons. Pain intensity and pain frequency were scored in a pain diary and quality of life was measured with the Kidscreen quality of life questionnaire (KQoL). RESULTS: In the 8-11 year old group and the 11-18 year old group pain frequency was significantly decreased at the end of therapy (p=0.031 and p=0.004) compared to baseline. In the 8-11 year group pain intensity was also significantly decreased at this time point (p=0.015). After 3 months there still was a significant decrease in pain frequency in the younger patient group (p=0.04) and a borderline significant decrease in pain frequency in the total group (p=0.052). Parents reported a significantly higher KQoL-score after yoga treatment. CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that yoga exercises are effective for children aged 8-18 years with FAP, resulting in significant reduction of pain intensity and frequency, especially in children of 8-11 years old.

21641250	Pain relief for premature infants during ophthalmology assessment.	BACKGROUND: The ophthalmological examination of premature infants, which is essential for the detection of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), can be painful and distressing for the infant. Various researchers have investigated the benefits of topical anesthesia, oral sucrose, and non pharmacological intervention for pain relief. The purpose of this study is to review the current state of knowledge on the effectiveness of these approaches. METHODS: A literature search was performed with MEDLINE (January 1980 to January 2011) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Issue 1 of 4 (January 2011), to determine the currently available evidence on methods of pain relief for premature infants undergoing ROP examination. RESULTS: Most studies supported the use of topical proparacaine, which marginally decreased pain without any side effects. Oral sucrose did not significantly reduce pain scores during ROP examinations, and withholding feeding before the examination was not beneficial. Infants given pacifiers had lower pain scores than those without pacifiers, and infants who were nested experienced less distress during and after the procedure. Conflicting data existed on the benefits of different examination techniques, but the insertion of a lid speculum appeared to be the most uncomfortable aspect of the screening examination. CONCLUSIONS: Topical anesthetics marginally reduce pain during eye examination in premature infants. Contrary to standard practice, it appears that patients are more comfortable if they are fed before the examination, and there is no benefit of oral sucrose. Nonpharmacological interventions, including sucking on a pacifier and nesting, may also be beneficial.	Kandasamy, Yogavijayan;Smith, Roger;Wright, Ian M R;Hartley, Leo	2011 Jun
21635790	Profile of mood states and stress-related biochemical indices in long-term yoga practitioners.	BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown the short-term or intermediate-term practice of yoga to be useful for ameliorating several mental disorders and psychosomatic disorders. However, little is known about the long-term influences of yoga on the mental state or stress-related biochemical indices. If yoga training has a stress-reduction effect and also improves an individual's mental states for a long time, long-term yoga practitioners may have a better mental state and lower stress-related biochemical indices in comparison to non-experienced participants. This study simultaneously examined the differences in mental states and urinary stress-related biochemical indices between long-term yoga practitioners and non-experienced participants. METHODS: The participants were 38 healthy females with more than 2 years of experience with yoga (long-term yoga group) and 37 age-matched healthy females who had not participated in yoga (control group). Their mental states were assessed using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire. The level of cortisol, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and biopyrrin in urine were used as stress-related biochemical indices. RESULTS: The average self-rated mental disturbance, tension-anxiety, anger-hostility, and fatigue scores of the long-term yoga group were lower than those of the control group. There was a trend toward a higher vigor score in the long-term yoga group than that in the control group. There were no significant differences in the scores for depression and confusion in the POMS between the two groups. The urine 8-OHdG concentration showed a trend toward to being lower in the long-term yoga group in comparison to the control group. There were no significant differences in the levels of urine biopyrrin or cortisol. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that long-term yoga training can reduce the scores related to mental health indicators such as self-rated anxiety, anger, and fatigue.

21627405	Yoga for asthma? A systematic review of randomized clinical trials.	OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of yoga as a treatment option for asthma. METHOD: Seven databases were searched from their inception to October 2010. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and non-randomized clinical trials (NRCTs) were considered, if they investigated any type of yoga in patients with asthma. The selection of studies, data extraction, and validation were performed independently by two reviewers. RESULTS: Six RCTs and one NRCT met the inclusion criteria. Their methodological quality was mostly poor. Three RCTs and one NRCT suggested that yoga leads to a significantly greater reduction in spirometric measures, airway hyperresponsivity, dose of histamine needed to provoke a 20% reduction in forced expiratory volume in the first second, weekly number of asthma attacks, and need for drug treatment. Three RCTs showed no positive effects compared to various control interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The belief that yoga alleviates asthma is not supported by sound evidence. Further, more rigorous trials are warranted.	Posadzki, Paul;Ernst, Edzard	2011 Aug

21620478	Complementary medicine, self-help, and lifestyle interventions for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and the OCD spectrum: a systematic review.	BACKGROUND: In Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) current standard pharmacotherapies may be of limited efficacy. Non-conventional interventions such as Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM), self-help techniques, and lifestyle interventions are commonly used by sufferers of OCD, however to date no systematic review of this specific area exists. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies using CAM, self-help, and lifestyle interventions for treatment of OCD and trichotillomania (TTM). PubMed, PsycINFO, China Academic Journals Full-text Database, The Cochrane Library and CINAHL were searched (up to Jan 11th 2011), for controlled clinical trials using non-conventional interventions for OCD. A quality analysis using a purpose-designed scale and an estimation of effect sizes (Cohen's d) where data was available, were also calculated. RESULTS: The literature search revealed 14 studies that met inclusion criteria. Methodological quality of nutraceutical studies (nutrients and herbal medicines) were rated as high (mean 8.6/10), whereas mind-body or self-help studies were poorer (mean 6.1/10). In OCD, tentative evidentiary support from methodologically weak studies was found for mindfulness meditation (d=0.63), electroacupuncture (d=1.16), and kundalini yoga (d=1.61). Better designed studies using the nutrient glycine (d=1.10), and traditional herbal medicines milk thistle (insufficient data for calculating d) and borage (d=1.67) also revealed positive results. A rigorous study showed that N-acetylcysteine (d=1.31) was effective in TTM, while self-help technique "movement decoupling" also demonstrated efficacy (d=0.94). Mixed evidence was found for myo-inositol (mean d=0.98). Controlled studies suggest that St John's wort, EPA, and meridian-tapping are ineffective in treating OCD. CONCLUSIONS: While several studies were positive, these were un-replicated and commonly used small samples. This precludes firm confidence in the strength of clinical effect. Preliminary evidence however is encouraging, and more rigorous research of some of the more hypothesis-based interventions in the treatment of OCD and TTM may be indicated.

21614942	Effects of yoga on stress management in healthy adults: A systematic review.	OBJECTIVE: This article reports a systematic review and critical appraisal of the effect of yoga on stress management in healthy adults. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical controlled trials (CCTs) that assessed the effects of yoga on stress management in healthy adults. Selected studies were classified according to the types of intervention, duration, outcome measures, and results. They were also qualitatively assessed based on Public Health Research, Education and Development standards. RESULTS: The systematic review was based on eight RCTs and CCTs that indicated a positive effect of yoga in reducing stress levels or stress symptoms. However, most of the studies had methodological problems in that the intervention duration was short and limited follow-up data was available. CONCLUSION: This review revealed positive effects of yoga on stress reduction in healthy adult populations. However, the result should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of studies and the associated methodological problems. Further studies to ascertain yoga's long-term effects and the underlying biological mechanisms leading to its stress reduction effect should be conducted.

21614939	Randomized trial of the effect of an integrative medicine approach to the management of asthma in adults on disease-related quality of life and pulmonary function.	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of an integrative medicine approach to the management of asthma compared to standard clinical care on quality of life (QOL) and clinical outcomes. METHODS: This was a prospective parallel group repeated measurement randomized design. Participants were adults aged 18 to 80 years with asthma. The intervention consisted of six group sessions on the use of nutritional manipulation, yoga techniques, and journaling. Participants also received nutritional supplements: fish oil, vitamin C, and a standardized hops extract. The control group received usual care. Primary outcome measures were the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), The Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-12 (SF-12), and standard pulmonary function tests (PFTs). RESULTS: In total, 154 patients were randomized and included in the intention-to-treat analysis (77 control, 77 treatment). Treatment participants showed greater improvement than controls at 6 months for the AQLQ total score (P<.001) and for three subscales, Activity (P< 0.001), Symptoms (P= .02), and Emotion (P<.001). Treatment participants also showed greater improvement than controls on three of the SF-12 subscales, Physical functioning (P=.003); Role limitations, Physical (P< .001); and Social functioning (P= 0.03), as well as in the aggregate scores for Physical and Mental health (P= .003 and .02, respectively). There was no change in PFTs in either group. CONCLUSION: A low-cost group-oriented integrative medicine intervention can lead to significant improvement in QOL in adults with asthma.

21600812	Prevalence of polycystic ovarian syndrome in Indian adolescents.	BACKGROUND: PCOS is a common female endocrine disorder with prevalence ranging from 2.2% to 26%. Most reports have studied adult women with age ranged from 18 to 45 years. The aim of this study was to find the prevalence of PCOS in Indian adolescents. METHOD: We prospectively studied 460 girls aged 15 to 18 years from a residential college in Andhra Pradesh, South India, who underwent clinical examination. Out of which 72 girls with oligomenorrhea and/or hirsutism were invited for biochemical, hormonal, and ultrasonographic evaluation for diagnosis of PCOS by Rotterdam criteria. PCOS was defined as the presence of any two of the three features: (1) Oligo/amenorrhea: absence of menstruation for 45 days or more and/or </=8 menses per year. (2) Clinical hyperandrogenism: Modified Ferriman and Gallway (mFG) score of 6 or higher. (3) Polycystic ovaries: presence of >10 cysts, 2-8 mm in diameter, usually combined with increased ovarian volume of >10 cm(3), and an echo-dense stroma in pelvic ultrasound scan. RESULTS: Out of 460 girls, one (0.22%) had oligo/amenorrhea with clinical hyperandrogenism, 29 (6.30%) had oligomenorrhea with polycystic ovaries, one (0.22%) had polycystic ovaries with clinical hyperandrogenism and 11 (2.39%) had oligomenorrhea with polycystic ovaries in the presence of clinical hyperandrogenism. Thus 42 (9.13%) girls satisfied Rotterdam's criteria for PCOS, which increased to 50.46 (10.97%) when imputed data were included. CONCLUSION: Prevalence of PCOS in Indian adolescents is 9.13%.This draws attention to the issue of early diagnosis in adolescent girls.

21600053	Peer mentorship to promote effective pain management in adolescents: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: This protocol is for a study of a new program to improve outcomes in children suffering from chronic pain disorders, such as fibromyalgia, recurrent headache, or recurrent abdominal pain. Although teaching active pain self-management skills through cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or a complementary program such as hypnotherapy or yoga has been shown to improve pain and functioning, children with low expectations of skill-building programs may lack motivation to comply with therapists' recommendations. This study will develop and test a new manualized peer-mentorship program which will provide modeling and reinforcement by peers to other adolescents with chronic pain (the mentored participants). The mentorship program will encourage mentored participants to engage in therapies that promote the learning of pain self-management skills and to support the mentored participants' practice of these skills. The study will examine the feasibility of this intervention for both mentors and mentored participants, and will assess the preliminary effectiveness of this program on mentored participants' pain and functional disability. METHODS: This protocol will recruit adolescents ages 12-17 with chronic pain and randomly assign them to either peer mentorship or a treatment-as-usual control group. Mentored participants will be matched with peer mentors of similar age (ages 14-18) who have actively participated in various treatment modalities through the UCLA Pediatric Pain Program and have learned to function successfully with a chronic pain disorder. The mentors will present information to mentored participants in a supervised and monitored telephone interaction for 2 months to encourage participation in skill-building programs. The control group will receive usual care but without the mentorship intervention. Mentored and control subjects' pain and functioning will be assessed at 2 months (end of intervention for mentored participants) and at 4 month follow-up to see if improvements persist. Measures of treatment adherence, pain, disability, and anxiety and depression will be assessed throughout study participation. Qualitative interviews for mentors, mentored participants, and control subjects will also be administered. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01118988.

21597545	What works? Evidence for lifestyle and nonprescription therapies in menopause.	BACKGROUND: Effective prescription medications are available to treat menopausal symptoms. However, due to adverse effects and risks associated with use, many women are seeking complementary and alternative options to treat their symptoms. Nonpharmacological options for the management of menopausal symptoms are widely available and frequently used. OBJECTIVE: This article outlines the use of, and evidence for, nonprescription therapies and complementary therapies for menopausal symptom management. DISCUSSION: There are a large number of studies on complementary and alternative therapies for the management of menopausal symptoms. Lifestyle changes are beneficial and studies on relaxation training are revealing encouraging results. Studies of the benefits of yoga have mixed results. Current evidence from systematic reviews does not support the use of over-the-counter complementary therapies or acupuncture. A large placebo effect exists for the management of hot flushes, therefore further research against active controls is required. Management options should be collaboratively explored.

21590293	Yoga for low back pain: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials.	It has been suggested that yoga has a positive effect on low back pain and function. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of yoga as a treatment option for low back pain. Seven databases were searched from their inception to March 2011. Randomized clinical trials were considered if they investigated yoga in patients with low back pain and if they assessed pain as an outcome measure. The selection of studies, data extraction and validation were performed independently by two reviewers. Seven randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) met the inclusion criteria. Their methodological quality ranged between 2 and 4 on the Jadad scale. Five RCTs suggested that yoga leads to a significantly greater reduction in low back pain than usual care, education or conventional therapeutic exercises. Two RCTs showed no between-group differences. It is concluded that yoga has the potential to alleviate low back pain. However, any definitive claims should be treated with caution.	Posadzki, Paul;Ernst, Edzard	2011 Sep
21563149	Exercise for vasomotor menopausal symptoms.	BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that many perimenopausal and early postmenopausal women will experience menopause symptoms, hot flushes being the most common. Symptoms caused by fluctuating levels of oestrogen may be alleviated by HRT but there has been a marked global decline in its use due to concerns about the risks and benefits of HRT; consequently many women are now seeking alternatives. As large numbers of women are choosing not to take HRT, it is increasingly important to identify evidence based lifestyle modification interventions that have potential to reduce vasomotor menopausal symptoms. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effectiveness of any type of exercise intervention in the management of vasomotor menopausal symptoms (hot flushes and night sweats) in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. SEARCH STRATEGY: Searches of the following electronic bibliographic databases were performed to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs): Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised trials register; Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) (Wiley Internet interface), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), Science Citation Index and Social Science Citation Index (Web of Science), CINAHL (Ovid) and SPORT Discus. Searches included dates up until 16-24 March 2010. SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs in which any type of exercise intervention were compared no treatment/control or other treatments in the management of menopausal vasomotor symptoms in symptomatic perimenopausal/postmenopausal women. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Six studies were deemed eligible for inclusion. Three authors independently extracted data from eligible studies. Three meta-analyses according to comparator the group were performed. MAIN RESULTS: In the comparison of exercise versus no treatment/control (three studies), the non-significant effect size Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) for vasomotor symptoms was -0.14 (95% CI: -0.54 to 0.26); SMD was -0.04, -0.25, -0.38. For the analysis of exercise versus HRT (three studies), the non-significant SMD was 0.49 (95% CI: -0.27 to 1.26); SMD across studies was 0.13, 0.19 and 1.52, with all studies favouring HRT. In the comparison of exercise versus yoga (two studies), the non-significant SMD was -0.09 (95%CI:-0.64 to 0.45); SMD was -0.37 and 0.19. All comparisons were based on small samples. One small study reported data that could not be included in the meta-analysis; in this study hot flush scores were significantly lower in the exercise plus soy milk group (83%) than soy milk only group (72%). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The existing studies provided insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of exercise as a treatment for vasomotor menopausal symptoms, or whether exercise is more effective than HRT or yoga.

21554109	A new educational film control for use in studies of active mind-body therapies: acceptability and feasibility.	OBJECTIVES: The study objectives were to ascertain whether a novel educational film class is an acceptable and feasible comparison group for a randomized controlled trial regarding the effects of an active mind-body therapy on cardiovascular disease risk in postmenopausal women. METHODS: Seventy-five (75) participants attended a baseline assessment visit and were randomly assigned to either a yoga group or an educational film (control) group. Both groups attended two 90-minute classes/week for 8 weeks, followed by a second assessment visit. Those not attending the second assessment were classified as dropouts. Over 60 films covering a range of topics relevant to the study population were evaluated; 15 were selected by consensus of at least 2 researchers and 1 layperson. Each film session followed the same format: an informal greeting period, viewing of the film, and a 15-minute postfilm discussion. To determine acceptability and feasibility of the film class, potential between-group differences in dropout and attendance were examined, and participant feedback given during class and on end-of-study questionnaires were evaluated. RESULTS: The relation between group assignment and dropout was not significant (chi(2) [1, N = 75] = 0.14, p = 0.71). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated no significant between-group difference in number of classes attended for the yoga (X = 13.67 +/- 3.10) versus film group (13.26 +/- 1.97), F(1,63) = 0.39, p = 0.53). Participant feedback regarding the film program was positive. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the feasibility and acceptability of this educational film control. Easy to standardize and tailor to a variety of populations, this film program may offer an attractive alternative to the more traditional educational control.

21549257	The prevalence and characteristics of young and mid-age women who use yoga and meditation: results of a nationally representative survey of 19,209 Australian women.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the characteristics of yoga and meditation users and non-users amongst young and mid-aged Australian women. DESIGN AND SETTING: The research was conducted as part of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH) which was designed to investigate multiple factors affecting the health and well being of women over a 20-year period. PARTICIPANTS: The younger (28-33 years) (n=8885) and mid-aged (56-61 years) (n=10,324) cohorts of the ALSWH who completed Survey 5 in 2006 and 2007 respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Use of yoga. RESULTS: This study estimates that 35% of Australian women aged 28-33 and 27% of Australian women aged 56-61 use yoga or meditation. Younger women with back pain (OR=1.28; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.52) and allergies (OR=1.25; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.49) were more likely to use yoga or meditation, while younger women with migraines or headaches (OR=0.73; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.87) were less likely to use yoga or meditation. Mid-age women with low iron (OR=1.68; 95% CI: 1.29, 2.19) and bowel problems (OR=1.37; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.65) were more likely to use yoga or meditation, while mid age women with hypertension (OR=0.62; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.76) were less likely to use yoga or meditation. CONCLUSION: A large percentage of the female population are using yoga or meditation. Given that women who regularly use yoga or meditation positively associated with measures of mental and physical health, there is a need for further research to examine the experiences and potential benefits of these mind-body practices for women's health.

21549021	Epilepsy (partial).	INTRODUCTION: About 3% of people will be diagnosed with epilepsy during their lifetime, but about 70% of people with epilepsy eventually go into remission. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of starting antiepileptic drug treatment following a single seizure? What are the effects of drug monotherapy in people with partial epilepsy? What are the effects of additional drug treatments in people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy? What is the risk of relapse in people in remission when withdrawing antiepileptic drugs? What are the effects of behavioural and psychological treatments for people with epilepsy? What are the effects of surgery in people with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 83 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antiepileptic drugs after a single seizure; monotherapy for partial epilepsy using carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, phenytoin, sodium valproate, or topiramate; addition of second-line drugs for drug-resistant partial epilepsy (allopurinol, eslicarbazepine, gabapentin, lacosamide, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, losigamone, oxcarbazepine, retigabine, tiagabine, topiramate, vigabatrin, or zonisamide); antiepileptic drug withdrawal for people with partial or generalised epilepsy who are in remission; behavioural and psychological treatments for partial or generalised epilepsy (biofeedback, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), educational programmes, family counselling, relaxation therapy (alone or plus behavioural modification therapy, yoga); and surgery for drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy ( lesionectomy, temporal lobectomy, vagus nerve stimulation as adjunctive therapy).

21547050	Ankylosing spondylitis.	Ankylosing spondylitis belongs to a group of rheumatic diseases known as the spondyloarthropathies (SpA), which show a strong association with the genetic marker HLA-B27. Inflammatory back pain and stiffness are prominent early in the disease, whereas chronic, aggressive disease may produce pain and marked axial immobility or deformity. Modern medicine has no established treatment for it. From the Ayurvedic perspective, the disease can fall under amavata, which may be effectively managed when intervention is started in its early stages. Niruha basthi with Balaguduchyadi yoga, combined by Shamana treatment with Rasnerandadi kwatha and Simhanada guggulu have been found effective in curbing its progression. This article presents a single case report in which these treatments achieved considerable success.	Edavalath, Mukesh	2010 Jul
21526369	The qigong of 18 Luohan Hands and yoga for prevention of low back pain: A conceptual synthesis.	The practice of hathayoga is based on the following assumptions: complexity and multidimensionality of various positive influences on an individual's wholeness through the mind, body and their conscious control. On the other hand, the practice of the qigong of 18 Luohan Hands is based on slow movements designed to mobilise qi within the body. This article presents a conceptual integration of yoga and qigong when considering the congruence of beneficial effects for various systems of the body and prevention of low back pain (LBP). The author emphasizes the usefulness of qigong and yoga practice in clinical units and explains how the essence of these practices relates to each other. The justification of this fusion as well as differences between these two modalities are also described and explained. Within the scope of this article the existence of several similarities between these two practices has been suggested for both practitioners and researchers. They can obtain valuable and additional arguments through cross-fertilization of ideas across presented studies united by shared, underlying biomechanical concepts and physiological effects. Such conceptual enrichment may be a useful source of inspiration for qigong and yoga practitioners who tend to prevent LBP and therapists (physiotherapists, occupational therapists, rehabilitants, nurses, bodywork and movement therapists or massage therapists) intended to manage their patients' back pains and overall health on a daily basis.

21514190	Effect of three yoga poses (cobra, cat and fish poses) in women with primary dysmenorrhea: a randomized clinical trial.	OBJECTIVE: We have evaluated the clinical efficacy of yoga for primary dysmenorrhea. Primary dysmenorrhea occurs in 50% of female adolescents and is a common problem in women of reproductive age. We have assessed whether three yoga poses (Cobra, Cat, and Fish Poses) are able to reduce severity and duration of primary dysmenorrhea. METHODS: To determine the effectiveness of yoga in adolescents with primary dysmenorrhea, 92 girl students,18-22 years old, were randomly assigned to an experimental group (n = 50) and a control group (n = 42). The Visual Analog Scale for Pain was used to assess intensity of pain and the pain duration was calculated in terms of hours. Each group was evaluated for three menstrual cycles. At first cycle no method was presented; the participants only were asked to complete the questionnaire of menstrual characteristics during their menstrual. Then the participants were asked by the experimental group to do yoga poses at luteal phase, and also to complete the menstrual characteristics questionnaire in during of menstruation. The control group did not receive any intervention except to complete menstrual characteristics questionnaire in during of menstruation. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the pain intensity and pain duration in the post-tests compared with the pretest in yoga group (P < 0.05). The results showed that compared with the Control group, there was a significant difference in the pain intensity and pain duration in the experimental group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Yoga reduced the severity and duration of primary dysmenorrhea. The findings suggest that yoga poses are safe and simple treatment for primary dysmenorrhea.	Rakhshaee, Zahra	2011 Aug
21510816	Becoming connected: the lived experience of yoga participation after stroke.	PURPOSE: To investigate the personal experiences and perceived outcomes of a yoga programme for stroke survivors. METHOD: This article reports on a preliminary study using qualitative methods to investigate the personal experiences and perceived outcomes of a yoga programme. Nine individuals who had experienced stroke were interviewed following a 10-week yoga programme involving movement, breathing and meditation practices. An interpretative phenomenological approach was used to determine meanings attached to yoga participation as well as perceptions of outcomes. RESULTS: Interpretative themes evolving from the data were organised around a bio-psychosocial model of health benefits from yoga. Emergent themes from the analysis included: greater sensation; feeling calmer and becoming connected. These themes respectively revealed perceived physical improvements in terms of strength, range of movement or walking ability, an improved sense of calmness and the possibility for reconnecting and accepting a different body. CONCLUSION: The study has generated original findings that suggest that from the perspective of people who have had a stroke yoga participation can provide a number of meaningful physical, psychological and social benefits and support the rationale for incorporating yoga and meditation-based practices into rehabilitation programmes.

21506018	Mindfulness based stress reduction in post-treatment breast cancer patients: an examination of symptoms and symptom clusters.	To investigate prevalence and severity of symptoms and symptom clustering in breast cancer survivors who attended MBSR(BC). Women were randomly assigned into MBSR(BC) or Usual Care (UC). Eligible women were >/= 21 years, had been diagnosed with breast cancer and completed treatment within 18 months of enrollment. Symptoms and interference with daily living were measured pre- and post-MBSR(BC) using the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory. Symptoms were reported as highly prevalent but severity was low. Fatigue was the most frequently reported and severe symptom among groups. Symptoms clustered into 3 groups and improved in both groups. At baseline, both MBSR(BC) and the control groups showed similar mean symptom severity and interference; however, after the 6-week post-intervention, the MBSR(BC) group showed statistically-significant reduction for fatigue and disturbed sleep (P < 0.01) and improved symptom interference items, compared to the control group. For the between-group comparisons, 11 of 13 symptoms and 5 of 6 interference items had lower means in the MBSR(BC) condition than the control condition. These results suggest that MBSR(BC) modestly decreases fatigue and sleep disturbances, but has a greater effect on the degree to which symptoms interfere with many facets of life. Although these results are preliminary, MBSR intervention post-treatment may effectively reduce fatigue and related interference in QOL of breast cancer survivors.

21504264	Complementary and alternative medicine behaviors and beliefs in urban adolescents with asthma.	BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Up to 80% of adolescents with asthma have used complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for symptom management. However, little is known about patient characteristics associated with CAM factors other than use. Previous studies recommend provider-patient discussion of CAM use, although few adolescents with asthma disclose their CAM use to their providers. To inform clinical interactions, this study examined prevalence and predictors of CAM use, consideration of use, disclosure of use, and perceived efficacy of use, in urban adolescents with asthma. METHODS: Adolescents with asthma (N = 151) recruited from a children's hospital completed questionnaires addressing demographic and clinical variables and 10 CAM modalities. Response frequencies to four questions assessing CAM use, consideration of use, disclosure, and perceived efficacy were calculated for each modality. Multivariable logistic regression analyses examined characteristics associated with responses to each question for the two most commonly used CAM modalities. RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 15.8 (SD = 1.8), 60% were female and 85% were African-American. Seventy-one percent reported using CAM for symptom management in the past month. Relaxation (64%) and prayer (61%) were the most frequently reported modalities and were perceived to be the most efficacious. Adolescents most commonly reported considering using relaxation (85%) and prayer (80%) for future symptom management. Participants were most likely to disclose their use of yoga (59%) and diet (57%), and least likely to disclose prayer (33%) and guided imagery (36%) to providers. In multivariable analyses, older adolescents (OR = 1.27, p < .05) and African-Americans (OR = 2.76, p < .05) were more likely to use relaxation. Adolescents with more frequent asthma symptoms (OR = 0.98, p < .05) were more likely to use prayer. African-Americans were more likely to report using prayer (OR = 3.47, p < .05) and consider using prayer (OR = 7.98, p < .01) in the future for symptom management. CONCLUSIONS: Many urban adolescents used and would consider using CAM, specifically relaxation and prayer, for asthma symptom management. African-Americans, older adolescents, and those with more frequent symptoms were more likely to use and/or consider using CAM. Providers caring for urban adolescents with asthma should discuss CAM with patients, particularly those identified as likely to use CAM. Future studies should examine relationships between CAM use and health outcomes.	Cotton, Sian;Luberto, Christina M;Yi, Michael S;Tsevat, Joel	2011 Jun
21489869	A pilot study of gentle yoga for sleep disturbance in women with osteoarthritis.	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility and acceptability of a gentle yoga intervention for sleep disturbance in older women with osteoarthritis (OA) and to collect initial efficacy data on the intervention. METHODS: All participants completed an 8-week yoga program that included 75-min weekly classes and 20 min of nightly home practice. Participants were women with OA and symptoms consistent with insomnia. Symptom questionnaires and 1 week of wrist actigraphy and sleep diaries were completed for 1 week pre- and post-intervention. RESULTS: Fourteen women were enrolled of whom 13 completed the study (mean age 65.2 +/- 6.9 years). Participants attended a mean of 7.2 +/- 1.0 classes and practiced at home 5.83 +/- 1.66 nights/week. The Insomnia Severity Index and diary-reported sleep onset latency, sleep efficiency, and number of nights with insomnia were significantly improved at post-intervention versus pre-intervention (p < .05). Other sleep outcomes (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, diary-reported total sleep time and wake after sleep onset) showed improvement on mean scores at post-intervention, but these were not statistically significant. Actigraphic sleep outcomes were not significantly changed. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the feasibility and acceptability of a standardized evening yoga practice for middle-aged to older women with OA. Preliminary efficacy findings support further research on this program as a potential treatment option for OA-related insomnia.	Taibi, Diana M;Vitiello, Michael V	2011 May
21486495	Heart rate variability changes during high frequency yoga breathing and breath awareness.	BACKGROUND: Pre and post comparison after one minute of high frequency yoga breathing (HFYB) suggested that the HFYB modifies the autonomic status by increasing sympathetic modulation, but its effect during the practice was not assessed. METHODS: Thirty-eight male volunteers with group average age +/- S.D., 23.3 +/- 4.4 years were each assessed on two separate days in two sessions, (i) HFYB and (ii) breath awareness. Each session was for 35 minutes, with 3 periods, i.e., pre (5 minutes), during HFYB or breath awareness (15 minutes) and post (5 minutes). RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in NN50, pNN50 and the mean RR interval during and after HFYB and after breath awareness, compared to the respective 'pre' values (p < 0.05) (repeated measures ANOVA followed by post-hoc analysis). The LF power increased and HF power decreased during and after breath awareness and LF/HF ratio increased after breath awareness (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that there was reduced parasympathetic modulation during and after HFYB and increased sympathetic modulation with reduced parasympathetic modulation during and after breath awareness.

21481278	Effect of one week of yoga on function and severity in rheumatoid arthritis.	BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that yoga practice improved the hand grip strength in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). FINDINGS: Sixty-four participants with RA (group average age +/- S.D., 46.5 +/- 9.6 years; 47 females) were assessed at the beginning and end of a one week yoga program. The Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), hand grip strength, rheumatoid factor, and C-reactive protein levels were assessed on the first and last day and compared using a t-test for paired data. All participants showed reduced disability scores of the HAQ and rheumatoid factor levels, with an increase in bilateral hand grip strength in male participants alone. CONCLUSIONS: This single group study indicated that a brief intensive yoga program was beneficial in RA, with decreased disability, better functionality and changes in the rheumatoid factor levels suggesting improvement.

21481259	Nurses' experiences, expectations, and preferences for mind-body practices to reduce stress.	BACKGROUND: Most research on the impact of mind-body training does not ask about participants' baseline experience, expectations, or preferences for training. To better plan participant-centered mind-body intervention trials for nurses to reduce occupational stress, such descriptive information would be valuable. METHODS: We conducted an anonymous email survey between April and June, 2010 of North American nurses interested in mind-body training to reduce stress. The e-survey included: demographic characteristics, health conditions and stress levels; experiences with mind-body practices; expected health benefits; training preferences; and willingness to participate in future randomized controlled trials. RESULTS: Of the 342 respondents, 96% were women and 92% were Caucasian. Most (73%) reported one or more health conditions, notably anxiety (49%); back pain (41%); GI problems such as irritable bowel syndrome (34%); or depression (33%). Their median occupational stress level was 4 (0 = none; 5 = extreme stress). Nearly all (99%) reported already using one or more mind-body practices to reduce stress: intercessory prayer (86%), breath-focused meditation (49%), healing or therapeutic touch (39%), yoga/tai chi/qi gong (34%), or mindfulness-based meditation (18%). The greatest expected benefits were for greater spiritual well-being (56%); serenity, calm, or inner peace (54%); better mood (51%); more compassion (50%); or better sleep (42%). Most (65%) wanted additional training; convenience (74% essential or very important), was more important than the program's reputation (49%) or scientific evidence about effectiveness (32%) in program selection. Most (65%) were willing to participate in a randomized trial of mind-body training; among these, most were willing to collect salivary cortisol (60%), or serum biomarkers (53%) to assess the impact of training. CONCLUSIONS: Most nurses interested in mind-body training already engage in such practices. They have greater expectations about spiritual and emotional than physical benefits, but are willing to participate in studies and to collect biomarker data. Recruitment may depend more on convenience than a program's scientific basis or reputation. Knowledge of participants' baseline experiences, expectations, and preferences helps inform future training and research on mind-body approaches to reduce stress.

21473781	Body Awareness: a phenomenological inquiry into the common ground of mind-body therapies.	Enhancing body awareness has been described as a key element or a mechanism of action for therapeutic approaches often categorized as mind-body approaches, such as yoga, TaiChi, Body-Oriented Psychotherapy, Body Awareness Therapy, mindfulness based therapies/meditation, Feldenkrais, Alexander Method, Breath Therapy and others with reported benefits for a variety of health conditions. To better understand the conceptualization of body awareness in mind-body therapies, leading practitioners and teaching faculty of these approaches were invited as well as their patients to participate in focus groups. The qualitative analysis of these focus groups with representative practitioners of body awareness practices, and the perspectives of their patients, elucidated the common ground of their understanding of body awareness. For them body awareness is an inseparable aspect of embodied self awareness realized in action and interaction with the environment and world. It is the awareness of embodiment as an innate tendency of our organism for emergent self-organization and wholeness. The process that patients undergo in these therapies was seen as a progression towards greater unity between body and self, very similar to the conceptualization of embodiment as dialectic of body and self described by some philosophers as being experienced in distinct developmental levels.

21469252	[Physiophilosophical fundamentals and genesis of Tsigun, Indian, and Tibetan Yoga. Paramount empirical efficacy].	This article is devoted to the analysis of physiophilosophical fundamentals and genesis of Tsigun, Indian, and Tibetan Yoga based on the overview of the relevant literature with special reference to the methodology of these physical and mental disciplines and their therapeutic and health-giving efficacy. Based on the combination of physiophilosophical categories and medical knowledge in the framework of the concept of the five primary elements, the authors illustrate the development of the systemic approach by which ancient physicians related man to nature in order to derive the adaptation principle realized through human activities. Traditional and modern aspects of these activities are considered. In the traditional context, the performance of exercises as assigned by Tsigun, Indian, and Tibetan Yoga is considered as the purposeful realization of the energy of conscience for health improvement and development and in the modern context as the realization of a novel form of psychic creative capacity to the same effect based on fruitful brainwork.

23569742	Antimicrobial drug resistance of Staphylococcus aureus in dairy products.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of multidrug resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) in dairy products. METHODS: Isolation and identification of S. aureus were performed in 3 dairy-based food products. The isolates were tested for their susceptibility to 5 different common antimicrobial drugs. RESULTS: Of 50 samples examined, 5 (10%) were contaminated with S. aureus. Subsequently, the 5 isolates were subjected to antimicrobial resistance pattern using five antibiotic discs (methicillin, vancomycin, kanamycin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline). Sample 29 showed resistance to methicillin and vancomycin. Sample 18 showed intermediate response to tetracycline. The other samples were susceptible to all the antibiotics tested. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide preliminary data on sources of food contamination which may act as vehicles for the transmission of antimicrobial-resistant Staphylococcus. Therefore, it enables us to develop preventive strategies to avoid the emergence of new strains of resistant S. aureus.	Sasidharan, S;Prema, B;Yoga, Latha L	2011 Apr
21446368	An evaluation of pulmonary parameters in two groups of subjects during Yoga practice.	The purpose of the present study was to investigate how far the short term practice of yoga (30 and 60 days) for an hour daily can improve the respiratory function. Male subjects (n=50, age 30-50 years) were randomly selected. Respiratory parameters (FVC, FEV1, PEFR, FEF(25-75%) and MVV) were determined by using a multifunctional computerized spirometer. Yoga (posture and pranayamas) practice for a month produced no significant improvement in pulmonary parameters. Nevertheless, when the subjects continued it for next 30 days, i.e., after 60 days significant changes were noted in FVC (p<0.001), FEV, (p<0.01) and PEFR (p<0.05). The result also revealed that amongst them 30 days yoga training resulted in a significant increase in FVC in elder group of people (age 41-50 yrs) where as in younger group (age 30-40 yrs) the changes were not so prominent. Result indicated that short term (30 days) yoga practice quickly improves respiratory functions in relatively elder people (age 41-50 yrs), when many of them in our tropical country suffer from primary level of respiratory problem. Regular practice of Yoga (posture and pranayamas) can prevent it by increasing the efficacy of respiratory muscles.	Ahmed, Q R;Sau, S K;Kar, S K	2010 Sep
21437197	Effects of yoga on psychological health, quality of life, and physical health of patients with cancer: a meta-analysis.	Yoga is one of the most widely used complementary and alternative medicine therapies to manage illness. This meta-analysis aimed to determine the effects of yoga on psychological health, quality of life, and physical health of patients with cancer. Studies were identified through a systematic search of seven electronic databases and were selected if they used a randomized controlled trial design to examine the effects of yoga in patients with cancer. The quality of each article was rated by two of the authors using the PEDro Scale. Ten articles were selected; their PEDro scores ranged from 4 to 7. The yoga groups compared to waitlist control groups or supportive therapy groups showed significantly greater improvements in psychological health: anxiety (P = .009), depression (P = .002), distress (P = .003), and stress (P = .006). However, due to the mixed and low to fair quality and small number of studies conducted, the findings are preliminary and limited and should be confirmed through higher-quality, randomized controlled trials.

21433078	Use of postmortem human subjects to describe injury responses and tolerances.	Traumatic injuries from blunt, penetrating, and blast events expose the human body to unintentional and intentional external mechanical loads. To mitigate trauma and develop safety-engineered devices for clinical and bioengineering applications, it is critical to delineate the structural load-bearing anatomy and biomechanics of the various components of the human body. This article presents advances made in the understanding of the injury responses and tolerances through experiments conducted using intact or segmented tissues from postmortem human subjects (PMHS), and a considerable majority of data for the presentation has been extracted from studies conducted at the Institutions of the authors. The role of the PMHS model for studying traumatic injuries to the head and face, vertebral column (cervical, thoracic and lumbar spines), thorax, abdomen, pelvis, and lower extremities is discussed. Different impact loading scenarios, likely responsible for the initial trauma causation, are considered in the analysis and determination of the human response to injury. Clinical advances made using the PMHS model are discussed. This includes vertebral stabilization system evaluations secondary to traumatic injuries to the spinal column. The critical importance of using data from the PMHS model in developing validated computational models for advancing crashworthiness research, occupant safety in motor vehicle crashes, medical devices, and safety-engineering applications is highlighted.

21419361	A mathematical model of effects on specific joints during practice of the Sun Salutation--a sequence of yoga postures.	The 'Sun Salutation' consists of a sequence of ten yoga postures, each posture counteracting the preceding one producing a balance between flexion and extension, performed with synchronized breathing and aerobic activity. As this sequence is often performed and recommended by many yoga practitioners, there is a need for the development of a biomechanical model to support its reported clinical benefits. This requires a detailed knowledge of the nature of the forces and moments at the various joints involved. A simple mathematical model based on rigid body mechanics is developed for each of the Sun Salutation postures. Dynamic moments with high magnitudes and rates, applied with unusual distribution patterns, optimal for osteogenesis, are found to occur. Also, the joints are subjected to submaximal loadings thus ensuring that none of the joints are overstressed.	Omkar, S N;Mour, Meenakshi;Das, Debarun	2011 Apr
21417810	The effect of add-on yogic prana energization technique (YPET) on healing of fresh fractures: a randomized control study.	OBJECTIVES: The objective was to study the effect of the add-on yogic prana energization technique (YPET) on healing of fresh fractures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty (30) patients (22 men and 8 women) between 18 and 55 years with simple extra-articular fractures of long and short bones were selected from the outpatient department of Ebnezar Orthopaedic Centre and Parimala Speciality Hospital, Bengaluru. They were randomized into yoga (n = 15) and control (n = 15) groups. Compound, complicated, pathologic fractures, old fractures, and those associated with dislocations were excluded. Both groups received the conventional plaster of paris immobilization of the fracture site as the primary treatment. The yoga group, in addition, practiced YPET twice a day (30 minutes/session) for 2 weeks using taped audio instructions after learning under supervision for 1 week. YPET is an advanced yoga relaxation practice that involves breath regulation, chanting, and visualization, which according to yogic science revitalizes the tissues by activating the subtle energies (prana) within the body. Both the groups were assessed on the 1st and 21st day by the Numerical Pain Rating Scale for pain (NRS), tenderness (0-4), swelling (0-4), fracture line density (1-4), and the bridging of cortices (1-4). RESULTS: Two (2) groups were matched on all variables. The Wilcoxon test showed significant improvement in both groups on all variables. Pain reduction (NRS) was better (p = 0.001 Mann-Whitney test) in the YPET group (94.5%) than in the control group (58.6%); Tenderness reduced (p = 0.001) better in the YPET group (94.4 %) than in the control group (69.12%); Swelling reduced by 93% in the YPET group and by 69.4% in controls (between-groups p = 0.093, i.e., nonsignificant); increase in fracture line density was better (p = 0.001) in the YPET group (48%) than in the control group (18.25%). The number of cortices united was significantly better (p = 0.001) in the YPET group (81.4%) than in controls (39.7 %). CONCLUSIONS: Add-on yoga-based YPET accelerates fracture healing.

21385519	Using silver yoga exercises to promote physical and mental health of elders with dementia in long-term care facilities.	BACKGROUND: This study aimed to test the effects of yoga exercises on the physical and mental health of elderly people with dementia living in long-term care facilities. METHODS: A quasi-experimental, pretest-post-test design was used. A convenience sample of 68 residents in long-term care facilities in southern Taiwan, aged 60 years and above with mild to moderate dementia, was selected. An experimental group of 33 elders participated in a 12-week yoga training program of three 55-minute sessions a week; a control group of 35 elders maintained their usual daily activities. Data were collected before and after completing the 12-week study. Measurements included body composition, cardiopulmonary functions, body flexibility, muscle strength and endurance, balance, joints motion, depression, and problem behaviors. RESULTS: The yoga-trained participants had better physical and mental health than those who did not participate, including lowered blood pressure, reduced respiration rate, strengthened cardiopulmonary fitness, enhanced body flexibility, improved muscle strength and endurance, improved balance, and increased joints motion (all p values < 0.05). In addition, the depression state (p < 0.001) and problem behaviors (p < 0.001) of these demented elders were significantly reduced. CONCLUSION: Yoga exercise has positive benefits for both the physical and mental health of elders with dementia living in long-term care facilities. It is recommended that yoga be included as one of the routine activities in these long-term care facilities.	Fan, Jue-Ting;Chen, Kuei-Min	2011 Oct
21360035	Integrative oncology research in the Middle East: weaving traditional and complementary medicine in supportive care.	INTRODUCTION: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has an important role in supportive cancer care in the Middle East and is often used in association with traditional medicine. This article provides a comprehensive review of published data on CAM research in supportive cancer care in the Middle East. METHODS AND RESULTS: A multi-disciplinary Middle-Eastern Research Group in Integrative Oncology (MERGIO) was established in six countries. Authors independently searched Medline database for articles in Arabic, Hebrew, French, and Turkish using oncology and CAM-related keywords. Articles were recorded according to the first author's affiliation with an academic or clinical institution in the Middle East. RESULTS: We identified 143 articles on CAM and cancer care that had been published in 12 Middle-Eastern countries. Eighty-five articles were directly related to cancer supportive care. The latter included studies on the prevalence of CAM use by patients with cancer, aspects related to of doctor-patient communication, ethics and regulation, psychosocial aspects of CAM, CAM safety and quality assurance, studies of CAM education for health care providers, and ethno-botanical studies and reviews. Twenty-eight articles referred to clinical research on supportive care, and the use of specific CAM modalities that included acupuncture, anthroposophic medicine, dietary and nutritional therapies herbal medicine, homeopathy, mind-body medicine, shiatsu, therapeutic touch, and yoga. CONCLUSIONS: CAM-related supportive care research is prevalent in the Middle East, a fact that may serve as a basis for future multinational-multidisciplinary research work in supportive care in oncology.

21358827	Waiting to descend.	A second-time mother uses a combination of comfort measures and hypnosis for childbirth to achieve a medication-free birth. In the hospital, her use of hypnosis and the posterior position of her cervix made it appear that she was not dilated. After she was fully dilated, pushing took several hours. Throughout the birth, the mother remained calm and did not experience pain, thanks to her practice with prenatal yoga and the Hypnobabies method of childbirth.	Berger, Stephanie	2010 Spring
21355946	Effect of Iyengar yoga practice on fatigue and diurnal salivary cortisol concentration in breast cancer survivors.	PURPOSE: To examine the effect of regular Iyengar yoga practice on measures of self-perceived psychosocial function and diurnal salivary cortisol secretion in stage II-IV breast cancer survivors (n = 18). DATA SOURCES: Women were randomly assigned to attend yoga practice for 90 min twice weekly for 8 weeks (n = 9) or to a wait-listed, noninterventional control group (n = 9). Traditional Iyengar yoga routines that progressively increased in difficulty as participants gained strength and flexibility were used. At baseline and after the 8-week study period, women completed self-report instruments to document various aspects of psychosocial and physical functioning, and collected salivary samples for cortisol analysis four times during the day for two consecutive days. CONCLUSIONS: The yoga group had lower morning and 5 p.m. salivary cortisol and improved emotional well-being and fatigue scores. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Breast cancer survivors are at risk for chronic psychosocial distress that may alter activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, resulting in aberrant regulation of cortisol secretion and increased risk of immune dysfunction and cancer progression. Regular yoga practice may be a low-risk, cost-effective way to improve psychosocial functioning, fatigue, and regulation of cortisol secretion in breast cancer survivors. These findings require validation with a larger randomized study.	Banasik, Jacquelyn;Williams, Holly;Haberman, Mel;Blank, Sally E;Bendel, Robert	2011 Mar
21347940	Understanding wellness center loyalty through lifestyle analysis.	Many changes taking place at a macro-level in Indian society along with the popularity of services that are native to India, such as Yoga and Ayurveda, have generated significant interest in wellness services. To assist wellness centers in gaining loyal clients, the goal of this study was to understand the influence of customer lifestyle factors on wellness center loyalty. The activities, interests, and opinions model was used to understand the lifestyles of wellness center clients. Data were collected from clients of five wellness centers. Regression results indicate that overworked individuals and those seeking a balance between work and family life would be the most loyal to wellness centers. Managerial implications of results are discussed.	Suresh, Satya;Ravichandran, Swathi;P, Ganesan	2011 Jan
21346001	Dopaminergic stimulation enhances confidence and accuracy in seeing rapidly presented words.	Liberal acceptance, overconfidence, and increased activity of the neurotransmitter dopamine have been proposed to account for abnormal sensory experiences, for instance, hallucinations in schizophrenia. In normal subjects, increased sensory experience in Yoga Nidra meditation is linked to striatal dopamine release. We therefore hypothesize that the neurotransmitter dopamine may function as a regulator of subjective confidence of visual perception in the normal brain. Although much is known about the effect of stimulation by neurotransmitters on cognitive functions, their effect on subjective confidence of perception has never been recorded experimentally before. In a controlled study of 24 normal, healthy female university students with the dopamine agonist pergolide given orally, we show that dopaminergic activation increases confidence in seeing rapidly presented words. It also improves performance in a forced-choice word recognition task. These results demonstrate neurotransmitter regulation of subjective conscious experience of perception and provide evidence for a crucial role of dopamine.

21342165	Integrating modern dermatology and Ayurveda in the treatment of vitiligo and lymphedema in India.	BACKGROUND: Globally, governments have recognized the growing popularity of Complementary and Alternative Medicines and the possibility of their combined use with biomedicine. Decisions within the Government of India have led to a conducive environment for conducting clinical studies, to achieve integration of more than one system of medicine, so that their combined benefits can be brought to bear on chronic, difficult-to-treat conditions. AIM: To develop integrative dermatology treatment protocols for patients with long-standing skin diseases who have received treatment from many centers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A team of doctors from modern dermatology, Ayurveda, yoga therapy, and homeopathy studied recruited patients to develop mutual orientation on each therapeutic system and a working knowledge of approach to their clinical diagnosis. Six-hundred thirty-eight patients affected by lower limb lymphedema requiring skin care as a major part of treatment were treated integrating modern dermatology and Ayurveda. Three-hundred eighty-one vitiligo patients were examined and treated to understand the clinical presentations and treatment options in Ayurveda. RESULTS: A two-step cluster analysis performed by SPSS Version 16 showed average volume reductions of 13.3% and 23% on day 14, 19.7% and 31.1% on day 45, and 23.4% and 39.7% on day 90 of treatment in small and large lymphedematous limbs. Inflammatory episodes before the onset on this treatment was reported by 79.5% of our lymphedema patients, and 9.4% reported this at the end of three months after our treatment. Among vitiligo patients, we found that 39.6% of patients had kapha, 39.8% pitta, 10.8% had vatha and 0.52% has tridoshaja presentation. There are over 100 treatment options available in Ayurveda to treat vitiligo. DISCUSSION: Each system of medicine recognizes the same disease albeit with minor difference in description. Skin care procedures like washing and emollients restore the barrier function and skin health. We have converged Ayurvedic skin care with that of dermatology with an aim of achieving patient management that is better than that achievable by a single system alone. Overload of the lymphatic system due to loss of epidermal barrier function and consequent inflammation from bacteria and soil irritants is responsive to selected Ayurvedic herbal preparations. CONCLUSION: It is evident that integration at the therapeutic level is possible, although the pathological basis is interpreted differently. Irrespective of background understanding of the given disease, a mutually oriented multisystem therapeutic team was able to effectively use medicines from more than one system of medicine and to develop guidelines for their prescription and a patient care algorithm.

21327168	Modern Medicine: Towards Prevention, Cure, Well-being and Longevity.	Modern medicine has done much in the fields of infectious diseases and emergencies to aid cure. In most other fields, it is mostly control that it aims for, which is another name for palliation. Pharmacology, psychopharmacology included, is mostly directed towards such control and palliation too. The thrust, both of clinicians and research, must now turn decisively towards prevention and cure. Also, longevity with well-being is modern medicine's other big challenge. Advances in vaccines for hypertension, diabetes, cancers etc, deserve attention; as also, the role of meditation, yoga, spirituality etc in preventing disease at various levels. Studies on longevity, life style changes and healthy centenarians deserve special scrutiny to find what aids longevity with wellbeing. A close look at complementary and alternative medicine is needed to find any suitable models they may have, cutting aside their big talk and/or hostility towards mainstream medical care. Medicine is a manifestation of the human eros, and should not become a means of its thanatos. It must realise its true potential, so that eros prevails, and thanatos prevails only ultimately, not prematurely.	Singh, Ajai R	2010 Jan
21325906	The experience of persons with allergic respiratory symptoms: practicing yoga as a self-healing modality.	The purpose of this study was to describe the experience of persons with allergic respiratory symptoms who practice yoga as a self-healing modality. Fifteen participants were interviewed. Using the content analysis method, 5 themes emerged from the data: perceived positive effects, powerful and harmonious inner energy, mindfulness and self-awareness, understanding self and others, and promoting and achieving a state of balance and harmony. These findings foster the value of knowing the experience of persons who practice yoga as an intervention in holistic nursing.

21319628	Meditation and attention: a comment on a recent article.	Meditation and attention are considered associated in different ways. For example, contemporary concepts state that to meditate, a practitioner has either to (i) focus attention on the object of meditation (FA) or (ii) maintain vigilance and disengage their attention consciously from all distracters (OM). The Indian sage Patanjali (circa 900 B.C.), mentioned that there are two stages of meditation, which differ subtly from the descriptions of FA and OM. One stage is called dharana, or focusing attention on the object of meditation. Another stage is called dhyana, during which all thoughts remain effortlessly directed to the object of meditation, excluding all other thoughts. Vigilance and attention are not required during dhyana, which is the actual phase of meditation. In a previous study, participants who practiced dharana performed better in a task for selective attention than those who practiced dhyana. Brainstem auditory evoked potential changes during the two states differed. Descriptions of yoga practices from ancient texts can give added insights about meditation and attention, supported by objective assessments.	Telles, Shirley;Naveen, K V;Balkrishna, Acharya	2010 Dec
21308266	Mind-body interventions for the treatment of insomnia: a review.	OBJECTIVE: As insomnia is highly prevalent, and side effects of medication are well-known, mind-body interventions are increasingly being sought. The objective of this study is to present a narrative review regarding the effects of mind-body interventions for the treatment of insomnia. METHOD: A PubMed search was conducted including only randomized, controlled trials in which the main objective was to treat insomnia. DISCUSSION: Twelve studies were selected. In three of the studies, objective parameters (polysomnography) were analyzed. Mind-body interventions were able to improve sleep efficiency and total sleep time. Most can ameliorate sleep quality; some can reduce the use of hypnotic drugs in those who are dependent on these drugs. CONCLUSION: According to the studies we selected, self-reported sleep was improved by all mind-body treatments, among them yoga, relaxation, Tai Chi Chih and music. Cognitive behavioral therapy seems to be the most effective mind-body intervention. Cognitive behavioral therapy was the only intervention that showed better results than medication. However, considering that only five of the twelve studies chosen reached a score of 3 in the Jadad scale, new studies with a higher methodological quality have to be conducted especially in mind-body interventions that belong to the complementary or alternative medicine field.

21306454	Community vs. institutional elders' evaluations of and preferences for yoga exercises.	AIMS: To evaluate and compare the appropriateness of the Silver Yoga exercise programme for community and institutional elders and to determine their preferences towards yoga exercises. BACKGROUND: Yoga has been used to promote the health of elders. The Silver Yoga was developed to accommodate the physical tolerance and body flexibility of elders and applied to community and institutional elders with positive health promotion benefits. DESIGN: Descriptive design with quantitative programme evaluation and semi-structured interviews. METHOD: A convenience sample of 97 participants (64 community elders; 33 institutional elders) was interviewed individually after six months of Silver Yoga exercises. Participants rated the level of difficulty, acceptability, feasibility and helpfulness of the Silver Yoga programme (four phases: warm-up, hatha yoga, relaxation and guided-imagery meditation) and the abdominal breathing technique, based on a 10-point Cantril ladder scale. Further, participants expressed their preferences of yoga exercises based on four open-ended questions. RESULTS: The programme was fairly acceptable, feasible and helpful for community and institutional elders (means ranged from 8.33-9.70). The warm-up, relaxation, guided-imagery meditation and abdominal breathing are fairly easy to follow and perform (means ranged from 0.20-0.94). However, the postures in hatha yoga phase were relatively challenging but still manageable for the institutional elders (mean = 1.97, SD 2.33). Further, community elders preferred to practise yoga 61-90 minutes everyday in a group of 11-20, while the institutional elders preferred to practise yoga 31-60 minutes three times per week, in a group of <10. CONCLUSIONS: The Silver Yoga exercise programme is acceptable, feasible, helpful and manageable for community and institutional elders. However, different exercise protocols, such as practice intensity and group size, could be applied to different older populations. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The Silver Yoga exercise programme could be applied to both community and institutional elders to promote their health.

21305592	Urinary incontinence among group fitness instructors including yoga and pilates teachers.	AIMS: Controversies exist on the role of physical activity on urinary incontinence (UI), and search on PubMed revealed no studies on UI in fitness instructors. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of UI among female group fitness instructors, including Pilates and yoga teachers. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 1,473 instructors representing three of the largest fitness companies recruited from 59 fitness centers in Norway. They filled in an online survey (Questback) about general health, educational background, and number of hours teaching per week. Prevalence of UI was evaluated by the International Consensus on Incontinence Questionnaire, short form (ICIQ-UI SF). RESULTS: Three out of 152 men (2%) reported UI. Six hundred eighty-five women, mean age 32.7 years (range 18-68) answered the questionnaire. 26.3% of all the female instructors reported to have UI, with 21.4% reporting leakage >/= once a week, 3.2% 2-3 times/week and 1.7% >/= once per day. 24.4% reported the leakage to be small to moderate and the bother score was 4.6 (SD 2.4) out of 21. 15.3% reported leakage during physical activity and 10.9% when coughing/sneezing. 25.9% of yoga and Pilates instructors reported UI. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on UI among fitness instructors and the results indicate that UI is prevalent among female fitness instructors, including yoga and Pilates teachers. More information about this topic seems to be important in the basic education of fitness instructors.	Bo, Kari;Bratland-Sanda, Solfrid;Sundgot-Borgen, Jorunn	2011 Mar
21299296	The invisible benefits of exercise.	OBJECTIVE: To examine whether--and why--people underestimate how much they enjoy exercise. DESIGN: Across four studies, 279 adults predicted how much they would enjoy exercising, or reported their actual feelings after exercising. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Main outcome measures were predicted and actual enjoyment ratings of exercise routines, as well as intention to exercise. RESULTS: Participants significantly underestimated how much they would enjoy exercising; this affective forecasting bias emerged consistently for group and individual exercise, and moderate and challenging workouts spanning a wide range of forms, from yoga and Pilates to aerobic exercise and weight training (Studies 1 and 2). We argue that this bias stems largely from forecasting myopia, whereby people place disproportionate weight on the beginning of a workout, which is typically unpleasant. We demonstrate that forecasting myopia can be harnessed (Study 3) or overcome (Study 4), thereby increasing expected enjoyment of exercise. Finally, Study 4 provides evidence for a mediational model, in which improving people's expected enjoyment of exercise leads to increased intention to exercise. CONCLUSION: People underestimate how much they enjoy exercise because of a myopic focus on the unpleasant beginning of exercise, but this tendency can be harnessed or overcome, potentially increasing intention to exercise.

21294022	What does cancer treatment look like in consumer cancer magazines? An exploratory analysis of photographic content in consumer cancer magazines.	In an exploratory analysis of several highly circulated consumer cancer magazines, the authors evaluated congruency between visual images of cancer patients and target audience risk profile. The authors assessed 413 images of cancer patients/potential patients for demographic variables such as age, gender, and ethnicity/race. They compared this profile with actual risk statistics. The images in the magazines are considerably younger, more female, and more White than what is indicated by U.S. cancer risk statistics. The authors also assessed images for visual signs of cancer testing/diagnosis and treatment. Few individuals show obvious signs of cancer treatment (e.g., head scarves, skin/nail abnormalities, thin body types). Most images feature healthier looking people, some actively engaged in construction work, bicycling, and yoga. In contrast, a scan of the editorial content showed that nearly two thirds of the articles focus on treatment issues. To explicate the implications of this imagery-text discontinuity on readers' attention and cognitive processing, the authors used constructs from information processing and social identity theories. On the basis of these models/theories, the authors provide recommendations for consumer cancer magazines, suggesting that the imagery be adjusted to reflect cancer diagnosis realities for enhanced message attention and comprehension.

21292441	Electronic reminders did not improve postal questionnaire response rates or response times: a randomized controlled trial.	OBJECTIVE: We aim to evaluate the effectiveness of electronic reminders (ERs) to improve the response rates and time to response of postal questionnaires in a health research setting. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: This pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) was nested within a multicenter RCT of yoga for lower back pain. Participants who provided an electronic mail address and/or mobile phone number were randomized to receive an ER or no reminder (controls) on the day they were due to receive a follow-up questionnaire. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-five participants (32 males and 93 females) mean age 46 (standard deviation: 11, range: 20-65) were randomized to ER (n=62) or controls (n=63). Overall 85.6% of participants returned postal questionnaires (87.1% ER group and 84.1% from controls). No significant differences were found between the two groups for response rate (difference between groups=3.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI]=-10, 16; P=0.64) or time to response after adjusting for age, gender, and treatment allocation (chi(2) ([3df])=7.10; P=0.07). CONCLUSION: In the present RCT, we found little evidence for the effectiveness of ERs to increase response rates or time to respond for the return of questionnaires in this study population group.

21285476	Does yoga engender fitness in older adults? A critical review.	Interest in yoga is growing, especially among older adults. This review critically summarizes the current literature to investigate whether physical fitness and function benefits are engendered through the practice of yoga in older adults. A comprehensive search yielded 507 studies; 10 studies with 544 participants (69.6 +/- 6.3 yr, 71% female) were included. Large variability in yoga styles and measurement outcomes make it challenging to interpret results across studies. Studies reported moderate improvements for gait (ES = 0.54, 0.80), balance (ES = 0.25-1.61), upper/lower body flexibility (ES = 0.25, 0.70), lower body strength (ES = 0.51), and weight loss (ES = 0.73, 0.99).Yoga may engender improvements in some components of fitness in older adults. However, more evidence is needed to determine its effectiveness as an alternative exercise to promote fitness in older adults. Further investigation into yoga as an exercise activity for older adults is warranted.	Roland, Kaitlyn P;Jakobi, Jennifer M;Jones, Gareth R	2011 Jan
21280996	Patient disclosure of the use of complementary and alternative medicine to their obstetrician/gynaecologist.	The objective of the study was to determine the extent of complementary and alternative medicine use and the disclosure of that use by patients seeing an obstetrician/gynaecologist. Data from the National Health Interview Survey of the USA 2007 were reviewed. Of the 2,673 women seeing an obstetrician/gynaecologist 956 (35.8%) used at least one form of CAM. However, only 51.8% of the women using CAM disclosed that use to their physician.	Harrigan, J T	2011
21280542	Roles of meditation on alleviation of oxidative stress and improvement of antioxidant system.	According to MEDLINE/Pubmed search to December 2009, the modulation effects of meditation on oxidative stress have been increasingly investigated for acute, short and long-term effects. Both invasive and noninvasive measurements have been utilized. Long-term transcendental and Zen meditators have been showed to diminish oxidative stress seen by a reduction of lipid peroxidation and biophoton emission. Glutathione level and activity of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase) have been facilitated in Yoga and Sudarshan Kriya practitioners. One year of Tai Chi training has been reported to promote superoxide dismutase activity and lessen lipid peroxidation. Performing diaphragmatic breathing after exhaustive exercise has attenuated oxidative stress faster than control. These data suggest possible roles of meditation and meditation-based techniques on the decrease of oxidative stress which may assist to prevent and/or alleviate deterioration of related diseases. However, further research needs to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms which remain challenge to accomplish.	Mahagita, Chitrawina	2010 Nov

23196313	Assessment of use of complementary alternative medicine and its impact on quality of life in the patients attending rheumatology clinic, in a tertiary care centre in India.	PURPOSE: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has witnessed an increase in use in recent times in rheumatological conditions and is expected to have impact on the quality of life (QOL). We had planned to conduct this study to investigate the extent of use of CAM and its effect on QOL of patients at a tertiary care center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethics committee approval was obtained. Sixty patients suffering from osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were enrolled as per the selection criteria, after obtaining their informed consent. Each patient was interviewed for CAM use/non-use, and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) (modified) index for QOL was recorded by the study personnel. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The normality was checked by using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Descriptive statistics was performed and Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare the QOL of CAM users and non-users. RESULTS: Of the 60 patients enrolled with OA (10) and RA (50), 58% (35/60) used CAM. Ayurveda and massage therapy were the commonest [80% (28/35)], followed by yoga asana [34% (12/35)] and homoeopathy [20% (7/35)]. It was observed that combinations of therapies were used too. Nearly half [49% (17/35)] of the CAM users were on self-prescribed medication and 71% (25/35) of them did not inform the physician of CAM use. The QOL of CAM users (WOMAC score: 56.31 +/- 6.82) was better than that of CAM non-users (WOMAC score: 60.16 +/- 4.02) (P value 0.01). CONCLUSION: Patients with RA frequently used CAM and QOL improvised with CAM use. We observed that self-administration of CAM was common and this was not informed to the treating physician.

21274288	Yoga for persistent fatigue in breast cancer survivors: results of a pilot study.	Approximately one-third of breast cancer survivors experiences persistent fatigue for months or years after successful treatment completion. There is a lack of evidence-based treatments for cancer-related fatigue, particularly among cancer survivors. This single-arm pilot study evaluated the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a yoga intervention for fatigued breast cancer survivors based on the Iyengar tradition. Iyengar yoga prescribes specific poses for individuals with specific medical problems and conditions; this trial emphasized postures believed to be effective for reducing fatigue among breast cancer survivors, including inversions and backbends performed with the support of props. Twelve women were enrolled in the trial, and 11 completed the full 12-week course of treatment. There was a significant improvement in fatigue scores from pre- to post-intervention that was maintained at the 3-month post-intervention followup. Significant improvements were also observed in measures of physical function, depressed mood, and quality of life. These results support the acceptability of this intervention and suggest that it may have beneficial effects on persistent post-treatment fatigue. However, results require replication in a larger randomized controlled trial.	Bower, Julienne E;Garet, Deborah;Sternlieb, Beth	2011
21259178	Sensitivity of THOR and Hybrid III dummy lower neck loads to belt systems in frontal impact.	OBJECTIVES: To determine head-neck biomechanics with a focus on lower neck injury metrics in frontal impact. The mid- and large-size Hybrid III dummies and the mid-size Test device for Human Occupant Restraint (THOR) were positioned on a buck. Tests were conducted at low, medium, and high (3.3, 6.7, and 15.7 m/s) change in velocities using 3 restraint types: normal 3-point belt with no pretension (type A), 10-cm pretension (type B), and 200 N pretension (type C). Repeat tests were conducted. Measured vertical and shear forces and sagittal bending moments were evaluated at the upper and lower regions of the neck to different types of belt systems and at different change in velocities. Peak values normalized with respect to the belt type A were used in the comparative analysis. Metrics transformed to the occipital condyles and T1 were also evaluated. RESULTS: All dummies showed good repeatability. Peak measured and transformed upper and lower neck moments were greatest in the large-size dummy. The mid-size Hybrid III dummy responded with greater forces and moments than the THOR. Regardless of dummy type, anthropometry, and velocity, peak lower neck moments were more sensitive to belt types than peak lower neck forces. A similar pattern was apparent for upper neck data. Moments in the THOR were more sensitive than moments in the mid-size Hybrid III dummy. CONCLUSIONS: This study offers quantitative generic restraint-based data and addresses response differences between dummies and dummies of the same family. Because of increased sensitivity to belt types at the upper and lower necks for both forces and moments, the THOR appears to be an improvement to better assess injury potential to rear seat occupants wherein frontal impact air bags do not exist.

21255431	A randomized controlled trial examining Iyengar yoga for young adults with rheumatoid arthritis: a study protocol.	BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, disabling disease that can compromise mobility, daily functioning, and health-related quality of life, especially in older adolescents and young adults. In this project, we will compare a standardized Iyengar yoga program for young people with rheumatoid arthritis to a standard care wait-list control condition. METHODS/DESIGN: Seventy rheumatoid arthritis patients aged 16-35 years will be randomized into either the 6-week Iyengar yoga program (12 - 1.5 hour sessions twice weekly) or the 6-week wait-list control condition. A 20% attrition rate is anticipated. The wait-list group will receive the yoga program following completion of the first arm of the study. We will collect data quantitatively, using questionnaires and markers of disease activity, and qualitatively using semi-structured interviews. Assessments include standardized measures of general and arthritis-specific function, pain, mood, and health-related quality of life, as well as qualitative interviews, blood pressure/resting heart rate measurements, a medical exam and the assessment of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Data will be collected three times: before treatment, post-treatment, and two months following the treatment. DISCUSSION: Results from this study will provide critical data on non-pharmacologic methods for enhancing function in rheumatoid arthritis patients. In particular, results will shed light on the feasibility and potential efficacy of a novel intervention for rheumatoid arthritis symptoms, paving the way for a larger clinical trial.

21244698	Protocol for a randomized controlled study of Iyengar yoga for youth with irritable bowel syndrome.	INTRODUCTION: Irritable bowel syndrome affects as many as 14% of high school-aged students. Symptoms include discomfort in the abdomen, along with diarrhea and/or constipation and other gastroenterological symptoms that can significantly impact quality of life and daily functioning. Emotional stress appears to exacerbate irritable bowel syndrome symptoms suggesting that mind-body interventions reducing arousal may prove beneficial. For many sufferers, symptoms can be traced to childhood and adolescence, making the early manifestation of irritable bowel syndrome important to understand. The current study will focus on young people aged 14-26 years with irritable bowel syndrome. The study will test the potential benefits of Iyengar yoga on clinical symptoms, psychospiritual functioning and visceral sensitivity. Yoga is thought to bring physical, psychological and spiritual benefits to practitioners and has been associated with reduced stress and pain. Through its focus on restoration and use of props, Iyengar yoga is especially designed to decrease arousal and promote psychospiritual resources in physically compromised individuals. An extensive and standardized teacher-training program support Iyengar yoga's reliability and safety. It is hypothesized that yoga will be feasible with less than 20% attrition; and the yoga group will demonstrate significantly improved outcomes compared to controls, with physiological and psychospiritual mechanisms contributing to improvements. METHODS/DESIGN: Sixty irritable bowel syndrome patients aged 14-26 will be randomly assigned to a standardized 6-week twice weekly Iyengar yoga group-based program or a wait-list usual care control group. The groups will be compared on the primary clinical outcomes of irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, quality of life and global improvement at post-treatment and 2-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes will include visceral pain sensitivity assessed with a standardized laboratory task (water load task), functional disability and psychospiritual variables including catastrophizing, self-efficacy, mood, acceptance and mindfulness. Mechanisms of action involved in the proposed beneficial effects of yoga upon clinical outcomes will be explored, and include the mediating effects of visceral sensitivity, increased psychospiritual resources, regulated autonomic nervous system responses and regulated hormonal stress response assessed via salivary cortisol.

21244655	Use of complementary and alternative medicine at Norwegian and Danish hospitals.	BACKGROUND: Several studies have found that a high proportion of the population in western countries use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). However, little is known about whether CAM is offered in hospitals. The aim of this study was to describe to what extent CAM is offered in Norwegian and Danish hospitals and investigate possible changes in Norway since 2001. METHODS: A one-page questionnaire was sent to all included hospitals in both countries. The questionnaire was sent to the person responsible for the clinical activity, typically the medical director. 99 hospitals in the authority (85%) in Norway and 126 in Denmark (97%) responded. Given contact persons were interviewed. RESULTS: CAM is presently offered in about 50% of Norwegian hospitals and one-third of Danish hospitals. In Norway CAM was offered in 50 hospitals, 40 of which involved acupuncture. 19 hospitals gave other alternative therapies like biofeedback, hypnosis, cupping, ear-acupuncture, herbal medicine, art therapy, homeopathy, reflexology, thought field therapy, gestalt therapy, aromatherapy, tai chi, acupressure, yoga, pilates and other. 9 hospitals offered more than one therapy form. In Denmark 38 hospitals offered acupuncture and one Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Light Therapy. The most commonly reported reason for offering CAM was scientific evidence in Denmark. In Norway it was the interest of a hospital employee, except for acupuncture where the introduction is more often initiated by the leadership and is more based on scientific evidence of effect. All persons (except one) responsible for the alternative treatment had a medical or allied health professional background and their education/training in CAM treatment varied substantially. CONCLUSIONS: The extent of CAM being offered has increased substantially in Norway during the first decade of the 21(st) century. This might indicate a shift in attitude regarding CAM within the conventional health care system.

21233170	Different modes of interaction by TIAR and HuR with target RNA and DNA.	TIAR and HuR are mRNA-binding proteins that play important roles in the regulation of translation. They both possess three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) and bind to AU-rich elements (AREs), with seemingly overlapping specificity. Here we show using SPR that TIAR and HuR bind to both U-rich and AU-rich RNA in the nanomolar range, with higher overall affinity for U-rich RNA. However, the higher affinity for U-rich sequences is mainly due to faster association with U-rich RNA, which we propose is a reflection of the higher probability of association. Differences between TIAR and HuR are observed in their modes of binding to RNA. TIAR is able to bind deoxy-oligonucleotides with nanomolar affinity, whereas HuR affinity is reduced to a micromolar level. Studies with U-rich DNA reveal that TIAR binding depends less on the 2'-hydroxyl group of RNA than HuR binding. Finally we show that SAXS data, recorded for the first two domains of TIAR in complex with RNA, are more consistent with a flexible, elongated shape and not the compact shape that the first two domains of Hu proteins adopt upon binding to RNA. We thus propose that these triple-RRM proteins, which compete for the same binding sites in cells, interact with their targets in fundamentally different ways.

21229367	Cost-effectiveness of guideline-endorsed treatments for low back pain: a systematic review.	Healthcare costs for low back pain (LBP) are increasing rapidly. Hence, it is important to provide treatments that are effective and cost-effective. The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of guideline-endorsed treatments for LBP. We searched nine clinical and economic electronic databases and the reference list of relevant systematic reviews and included studies for eligible studies. Economic evaluations conducted alongside randomised controlled trials investigating treatments for LBP endorsed by the guideline of the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society were included. Two independent reviewers screened search results and extracted data. Data extracted included the type and perspective of the economic evaluation, the treatment comparators, and the relative cost-effectiveness of the treatment comparators. Twenty-six studies were included. Most studies found that interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise, acupuncture, spinal manipulation or cognitive-behavioural therapy were cost-effective in people with sub-acute or chronic LBP. Massage alone was unlikely to be cost-effective. There were inconsistent results on the cost-effectiveness of advice, insufficient evidence on spinal manipulation for people with acute LBP, and no evidence on the cost-effectiveness of medications, yoga or relaxation. This review found evidence supporting the cost-effectiveness of the guideline-endorsed treatments of interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise, acupuncture, spinal manipulation and cognitive-behavioural therapy for sub-acute or chronic LBP.

It has a shortage of qualified health workers and the workforce is concentrated in urban areas. Bringing qualified health workers to rural, remote, and underserved areas is very challenging. Many Indians, especially those living in rural areas, receive care from unqualified providers. The migration of qualified allopathic doctors and nurses is substantial and further strains the system. Nurses do not have much authority or say within the health system, and the resources to train them are still inadequate. Little attention is paid during medical education to the medical and public health needs of the population, and the rapid privatisation of medical and nursing education has implications for its quality and governance. Such issues are a result of underinvestment in and poor governance of the health sector--two issues that the government urgently needs to address. A comprehensive national policy for human resources is needed to achieve universal health care in India. The public sector will need to redesign appropriate packages of monetary and non-monetary incentives to encourage qualified health workers to work in rural and remote areas. Such a policy might also encourage task-shifting and mainstreaming doctors and practitioners who practice traditional Indian medicine (ayurveda, yoga and naturopathy, unani, and siddha) and homoeopathy to work in these areas while adopting other innovative ways of augmenting human resources for health. At the same time, additional investments will be needed to improve the relevance, quantity, and quality of nursing, medical, and public health education in the country.

21220085	The role and effect of complementary and alternative medicine in systemic lupus erythematosus.	The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is common among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), especially those with active disease who often have poorer quality of life and significant unmet needs. It is important for the rheumatologist to be aware of these therapies and to ask the patient with SLE about their active use or future interest in CAM. Future studies on the effectiveness of the aforementioned therapies will be crucial to find better ways for the rheumatologist to integrate their use into the care of the patient with SLE.

21220084	Yoga for arthritis: a scoping review.	This article reviews the existing literature on using yoga for arthritis. It includes peer-reviewed research from clinical trials (published from 1980 to 2010) that used yoga as an intervention for arthritis and reported quantitative findings. Eleven studies were identified, including 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 4 non-RCTs. All trials were small and control groups varied. No adverse events were reported, and attrition was comparable or better than that typical for exercise interventions. Evidence was strongest for reduced disease symptoms (tender/swollen joints, pain) and disability and for improved self-efficacy and mental health. Interventions, research methods, and disease diagnoses were heterogeneous.	Haaz, Steffany;Bartlett, Susan J	2011 Feb

21207071	Randomized controlled pilot trial of yoga in overweight and obese breast cancer survivors: effects on quality of life and anthropometric measures.	PURPOSE: To obtain estimates of time to recruit the study sample, retention, facility-based class attendance and home practice for a study of yoga in breast cancer survivors, and its efficacy on fatigue, quality of life (QOL), and weight change. METHODS: Sixty-three post-treatment stages 0-III borderline overweight and obese (body mass index >/= 24 kg/m(2)) breast cancer survivors were randomly assigned to a 6-month, facility- and home-based viniyoga intervention (n = 32) or a waitlist control group (n = 31). The yoga goal was five practices per week. Primary outcome measures were changes in QOL, fatigue, and weight from baseline to 6 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in waist and hip circumference. RESULTS: It took 12 months to complete recruitment. Participants attended a mean of 19.6 classes and practiced at home a mean of 55.8 times during the 6-month period. At follow-up, 90% of participants completed questionnaires and 87% completed anthropometric measurements. QOL and fatigue improved to a greater extent among women in the yoga group relative to women in the control group, although no differences were statistically significant. Waist circumference decreased 3.1 cm (95% CI, -5.7 and -0.4) more among women in the yoga compared with the control group, with no difference in weight change. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides important information regarding recruitment, retention, and practice levels achieved during a 6-month, intensive yoga intervention in overweight and obese breast cancer survivors. Yoga may help decrease waist circumference and improve quality of life; future studies are needed to confirm these results.

21196772	Patterns of mind-body therapies in adults with common neurological conditions.	BACKGROUND: Over 40% of adults with common neurological conditions use complementary and alternative medicine, and mind-body therapies are the most commonly used form. Our objective was to describe mind-body use in adults with common neurological conditions. METHODS: We compared mind-body use between adults with and without common neurological conditions (regular headaches, migraines, back pain with sciatica, strokes, dementia, seizures or memory loss) using the 2007 National Health Interview Survey of 23,393 sampled American adults. RESULTS: Adults with common neurological conditions used mind-body therapies more frequently than those without (24.5 vs. 16.6%, p < 0.0001); differences persisted after adjustment. Deep breathing exercises, meditation and yoga were used most frequently. Nearly 70% of the adults with common neurological conditions did not discuss their mind-body use with their health care provider. Those with neurological conditions used mind-body therapies more than those without these conditions because of provider recommendation (26 vs. 13%) or because conventional treatments were perceived ineffective (12 vs. 4%) or too costly (7 vs. 2%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Mind-body therapies are used more frequently among adults with common neurological conditions, more often when conventional treatments were perceived ineffective. More research is warranted on the efficacy of mind-body use for common neurological conditions.	Erwin Wells, Rebecca;Phillips, Russell S;McCarthy, Ellen P	2011
21194669	Effects of a brief, comprehensive, yoga-based program on quality of life and biometric measures in an employee population: a pilot study.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether a comprehensive, yoga-based wellness program could positively affect multiple markers of health and wellness in an employee population. DESIGN: Self-selected employees who enrolled in a new wellness class were invited to participate in a yoga-based wellness program. Participants met six days per week (Monday through Saturday) at 5:10 am. Sessions lasted for at least one hour, and the program was six weeks long. Each session consisted of power yoga interwoven with philosophical concepts and instruction about the benefits of mindfulness, breath, and meditation. Certain classes each week incorporated large and small group sharing, journal writing, and mindful eating exercises. Main outcome measures were biometric measures (height, weight, blood pressure, flexibility, body fat) and quality-of-life measures (physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being). RESULTS: Fifty-nine employees were invited to join the program; 50 consented to participate, of which 37 (74%) attended more than 90% of classes. Participant age ranged from 24 to 76 years. Statistically significant improvements were observed in weight (-4.84 +/- 5.24 kg; P < .001), diastolic blood pressure (-2.66 +/- 8.31 mm/Hg; P = .03), flexibility score (relative change 11% +/- 20.92; P <.001), body fat percentage (-1.94 +/- 2.68; P < .001), and overall quality of life (linear analog self-assessment [LASA] score 3.73 +/- 8.11; P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that a yoga-based, comprehensive wellness program is both feasible and efficacious in creating positive, short-term improvements in multiple domains of health and wellness for a population of employees.

23353562	Evaluation of a social cognitive theory-based yoga intervention to reduce anxiety.	Yoga is often viewed as a form of alternative and complementary medicine, as it strives to achieve equilibrium between the body and mind that aids healing. Studies have shown the beneficial role of yoga in anxiety reduction. The purpose of this study was to design and evaluate a 10-week social cognitive theory based yoga intervention to reduce anxiety. The yoga intervention utilized the constructs of behavioral capability, expectations, self-efficacy for yoga from social cognitive theory, and included asanas (postures), pranayama (breathing techniques), shava asana (relaxation), and dhyana (meditation). A one-between and one-within group, quasi-experimental design was utilized for evaluation. Scales measuring expectations from yoga, self-efficacy for yoga, and Speilberger's State Trait Anxiety Inventory, were administered before and after the intervention. Repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA) were performed to compare pre-test and post-test scores in the two groups. Yoga as an approach shows promising results for anxiety reduction.

22969180	Integrated yoga therapy for improving mental health in managers.	BACKGROUND: Managers' lives have become a never-ending race against time, technology, and targets. This race creates tension, which leads to dissatisfaction and frustration and eventually manifests itself as psychological and physiological stress with mental and emotional drain. This modern lifestyle intensifies the stress leading to "Excessive Tension" and consequent deterioration in "Executive Efficiency." OBJECTIVE: To assess mental health in managers undergoing yoga-based Self-Management of Excessive Tension (SMET) program. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 72 managers with 48.75+/-3.86 years of mean age were participated in this study of single group pre-post design. The General Health Questionnaire data were taken on the first and sixth day of 5 days SMET program. RESULTS: The data analysis showed 68.25% decrease (P<0.001) in somatic symptoms, 66.29% decrease (P<0.001) in anxiety and insomnia, 65.00% decrease (P<0.001) in social dysfunction, 87.08% decrease (P<0.001) in severe depression, and 71.47% decrease (P<0.001) in all medical complaints. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that participation in a SMET program was associated with improvement in mental health and may have implications for "Executive Efficiency."

22398354	The psychological benefits of yoga practice for older adults: evidence and guidelines.	Yoga is an effective complementary approach to health maintenance and promotion for older adults and has been demonstrated to support many dimensions of psychological wellbeing, from everyday stress to anxiety, depression, and coping with health challenges. Yoga has the potential to be even more effective when consciously and systematically integrated into an individual's overall self-care and medical care program, through deliberate and open dialogue among patients, healthcare professionals, and yoga professionals. The purpose of this article is to (1) briefly review the psychological benefits of yoga practice for older adults; (2) outline practice guidelines for older adult yoga, including key postures; and (3) provide some basic practical guidelines for both healthcare professionals referring patients to yoga and yoga teachers interested in working with older adults.

22398353	Partner yoga for establishing boundaries in relationship: a transpersonal somatic approach.	This article is written for yoga therapists and psychotherapists who work with couples who have difficulty setting boundaries and maintaining individuality in their relationships. Partner yoga, transpersonal psychology, and somatic-based psychology are approaches that can provide clients with a holistic system of therapy to encourage healthy boundaries and emotional connection. The process of partner yoga is described from a transpersonal, somatically oriented approach. Examples of specific asanas, or yoga poses, are discussed alongside the special considerations that a therapist must consider when exploring boundaries and communication through partner yoga. Insights from individual case sessions with couples are included to illustrate the process of differentiation and the possibility of experiencing a transpersonal union through partner yoga.

22398352	A protocol and pilot study for managing fibromyalgia with yoga and meditation.	Fibromyalgia is a chronic syndrome characterized by widespread pain, sleep disturbance, stiffness, fatigue, headache, and mood disorders. Recent research has resulted in an improved understanding of fibromyalgia and its possible causes. This article highlights some of the current research, discusses a strategy for using yoga and meditation as a therapy for fibromyalgia sufferers, and presents the results of a preliminary 8-week study using yoga and meditation to help manage fibromyalgia symptoms. The study of 11 participants found significant improvement in the overall health status of the participants and in symptoms of stiffness, anxiety, and depression. Significant improvements were also seen in the reported number of days "felt good" and number of days "missed work" because of fibromyalgia. Nonsignificant improvements were seen in measures of pain, fatigue, and how one felt in the morning. Effect sizes were medium to large for most tested areas. This study supports the benefits of yoga and meditation for individuals with fibromyalgia and encourages further research to explore their use as standard therapies for fibromyalgia.

22398351	Mass disasters and mind-body solutions: evidence and field insights.	Treatment for the psychological consequences of mass disasters is essential to the recovery of individuals and communities. Little is known about how to provide effective mental health interventions when there are thousands of victims and little, if any, access to care. Post-disaster research and program evaluations suggest that mind-body practices can provide significant relief of anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress, and physical ailments. Mind-body programs are inexpensive, adaptable to different cultures and conditions, and can be taught rapidly to large numbers of people, including community leaders, to create a sustainable resource for local mental health needs. The challenges of doing research in disaster areas are illustrated using examples from field studies. Potential risks of administering programs to vulnerable populations are discussed, with program design recommendations. The development of safe, effective, trauma-sensitive, culturally appropriate, sustainable programs requires research and collaboration among healthcare professionals, mind-body trainers, researchers, academic institutions, government agencies, and non-governmental humanitarian organizations.

22398348	Development of the beliefs about yoga scale.	Beliefs about yoga may influence participation in yoga and outcomes of yoga interventions. There is currently no scale appropriate for assessing these beliefs in the general U.S. population. This study took the first steps in developing and validating a Beliefs About Yoga Scale (BAYS) to assess beliefs about yoga that may influence people's engagement in yoga interventions. Items were generated based on previously published research about perceptions of yoga and reviewed by experts within the psychology and yoga communities. 426 adult participants were recruited from an urban medical center to respond to these items. The mean age was 40.7 (SD=13.5) years. Participants completed the BAYS and seven additional indicators of criterion-related validity. The BAYS demonstrated internal consistency (11 items; alpha=0.76) and three factors emerged: expected health benefits, expected discomfort, and expected social norms. The factor structure was confirmed: x2 (41, n=213)=72.06, p<.001; RMSEA=06, p=.23. Criterion-related validity was supported by positive associations of the BAYS with past experiences and future intentions related to yoga. This initial analysis of the BAYS demonstrated that it is an adequately reliable and valid measure of beliefs about yoga with a three-factor structure. However, the scale may need to be modified based on the population to which it is applied.	Sohl, Stephanie J;Schnur, Julie B;Daly, Leslie;Suslov, Kathryn;Montgomery, Guy H	2011
22398347	Yoga for heart failure patients: a feasibility pilot study with a multiethnic population.	BACKGROUND: Congestive heart failure (CHF) is highly prevalent and the most costly cardiovascular illness in the United States. Yoga is known to be effective in lowering stress, lessening depression, and increasing physical fitness and may be used as an adjuvant management program for CHF patients. PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of a yoga intervention program among a multiethnic CHF population living in underserved neighborhoods. METHODS: Uncontrolled intervention trial. SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Medical Centers, Richmond and Oakland, California. PARTICIPANTS: 14 CHF patients (7 female), mean age 64 (SD=6.4) years, and 62% African-American. INTERVENTION: Eight-week, 2x/week, 1-hr yoga classes that included meditation, breathing exercises, gentle yoga poses, and relaxation. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The intervention feasibility was measured by recruitment rates, participant retention and adherence. Body weight and self-reported depression and quality of life were measured before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Among the 14 patients enrolled, 13 completed the intervention. Of those who completed the trial, 92% attended at least 50% of the classes. There was a significant reduction in weight (-3.5 lb, p=0.01) and improvement in the severity of depression (p<0.05), as well as a trend toward increased quality of life (p=08). No adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial demonstrates that it is feasible for patients with CHF to incorporate yoga into their lifestyle. Yoga may help with routine disease management, prevention of fluid retention, and improvement of depression and quality of life. A larger trial is needed to confirm efficacy and to determine the long-term effects on other important outcomes, such as hospital re-admission rates or prognostic biomarkers.

22398346	Immediate effect of sukha pranayama on cardiovascular variables in patients of hypertension.	UNLABELLED: Hypertension is one of the most common health disorders, and yoga has been shown to be an effective adjunct therapy in its management. Earlier studies have reported blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects of slow, deep breathing after 3 weeks and 3 months of training and beneficial immediate effects of slow, deep breathing in reducing premature ventricular complexes and lowering blood pressure. None of these immediate studies used the concept of pranayama, involving conscious internal awareness of the whole breathing process. This study was undertaken to determine the immediate cardiovascular effects of sukha pranayama in hypertensive patients. METHODS: Twenty-three hypertensive patients attending the Yoga OPD at JIPMER were recruited for the study and instructed to perform sukha pranayama for 5 minutes at the rate of 6 breaths/min. This pranayama involves conscious, slow and deep breathing with equal duration for inhalation and exhalation. Heart rate (HR) and BP were recorded before and immediately after the intervention. RESULTS: Post-intervention statistical analysis revealed a significant (p < .05) reduction in HR and a highly significant (p < .001) reduction in systolic pressure, pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure, rate-pressure product, and double product with an insignificant fall in diastolic pressure. DISCUSSION: It is concluded that sukha pranayama at the rate of 6 breaths/minute can reduce HR and BP in hypertensive patients within 5 minutes of practice. This may be due to a normalization of autonomic cardiovascular rhythms as a result of increased vagal modulation and/or decreased sympathetic activity and improved baroreflex sensitivity. Further studies are required to understand possible mechanisms underlying this beneficial immediate effect and to determine how long such a beneficial effect persists.

22398345	The impact of a short-term iyengar yoga program on the health and well-being of physically inactive older adults.	BACKGROUND: With the current challenge of rapidly aging populations, practices such as yoga may help older adults stay physically active, healthy, and fulfilled. METHODS: The impact of an 8-week Iyengar yoga program on the holistic health and well-being of physically inactive people aged 55 years and over was assessed. Thirty-eight older adults (mean age 73.21+/-8.38 years; 19 intervention, 19 control) engaged in either twice-weekly yoga classes or continued their usual daily routines. Physical health measures were muscle strength, active range of motion, respiratory function (FEV1), resting blood pressure, and immune function (salivary IgA and lysozyme). Self-perceived general, physical, mental, spiritual, and social health and well-being were assessed with the Life's Odyssey Questionnaire and the SF12v2 Health Survey. RESULTS: Muscle strength, active range of motion, physical well-being, and aspects of mental well-being (emotional well-being and self-care) improved significantly in the yoga group (p<.05). Median changes in most of these variables were also significantly different from those in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in Iyengar yoga programs by older people is beneficial for health and well-being, and greater availability of such programs could improve quality of life.

22398344	Influence of Hatha yoga on physical activity constraints, physical fitness, and body image of breast cancer survivors: a pilot study.	Breast cancer survivors often experience changes in their perception of their bodies following surgical treatment. These changes in body image may increase self-consciousness and perceptions of physical activity constraints and reduce participation in physical activity. While the number of studies examining different types of yoga targeting women with breast cancer has increased, studies thus far have not studied the influence that Hatha yoga has on body image and physical activity constraints. The objective of this study was to explore the changes that occur in breast cancer survivors in terms of body image, perceived constraints, and physical fitness following an 8-week Hatha yoga intervention. This study used a nonrandomized two-group pilot study, comparing an 8-week Hatha yoga intervention with a light exercise group, both designed for women who were at least nine months post-treatment for breast cancer. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected in the areas of body image, physical activity constraints, and physical fitness. Findings indicated that quantitatively, yoga participants experienced reductions in physical activity constraints and improvements in lower- and upper-body strength and flexibility, while control participants experienced improvements in abdominal strength and lower-body strength. Qualitative findings support changes in body image, physical activity constraints, and physical fitness for the participants in the yoga group. In conclusion, Hatha yoga may reduce constraints to physical activity and improve fitness in breast cancer survivors. More research is needed to explore the relationship between Hatha yoga and improvements in body image.	Van Puymbroeck, Marieke;Schmid, Arlene;Shinew, Kimberly J;Hsieh, Pei-Chun	2011
22398343	Yoga for women living with breast cancer-related arm morbidity: findings from an exploratory study.	Treatments for breast cancer assault the body and can disrupt the relationship between body, mind, and spirit. In this article, we discuss the ways in which yoga was experienced and understood as a healing therapy among ten female breast cancer survivors between the ages of 26 and 70 and living with treatment-related arm morbidity. The women participated in 6 weekly sessions of gentle Iyengar yoga and responded to open-ended surveys before and after the intervention. The majority of women reported physical, emotional, and spiritual benefits from the practice of yoga. Specific benefits included improvements in physical function and relief from symptoms related to treatment; increased peace of mind and hope; and connection to other yoga participants. Integral to this healing process was social support from other breast cancer survivors.	Thomas, Roanne;Shaw, Rhona M	2011
22398342	Transforming trauma: a qualitative feasibility study of integrative restoration (iRest) yoga Nidra on combat-related post-traumatic stress disorder.	This eight-week study examined the feasibility of offering weekly classes in Integrative Restoration (iRest), a form of mindfulness meditation, to military combat veterans at a community mental health agency in the San Francisco Bay Area. Participants were 16 male combat veterans (15 Vietnam War and 1 Iraq War) of mixed ethnicity, aged 41 to 66 years, suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The 11 participants who completed the study reported reduced rage, anxiety, and emotional reactivity, and increased feelings of relaxation, peace, self-awareness, and self-efficacy, despite challenges with mental focus, intrusive memories, and other concerns. All participants reported they would have attended ongoing iRest classes at the agency approximately once per week.	Stankovic, L	2011

22389788	Multimodal behavior program for ADHD incorporating yoga and implemented by high school volunteers: a pilot study.	A low-cost resource approach to ADHD therapy would be a practical approach to treating children in developing countries. Research has shown that ADHD is prevalent in all areas of the world, and yet treatment for children in more impoverished countries is still lacking. The approach taken was to combine yoga and meditation combined with multimodal behavioral therapy program for children ageing 6 to 11. The program was kept low cost by using trained high school volunteers and integrating the program within the public school. After 6 weeks of the program, 90.5% of children showed improvement as measured by their performance impairment score, a measurement of academic performance. Parent and Teacher evaluations of behavior also found improvement as 25 of the 64 children (39.1%) improved into the normal range as measured by the Vanderbilt questionnaire. Moreover, children could successfully learn both yoga and meditation from high school students irrespective of their age, ADHD type, or initial performance impairment. The results demonstrate efficacy of a multimodal behavioral program incorporating yoga and meditation. The use of high school volunteers from schools in the area demonstrates an effective low-cost and universally applicable approach.

Yoga has historically been viewed as a discipline that increases self-awareness through body based practices, meditation, self-study, and the reading of philosophical texts. In the 21st century the mindfulness techniques of yoga have been adapted as an adjunct to the treatment of individuals with eating disorders. In an effort to understand the conceptualization of yoga as therapy for individuals with eating disorders, this article juxtaposes how mindfulness based yoga is regarded in three disciplines: sociology, neuroscience, and the "spiritual texts" of yoga.

21170232	Immediate effect of two yoga-based relaxation techniques on attention in children.	AIMS: To investigate the effect of two yoga-based relaxation techniques, namely, cyclic meditation (CM) and supine rest (SR), using the six letter cancellation task (SLCT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The subjects consisted of 208 school students, (132 boys, 76 girls) in the age range of 13 - 16 years. The subjects were assessed on SLCT before and immediately after both yoga-based relaxation techniques. RESULTS: After both practices, the total and net scores were significantly increased, although the magnitude of change was more after CM than after SR in the net scores (14.5 versus 11.31%). The net score change in the CM session was significantly larger than the change in the SR, whereas, there was no significant change in the wrong cancellation score. After either practice, the total and net scores were significantly increased, irrespective of gender and age. CONCLUSIONS: Both CM and SR led to improvement in performance, as assessed by SLCT, but the change caused by CM was larger than SR.	Pradhan, Balaram;Nagendra, Hr	2010 Jul
21170231	Impact of yoga way of life on organizational performance.	BACKGROUND: Organizational performance can be attributed to a number of factors. However, there are certain organizational factors, the presence or absence of which can determine the success or failure of the organization. There are different ways in which organizations try to improve their performance by working on such factors. In the research presented in this article, an attempt is made to find out whether adoption of the Yoga Way of Life by managers can have a positive impact on such organizational performance indicators. AIMS: To measure effect of yoga way of life on five different indicators through an empirical study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The five indicators are job satisfaction, job involvement, goal orientation, affective organizational commitment and organizational citizenship behavior. STATISTICS ANALYSIS: Pre- and post-data was measured using self-reported questionnaire. Independent T-test (Paired) and Pearson's correlation test were conducted using SPSS. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The results of the study show that Yoga has a significant positive impact on four out of five of these indicators. Only job involvement does not show significant improvement. The construct used for measuring job involvement had a Chronbach alpha of 0.613, which is an indicator of moderate reliability, which could be the main reason for not getting positive result.

21170230	Does yoga shape body, mind and spiritual health and happiness: Differences between yoga practitioners and college students.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: To assess the body, mind and spirit differences between yoga students compared with college students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mind, body and spirit survey instruments administered to the two groups. RESULTS: Five indicators to measure mental wellness were significantly different between yoga practitioners and college students. On three of these five measures, college students reported more mental wellness than yoga practitioners - in other words, the relationship was the inverse of what was expected. College students reported maintaining stability in their life more often than yoga practitioners as well as more often experiencing satisfying interpersonal relationships. College students were also more likely than yoga practitioners to report being tolerant of others, whether or not they approved of their behavior or beliefs. Yoga practitioners were more likely than college students to report having strong morals and healthy values as well as the ability to express their feelings and consider the feelings of others. We found differences between yoga practitioners and college students on more than half of our spirit items (five of nine). Yoga practitioners were more likely than college students to report expressing their spirituality appropriately and in healthy ways, recognizing the positive contribution faith could make to the quality of life (significant at the 0.07 level), routinely undertaking new experiences to enhance spiritual health and having a positive outlook on life. Further, we found support for the proposition that yoga practitioners were more likely to report experiencing happiness within. CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences between yoga and college students were found on the body, mind and spirit measurement instrument. Further work needs to address the complexities of these relationships.	Monk-Turner, Elizabeth;Turner, Charlie	2010 Jul

CONTEXT: In the aftermath of the Second Lebanon War, a project was initiated and designed to reduce tension in the children living in the area under bombardment. AIMS: To assess the impact of yoga intervention in a group of Israeli school children residing in the region affected by the Second Lebanon War. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The study population included 122 school children aged 8-12 years in two elementary schools in Safed (n=55 and n=67, respectively) and their teachers (n=6). The children attended the third grade (n=28), fourth grade (n=42) and sixth grade (n=52). Inclusion in the study was based on the school principal's consent to participate in the program. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Assessment was conducted using three questionnaires that have been previously validated in international studies and translated to Hebrew. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Statistical analysis of the results included Wilcoxon Signed Ranked Tests for pre- and post-intervention comparisons and the Kruskall-Wallis test for teacher and child cross-comparisons. RESULTS: Based on the questionnaires completed by the children and their teachers, we found that the teachers reported many statistically significant improvements in the children's concentration, mood and ability to function under pressure, although the children themselves were unaware of any change in their behavior. Enjoyment was reported by all participants, and almost all expressed an interest in continuing to practice yoga during school hours. We conclude that participation in yoga classes may be both enjoyable and beneficial to children living in stressful conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that yoga may be beneficial as an intervention for children in postwar stress situations.	Ehud, Miron;An, Bar-Dov;Avshalom, Strulov	2010 Jul
21170228	Brainstem auditory-evoked potentials in two meditative mental states.	CONTEXT: Practicing mental repetition of "OM" has been shown to cause significant changes in the middle latency auditory-evoked potentials, which suggests that it facilitates the neural activity at the mesencephalic or diencephalic levels. AIMS: The aim of the study was to study the brainstem auditory-evoked potentials (BAEP) in two meditation states based on consciousness, viz. dharana, and dhyana. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty subjects were selected, with ages ranging from 20 to 55 years (M=29.1; +/-SD=6.5 years) who had a minimum of 6 months experience in meditating "OM". Each subject was assessed in four sessions, i.e. two meditation and two control sessions. The two control sessions were: (i) ekagrata, i.e. single-topic lecture on meditation and (ii) cancalata, i.e. non-targeted thinking. The two meditation sessions were: (i) dharana, i.e. focusing on the symbol "OM" and (ii) dhyana, i.e. effortless single-thought state "OM". All four sessions were recorded on four different days and consisted of three states, i.e. pre, during and post. RESULTS: The present results showed that the wave V peak latency significantly increased in cancalata, ekagrata and dharana, but no change occurred during the dhyana session. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggested that information transmission along the auditory pathway is delayed during cancalata, ekagrata and dharana, but there is no change during dhyana. It may be said that auditory information transmission was delayed at the inferior collicular level as the wave V corresponds to the tectum.

21168108	Effects of yoga on balance and gait properties in women with musculoskeletal problems: a pilot study.	OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study is to investigate the effects of yoga on balance and gait properties in women with musculoskeletal problems. DESIGN: Twenty-seven women (30-45 years old) with musculoskeletal problems, such as osteoarthritis and low-back pain, were included in the present study. The patients participated in 8 sessions (twice weekly for 4 weeks) of a yoga program which included asanas, stretching exercises, and breathing techniques. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients' static balance measurements and gait parameters were determined before and after the study using a stabilometer and a gait trainer, respectively. RESULTS: Post-study values of patients' gait parameters were found to be statistically higher than their pre-study values (p < 0.05) The values of patients' balance addressed anterior and right positions with patients' eyes open and subsequently closed pre-treatment. However, it was notable that balance post-treatment was minimal when subjects eyes were open or closed. Anterior-posterior values and right-left values were almost equal after treatment. DISCUSSION: The results showed that yoga has a positive effect on balance and gait parameters of women with gait and balance disturbances that are caused by musculoskeletal problems. It is feasible to conclude that asanas and stretching exercises included in the yoga program brought about such a positive effect, and therefore it is possible to use yoga programs to solve problems caused by musculoskeletal disorders.

21168107	Role of naturopathy and yoga treatment in the management of hypertension.	AIM: The primary aim was to study the effect of naturopathy and yoga interventions in treatment of mild to moderate hypertension. DESIGN: The variables of interest were measured at the beginning and end of the intervention using a pre-post design. SETTING: The study was conducted by INYS medical research society in Jindal Nature Cure Institute, Bangalore. SUBJECTS: A total of 104 subjects, already diagnosed with mild to moderate hypertension and on treatment with antihypertensive medicines were included in study. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention consisted of various inpatient administration of different naturopathy treatments, yoga therapies, low calorie and low sodium diet for 21 days. Antihypertensive medicines were withdrawn for some patients in one week based upon response to the treatment. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures were values of diastolic and systolic blood pressure and body weight. Subjects were followed for a period of one year after every 3 months. RESULTS: After starting nonpharmacological approach of naturopathy and yoga, Systolic blood pressure came down from mean of 139.6 to 129.6 where as it came down from 91.2 to 86.1 for diastolic blood pressure. At the same time favorable effect was also seen in other variables like lipid profile and body weight. At the end of one year out of 57 patients who came for follow-up, 14 cases were found to have blood pressure within normal ranges without any medication over the previous 12 months. CONCLUSION: Naturopathy and yoga therapy can be considered as a valuable nonpharmacological approach in treatment of hypertension.	Murthy, S N;Rao, N S N;Nandkumar, Babina;Kadam, Avinash	2011 Feb
21168106	Yoga clinical research review.	In this paper recent research is reviewed on the effects of yoga poses on psychological conditions including anxiety and depression, on pain syndromes, cardiovascular, autoimmune and immune conditions and on pregnancy. Further, the physiological effects of yoga including decreased heartrate and blood pressure and the physical effects including weight loss and increased muscle strength are reviewed. Finally, potential underlying mechanisms are proposed including the stimulation of pressure receptors leading to enhanced vagal activity and reduced cortisol. The reduction in cortisol, in turn, may contribute to positive effects such as enhanced immune function and a lower prematurity rate.	Field, Tiffany	2011 Feb
21167613	Flexibility, functional autonomy and quality of life (QoL) in elderly yoga practitioners.	The aim of this study was to assess the levels of flexibility, functional autonomy and QoL in elderly yoga practitioners. The subjects were divided into a yoga group (YG; n = 52; age = 66.79 +/- 3.30 years; BMI = 24.77 +/- 3.18) and control group (CG; n = 31; age = 69.33 +/- 4.84 years; BMI = 24.32 +/- 3.71) and submitted to flexibility tests through goniometry, the LADEG autonomy protocol and QoL, using the WHOQOL-Old questionnaire. Repeated measures ANOVA showed increases in articular range of motion in shoulder abduction (Delta%SA = 14.11%; p = 0.0001), horizontal shoulder extension (Delta%HSE = 33.90%; p = 0.0001), lumbar spine flexion (Delta%LSF = 50.74%; p = 0.0001), hip flexion (Delta%HF = 35.75%; p = 0.0001), hip extension (Delta%HE = 10.93%; p = 0.021) and knee flexion (Delta%KF = 3.90%; p = 0.001) and in the GDLAM autonomy index (Delta%AI = -13.67%; p = 0.0001) in the YG compared to the CG. The Mann-Whitney test revealed increases in QoL scores in Facet 1 (Delta%Fac1 = 9.04%; p=0.043), Facet 5 (Delta%Fac5 = 51.06%; p = 0.0001) and in overall QoL (Delta%OqoL = 8.13%; p = 0.046) in the YG compared to the CG. The remaining variables showed no significant intergroup modifications. Thus, the study suggests that the regular practice of yoga may lead to improved range of motion in the performance of activities of daily living in elderly women.

21151770	Mind-Body Therapies and Osteoarthritis of the Knee.	Osteoarthritis of the knee is a major cause of disability among adults worldwide. Important treatment options include nonpharmacologic therapies, and especially symptom management strategies in which patients take an active role. Among these, mind-body therapies may have particular promise for alleviating the distressful symptoms associated with osteoarthritis of the knee. However, systematic reviews are lacking. The objective of this paper is to review English-language articles describing clinical studies evaluating the effects of patient-driven mind-body therapies on symptoms of knee osteoarthritis. Eight studies, representing a total of 267 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Interventions included tai chi, qigong, and yoga. Collectively, these studies suggest that specific mind-body practices may help alleviate pain and enhance physical function in adults suffering from osteoarthritis of the knee. However, sample sizes are small, rigorous investigations are few, and the potential benefits of several mind-body therapies have not yet been systematically tested. Additional high-quality studies are needed to clarify the effects of specific mind-body therapies on standardized measures of pain, physical function, and related indices in persons with osteoarthritis of the knee, and to investigate possible underlying mechanisms.

21147813	Impact of relaxation training according to Yoga In Daily Life(R) system on perceived stress after breast cancer surgery.	The purpose of this pilot study was to gather information on the immediate and short-term effects of relaxation training according to Yoga In Daily Life((R)) (YIDL) system on the psychological distress of breast cancer patients. 32 patients at the Institute for Oncology of Ljubljana were randomized to the experimental (N=16) and to the control group (N=16). Both groups received the same standard physiotherapy for 1 week, while the experimental group additionally received a group relaxation training sessions according to YIDL((R)) system. At discharge the experimental group was issued with audiocassette recordings containing the similar instructions for relaxation training to be practiced individually at home (for further 3 weeks). An experimental repeated measures design was used to investigate the differences over 1 month period in stress levels, changes in mental health and psychological parameters. Measures were obtained at three time points during the study period: baseline, at 1 week, and at 4 weeks, by blinded investigators using standardized questionnaires General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12), Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (RSCL) psychological subscale, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Patients who received relaxation training reported feeling significantly less distressed during hospitalization and after discharge-period than did the controls that did not receive relaxation training. The results indicate that relaxation training according to Yoga in Daily Life((R)) system could be useful clinical physiotherapy intervention for breast cancer patients experiencing psychological distress. Although this kind of relaxation training can be applied to clinical oncology in Slovenia, more studies need to be done.	Kovacic, Tine;Kovacic, Miha	2011 Mar
21147424	Osteopathy and (hatha) yoga.	Differences and points of contact between osteopathy and yoga as regards their history and practical application are outlined. Both seek to promote healing. Yoga seeks the attainment of consciousness; osteopathy aims for providing support to health. One fundamental difference is the personal involvement of the individual in yoga. Teacher and student alike are challenged to re-examine the attitudes of mind they have adopted toward their lives. Osteopathy generally involves a relatively passive patient while the osteopath is active in providing treatment. Practical examples are used to highlight points of contact between yoga and osteopathy. The text includes a discussion of the importance of physicality and a description of ways of using it in healing processes. Furthermore, processes of attaining consciousness are outlined. Possible reductionist misconceptions in yoga and osteopathy are also pointed out. Fundamental attitudes and focus that complement each other are presented, taking the concept of stillness as a particular example.	Liem, Torsten	2011 Jan
21146930	Treating fibromyalgia with mindfulness-based stress reduction: results from a 3-armed randomized controlled trial.	Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a structured 8-week group program teaching mindfulness meditation and mindful yoga exercises. MBSR aims to help participants develop nonjudgmental awareness of moment-to-moment experience. Fibromyalgia is a clinical syndrome with chronic pain, fatigue, and insomnia as major symptoms. Efficacy of MBSR for enhanced well-being of fibromyalgia patients was investigated in a 3-armed trial, which was a follow-up to an earlier quasi-randomized investigation. A total of 177 female patients were randomized to one of the following: (1) MBSR, (2) an active control procedure controlling for nonspecific effects of MBSR, or (3) a wait list. The major outcome was health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 2 months post-treatment. Secondary outcomes were disorder-specific quality of life, depression, pain, anxiety, somatic complaints, and a proposed index of mindfulness. Of the patients, 82% completed the study. There were no significant differences between groups on primary outcome, but patients overall improved in HRQoL at short-term follow-up (P=0.004). Post hoc analyses showed that only MBSR manifested a significant pre-to-post-intervention improvement in HRQoL (P=0.02). Furthermore, multivariate analysis of secondary measures indicated modest benefits for MBSR patients. MBSR yielded significant pre-to-post-intervention improvements in 6 of 8 secondary outcome variables, the active control in 3, and the wait list in 2. In conclusion, primary outcome analyses did not support the efficacy of MBSR in fibromyalgia, although patients in the MBSR arm appeared to benefit most. Effect sizes were small compared to the earlier, quasi-randomized investigation. Several methodological aspects are discussed, e.g., patient burden, treatment preference and motivation, that may provide explanations for differences. In a 3-armed randomized controlled trial in female patients suffering from fibromyalgia, patients benefited modestly from a mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention.

21138386	Functional magnetic resonance imaging of hippocampal activation during silent mantra meditation.	OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present study was to investigate whether moderately experienced meditators activate hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex during silent mantra meditation, as has been observed in earlier studies on subjects with several years of practice. METHODS: Subjects with less than 2 years of meditation practice according to the Kundalini yoga or Acem tradition were examined by functional magnetic resonance imaging during silent mantra meditation, using an on-off block design. Whole-brain as well as region-of-interest analyses were performed. RESULTS: The most significant activation was found in the bilateral hippocampus/parahippocampal formations. Other areas with significant activation were the bilateral middle cingulate cortex and the bilateral precentral cortex. No activation in the anterior cingulate cortex was found, and only small activation clusters were observed in the prefrontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the main finding in this study was the significant activation in the hippocampi, which also has been correlated with meditation in several previous studies on very experienced meditators. We propose that the hippocampus is activated already after moderate meditation practice and also during different modes of meditation, including relaxation. The role of hippocampal activity during meditation should be further clarified in future studies, especially by investigating whether the meditation-correlated hippocampal activity is related to memory consolidation.

21135788	'A softening of edges': a comparison of yoga classes at palliative care services in New Delhi and London.	Although the use of yoga as a complementary therapy is common in palliative care, there is little evidence regarding current practice to inform service provision and research. The aim was to explore and compare yoga classes offered by palliative care services in New Delhi and London. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with yoga teachers and participants at two services and analysed thematically. Participants were: in Delhi eight family carers, three patients, and two teachers; in London six patients, one teacher, and one assistant. Six key themes are described: content of classes, symptoms and problems, preconceptions and the meaning of yoga, effects of yoga, challenges, and recommendations. This is the first study to examine the experiences of patients and carers practising yoga in palliative care settings. Recommendations include supporting and educating yoga teachers working with this population, and the need for robust trials.	Selman, Lucy;Higginson, Irene J	2010 Nov
21130360	Ethnic differences in complementary and alternative medicine use among patients with diabetes.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of ethnicity as a predictor of the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) among patients with diabetes. DESIGN AND SETTINGS: A 16-item questionnaire investigating CAM use was distributed among patients attending the Taking Control of Your Diabetes (TCOYD) educational conferences during 2004-2006. Six TCOYD were held across the United States. Information of diabetes status and sociodemographic data was collected. CAM use was identified as pharmacologic (herbs and vitamins) and nonpharmacologic CAMs (e.g., prayer, yoga, and acupuncture). RESULTS: The prevalence of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic CAMs among 806 participants with diabetes patients was 81.9% and 80.3%, respectively. Overall, CAM prevalence was similar for Caucasians (94.2%), African Americans (95.5%), Hispanics (95.6%) and Native Americans (95.2%) and lower in Pacific Islanders/others (83.9%) and Asians (87.8%). Pharmacologic CAM prevalence was positively associated with education (p=0.001). The presence of diabetes was a powerful predictor of CAM use. Several significant ethnic differences were observed in specific forms of CAM use. Hispanics reported using frequently prickly pear (nopal) to complement their diabetes treatment while Caucasians more commonly used multivitamins. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with CAM widely used in persons with diabetes. Ethnic group differences determine a variety of practices, reflecting groups' cultural preferences. Future research is needed to clarify the perceived reasons for CAM use among patients with diabetes in clinical practice and the health belief system associated with diabetes by ethnic group.

21116746	Mind-body therapies in integrative oncology.	There is growing interest in mind-body therapies as adjuncts to mainstream cancer treatment, and an increasing number of patients turn to these interventions for the control of emotional stress associated with cancer. Increased research funding has enabled many such interventions to be evaluated for their efficacy, including studies of mind-body interventions to reduce pain, anxiety, insomnia, anticipatory, and treatment-related nauseas, hot flashes, and improved mood. Mind-body treatments evaluated for their utility in oncology include relaxation therapies, biofeedback, meditation and hypnosis, yoga, art and music therapy, tai chi, and qigong. Although studies are not always methodologically sound and results mixed, a growing number of well-designed studies provide convincing evidence that mind-body techniques are beneficial adjuncts to cancer treatment. The evidence is sufficient to recommend further investigation and adoption of these techniques in mainstream oncology care.	Elkins, Gary;Fisher, William;Johnson, Aimee	2010 Dec
21114828	Large ethnic variations in recommended physical activity according to activity domains in amsterdam, the netherlands.	PURPOSE: The level of recommended physical activity (PA) is met less frequently by people from some ethnic minorities than others. We explored whether these differences in recommended PA between ethnic minority groups and the general population varied by domain and type of culturally-specific activity. METHODS: Participants were sampled from the population based SUNSET study and were from ethnic Dutch (n = 567), Hindustani-Surinamese (n = 370) and African-Surinamese (n = 689) descent. The validated SQUASH-questionnaire measured PA for the following domains: commuting, occupation, household, leisure time. Culturally-specific activities were added as extra question within the leisure time domain. The effect of each domain on ethnic differences in recommended PA prevalence was examined by odds-ratio (OR) analysis through recalculating recommended PA, while, in turn, excluding the contribution of each domain. RESULTS: In the ethnic Dutch population, more vigorous PA in commuting and leisure time was reported compared to the Surinamese groups. The Hindustani-Surinamese and African-Surinamese reported more walking as commuting activity, while the Dutch group reported cycling more frequently. Ethnic differences in recommended PA became smaller in both Surinamese groups compared with the Dutch after removing commuting activity, for example, in Hindustani-Surinamese men (OR = 0.92, 95%CI: 0.62-1.37 vs. OR = 1.33, 0.89-2.00) and women (OR = 1.61, 1.12-2.32 vs. OR = 2.03, 1.41-2.92). Removing occupational activity resulted in larger ethnic differences in both groups compared with the Dutch. Smaller effects were found for yoga and dancing, leisure time and household activities. CONCLUSION: This study shows that differences in PA between ethnic minority groups and the general population vary according to the activity domain. The results indicate that including all relevant domains and activities is essential for assessment of ethnic differences in recommended PA.	de Munter, Jeroen Sl;van Valkengoed, Irene Gm;Agyemang, Charles;Kunst, Anton E;Stronks, Karien	2010 Nov 29
21114406	Efficacy of bolus lukewarm saline and yoga postures as colonoscopy preparation: a pilot study.	BACKGROUND: Colonoscopy is now the gold standard for colon cancer screening and a vital diagnostic and therapeutic tool in 21st century medical practice. Although advances have been swift since colonoscopy came into wide use a generation ago, its effectiveness can be compromised by patients' ability to adequately prepare for the procedure. Many patients dread this task more than the procedure itself. While no prep regimen can be ideal for all patients, the authors present a novel approach that represents a potential time-saving improvement for younger, healthier patients. It is a modern version of an Indian practice called shankh prakshalana, in which lukewarm saline is used in combination with five yoga postures to cleanse the bowel. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of lukewarm saline and yoga (LWS/yoga) as a colonoscopy preparation in comparison with NuLytely((R)) (PEG-3350, sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, and potassium chloride solution) used according to the manufacturer's instructions. RESEARCH DESIGN: This was a pilot study comprising 54 healthy adults, ages 18-65, equally divided into two groups: Group A preparing with lukewarm saline and yoga postures (LWS/yoga); and Group B preparing with NuLytely((R)) as directed on the label. MEASUREMENTS: Data were collected on the quality of bowel preparation, patient safety, patient tolerability, and side-effects. The setting was a Joint Commission accredited outpatient endoscopy clinic. INTERVENTIONS: Patients performed the series of five yoga postures known as shankh prakshalana, interrupting the exercises at regular intervals to consume 480 mL of lukewarm saline. The solution was prepared by adding 9 g of sodium chloride per liter of lukewarm water (99 degrees F-102 degrees F/37.2 degrees C-38.9 degrees C). RESULTS: The mean total score was significantly better in Group A versus Group B (20.63 +/- 5.09 versus 16.48 +/- 5.18, p < 0.0007). In Group A, 24/27 (88.9%) of patients had excellent or optimum total scores, compared with 21/27 (77.8%) in Group B (not significant). In our pilot study, LWS/yoga, used under supervision, produced better colon preparation than Nulytely, used as directed. LIMITATIONS: A randomized, endoscopist-blinded study is needed to confirm these results. CONCLUSIONS: Shankh prakshalana is effective as a colonoscopy preparation.

21093836	Characteristics and predictors of short-term outcomes in individuals self-selecting yoga or physical therapy for treatment of chronic low back pain.	OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical and demographic characteristics of individuals self-selecting yoga or physical therapy (PT) for treatment of chronic low back pain (cLBP) and to examine predictors of short-term pain and functional outcomes. DESIGN: Descriptive, longitudinal study. SETTINGS: A hospital-based clinic that offers modified integral yoga classes for cLBP and 2 outpatient PT clinics that offer exercise-based PT. PARTICIPANTS: Adults (n=53) with cLBP>/=12 weeks: yoga (n=27), PT (n=26). METHODS: Yoga participants attended a 6-week, once weekly, 2-hour yoga class. PT participants underwent twice weekly, 1-hour individualized PT. Data were collected at baseline and at 6 weeks. Groups were compared by using chi2 and independent samples t-tests. Hierarchical linear regression was used to predict treatment outcomes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire), health status (Rand Short Form 36 Health Survey 1.0), pain bothersomeness (numerical rating scale), back pain self-efficacy (Back Pain Self-Efficacy Scale), and treatment satisfaction. RESULTS: At baseline, yoga participants were significantly less disabled (P=.013), had higher health status (P=.023), greater pain self-efficacy (P=.012), and less average pain bothersomeness (P=.001) compared with PT participants. At 6 weeks, when controlling for baseline group differences, greater pain self-efficacy was the strongest predictor for reduced pain and higher function for the entire sample. A significant group interaction by baseline pain self-efficacy predicted disability at 6 weeks. PT participants with low pain self-efficacy reported significantly greater disability than those with high pain self-efficacy. Yoga participants with low and high pain self-efficacy had similar disability outcomes. CONCLUSION: These findings strengthen evidence that self-efficacy is associated with cLBP outcomes, especially in individuals self-selecting PT. Further research to evaluate outcomes after yoga and PT in participants with low pain self-efficacy is needed.

21091294	The effect of trataka, a yogic visual concentration practice, on critical flicker fusion.	OBJECTIVES: The study objective was to study the change in the critical flicker fusion (CFF) after a yogic visual concentration practice (trataka). DESIGN: Thirty (30) subjects participated in a study where they were evaluated for the CFF immediately before and after the practice. The subjects also participated in a comparable control session. SUBJECTS: The subjects were 30 volunteers in the age range 25-40. Fifteen (15) of the volunteers were male. The mean age was 31.33 +/- 4.67. RESULTS: The CFF showed a statistically significant increase from 37.35 +/- 2.84 to 38.66 +/- 2.91 after the yoga practice of trataka. The control session did not produce a statistically significant change in the CFF. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the CFF is seen immediately after the yogic concentration practice called trataka.

21073524	Vertebral artery dissection after iatrogenic cervical subcutaneous emphysema.	We report a case of spontaneous vertebral artery dissection (VAD) in a patient who developed extensive subcutaneous emphysema following the removal of a chest tube after a cardiac transplant. The pathophysiology and management of this uncommon complication are reviewed. Although vertebral and carotid artery dissections are unusual events occurring in 2.5 to 3 per 100,000 people, they are increasingly acknowledged to be important causes of stroke in the young and middle-aged adult population accounting for up to 25% of such cases. VADs are associated with a variety of minor traumatic mechanisms including painting a ceiling, yoga, chiropractic manipulation of the spine, and driving. These events cause injury to the vessel wall either by shearing forces secondary to rotational injuries or direct trauma to the vessel wall on bony prominences, especially the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae. We present a case of a patient with documented previously normal vertebral arterial anatomy who developed a VAD after mediastinal tube removal resulted in subcutaneous emphysema tracking through fascial planes into his neck.

21072305	Management of menopause-associated vasomotor symptoms: Current treatment options, challenges and future directions.	Hot flashes are one of the most common and distressing symptoms associated with menopause, occurring in more than 75% of postmenopausal women. They are especially problematic in breast cancer patients since some breast cancer therapies can induce hot flashes. For mild hot flashes, it is proposed that behavioral modifications are the first step in management. Hormonal therapies, including estrogens and progestogens, are the most well known effective agents in relieving hot flashes; however, the safety of these agents is controversial. There is an increasing amount of literature on nonhormonal agents for the treatment of hot flashes. The most promising data regard newer antidepressant agents such as venlafaxine, which reduces hot flashes by about 60%. Gabapentin is another nonhormonal agent that is effective in reducing hot flashes. While many complimentary therapies, including phytoestrogens, black cohosh, and dehydroepiandrosterone, have been explored for the treatment of hot flashes; none can be recommended at this time. Furthermore, there is a lack of strong evidence to support exercise, yoga, or relaxation for the treatment of hot flashes. Paced respirations and hypnosis appear to be promising enough to warrant further investigation. Another promising nonpharmacological therapy, currently under investigation, involves a stellate ganglion block.	Pachman, Deirdre R;Jones, Jason M;Loprinzi, Charles L	2010 Aug 9

21058970	Yoga for chronic pain management: a qualitative exploration.	OBJECTIVE: To explore patients' perceptions of their pain while participating in a weekly yoga program. METHODS: A consecutive convenience sample was recruited from a Multidisciplinary Pain Centre. Seven adult patients (six women), agreed to participate in an 8-week Hatha yoga program, including weekly group sessions and at-home practice. Data were gathered from participant observation and in-depth interviews. Interviews explored the experience of practicing yoga and its relationship to the participant's pain experience. An inductive analysis of the interviews explored emergent themes from participants' descriptions of their experience. RESULTS: Analyses identified three themes: renewed awareness of the body; transformed relationship with the body in pain; and acceptance. DISCUSSION: Participants' data suggested that they reframed what it meant to live with chronic pain. Some participants reported that the sensory aspects of pain did not change but that pain became less bothersome. They were better able to control the degree to which pain interfered with their daily life. Other participants reported less frequent or less intense pain episodes because they could recognize body signals and adjust themselves to alleviate painful sensations. The findings suggest that patients who benefit from yoga may do so in part because yoga enables changes in cognitions and behaviours towards pain.	Tul, Yvonne;Unruh, Anita;Dick, Bruce D	2011 Sep

OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among women in the United States is high. Little is known about how CAM use may differ based on sexual orientation. Study aims were to measure the prevalence of CAM use in a community sample of women, explore differences in CAM use patterns by sexual orientation, and identify correlates of CAM use. DESIGN/SUBJECTS: Analyses were based on women (Total N = 879; n = 479 lesbians) enrolled in the Epidemiologic STudy of HEalth Risk in Women (ESTHER) Project, a cross-sectional heart-disease risk-factor study. SETTINGS/LOCATION: Data were collected through convenience sampling of adult females in Pittsburgh, PA (2003-2006). OUTCOME MEASURES: Main outcome measures included lifetime and past 12-month CAM use, and types of CAM modalities used in the past 12 months. RESULTS: The prevalence of having ever used CAM was 49.8%, with 42% having reported CAM use within the past 12 months. Lesbians had greater odds of having ever used CAM (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.68 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.23, 2.28]) and of having used CAM in the past 12 months (AOR = 1.44 [CI: 1.06, 1.97]) than heterosexuals. In multivariate analyses, correlates of lifetime and past 12-month CAM use included being lesbian, white, higher educated, and a large-city resident; experiencing perceived discrimination in a health care setting; and having a greater spirituality rating and a history of a diagnosed mental health disorder. Past 12-month CAM use was also associated with having a provider of usual health care. Among women who used CAM within the past 12 months, heterosexuals had significantly higher yoga participation rates than lesbians. CONCLUSIONS: Sexual orientation is important in understanding lifetime and past 12-month CAM use. Because of the high prevalence of CAM use found in this study, medical practitioners should inquire about the CAM practices of female patients, particularly lesbians.

21048431	Effect of yoga in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.	Yoga is adjunctively utilized outside the United States in the treatment of a variety of diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but there are no studies assessing its adjunctive efficacy in the United States. We prospectively evaluated the effects of yoga training on the quality of life (QOL) and the parameters of lung function in patients with COPD. Thirty-three patients with documented COPD, per Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease criteria, were recruited. All patients received standard COPD care. The QOL was assessed by the St. George Respiratory questionnaire. Standard spirometry and maximum inspiratory (maximal inspiratory pressure) and expiratory pressure (maximal expiratory pressure) were measured. Patients were taught selected yoga exercises including breathing exercises, meditation, and yoga postures for 1 hour, thrice a week for 6 weeks by a certified yoga therapist. The quality of life and lung function were again assessed at the end of 6 weeks. Twenty-two patients completed the study. Differences in preyoga versus postyoga scores were evaluated using paired t-tests. Statistically significant improvements (P < 0.05) were observed for the St. George Respiratory questionnaire [95% confidence interval (CI) 43.13-58.47], vital capacity (95% CI 2.53-7.65), maximal inspiratory pressure (95% CI 6.62-23.64), and maximal expiratory pressure (95% CI 1.63-13.81). Yoga when practiced by patients with COPD results in improvement in the QOL and lung function on a short-term basis. Additional research is needed to confirm these findings in a randomized controlled trial and in the longer term.

21047288	Effect of a yoga programme on an individual with Parkinson's disease: a single-subject design.	PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of eight weekly yoga sessions on balance, mobility and reported quality of life of an individual with Parkinson's disease (PD). Furthermore, to test the methodology in order to inform future research. METHOD: A 69-year-old female with an 8-year history of PD (Hoehn and Yahr rating two) was selected for the study, which had a single subject ABA design. A 1-week baseline was followed by an 8-week period of weekly 60 min yoga classes and a further 5 weeks of treatment withdrawal. Main outcome measures used were Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Timed Up and Go (TUG) and the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39); collected at baseline, before, during and after the intervention and at follow-up. RESULTS: An improvement was noted in the BBS and TUG during the intervention phase; although these changes did not appear to be clinically significant. No change in quality of life as measured by the PDQ-39 was noted. CONCLUSIONS: The objective improvements in functional activities during the intervention period were not clinically significant. Subjectively, the participant gained much enjoyment and relaxation from the yoga classes. This study justifies the need for further studies using a larger sample size. Additionally, it will inform the methodological design.	Hall, Emma;Verheyden, Geert;Ashburn, Ann	2011

21046920	Effect of yoga on pulmonary function tests of hypothyroid patients.	Aim of this study was to see any effect on respiratory functions in hypothyroid patients after pranayama (yoga). The subjects for the study were 20 hypothyroid females, 39.70 +/- 8.27 years of mean age referred from medicine department of UCMS & G.T.B. Hospital. Spiro metric recordings were taken with hypair (version-1.28). Baseline (first) recordings were taken when patient came for the first time. Patients came to yoga lab in physiology department for 21 days continuously where they were trained by the yoga instructors and then told to do pranayama at home and called at regular intervals after 7 days to see the compliance. The breathing exercises were done for 45 minutes everyday. After 6 months of pranayama second recording was taken and compared with the baseline. There were significant improvement in forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV1), Maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) and Inspiratory Capacity(IC). Thus Pranayama and meditation has beneficial effect on pulmonary functions of hypothyroid patients along with conventional treatment.	Swami, Gaurav;Singh, Savita;Singh, K P;Gupta, Manish	2010 Jan-Mar
21040884	Predictors of yoga use among patients with breast cancer.	OBJECTIVE: Emerging research suggests that yoga may be beneficial for reducing symptoms and improving quality of life among breast cancer patients. However, very little is known about the characteristics of breast cancer patients who use yoga; thus, this study seeks to identify the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of yoga users among this population. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey study was conducted. SETTING: The study was conducted at an outpatient breast oncology clinic at a large university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred postmenopausal breast cancer patients currently receiving aromatase inhibitors were included in this study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: Self-reported use of yoga following the cancer diagnosis was collected along with sociodemographic and clinical data. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of yoga use among breast cancer patients. RESULTS: Of 300 participants, 53 (17.7%) reported having used yoga following cancer diagnosis. White patients were significantly more likely to use yoga than nonwhite patients (P = .02). Higher education level, lower BMI (body mass index), part-time employment status, previous chemotherapy, and radiation therapy were all associated with greater yoga use (all P < .05). Controlling for other factors, greater yoga use was independently associated with higher education level (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.72, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-6.46), and lower BMI (AOR 0.25, 95% CI, 0.09-0.66). CONCLUSION: Yoga use following breast cancer diagnosis was substantially higher for white patients and those with lower BMI and higher education levels. Considering its potential benefits for symptom management in cancer, more research is needed to understand the attitudes and barriers to yoga use among individuals with nonwhite race, lower education, and higher BMI level. Such investigation will help design yoga programs that are aligned to the needs of these populations.

20977960	The role of exercise and alternative treatments for low back pain.	The determination of whether a patient should pursue an active or passive treatment program is often made by medical practitioners. Knowledge about all forms of treatment, including complementary and alternative (CAM) treatments, is essential in the treatment of low back pain. Medical practitioner-directed active treatments that have been shown to be effective for the treatment of low back pain include physical therapy-directed exercise programs such as core stabilization and mechanical diagnosis and therapy (MDT). Based on the current literature, it appears that yoga is the most effective nonphysician-directed active treatment approach to nonspecific low back pain when comparing other CAM treatments. Acupuncture is a medical practitioner-directed passive treatment that has been shown to be a good adjunct treatment. More randomized controlled studies are needed to support both CAM treatments and exercise in the treatment of low back pain.	Carneiro, Kevin A;Rittenberg, Joshua D	2010 Nov
20977037	The Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction program (MBSR) reduces stress-related psychological distress in healthcare professionals.	This semi-experimental study examines how Mindfulness facilitates a distress reduction in a group of health professionals. The sample comprises 29 professionals seeking stress reduction who undertook an 8 weeks psico-educative intervention, involving 28 hours of class, based on a program called Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction or MBSR. Results show a 35% reduction of distress, from percentile 75 to 45, combined with a 30% reduction in rumination and a 20% decrease in negative affect. These benefits lasted during the 3 months of the follow up period. The correlation analysis indicates that the decrease in distress is significantly related to the other two variables. These results confirm the effectiveness of MBSR to decrease distress and its applicability in training programs for health professionals.	Martin-Asuero, Andres;Garcia-Banda, Gloria	2010 Nov
20976480	Do dietary spices impair the patient-reported outcomes for stapled hemorrhoidopexy? A randomized controlled study.	BACKGROUND: Postoperative pain is a concern for patients seeking hemorrhoid surgery. Stapled hemorrhoidopexy is popular due to better patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Pain is the index of PROs. Posthemorrhoidectomy patients usually opt for a spice-free diet due to fear of pain or anal pruritus induced by spices. Curcumin and peprin (spice constituents) have powerful antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties. Ability to resume a normal taste-habituated meal may improve PRO quality of life. Thus, spice-related paradoxic conservatism in stapled hemorrhoidopexy, which involves no open wound, needed to be studied. METHODS: A prospective open-ended study (July 2008 to August 2009) investigated consecutive candidates for day-care stapled hemorrhoidopexy randomized by the date of birth method into a controlled group (receiving a spices-free diet) and a study group (receiving a spicy diet) after an ethics and informed consent protocol. A standard perioperative protocol was followed. At discharge, the patients were advised to resume a normal diet (spicy or bland) and instructed to maintain a pain diary (100-point visual analog scale [VAS]) and an analgesic diary. Paracetamol 650 mg was used for pain exceeding a VAS score of 25. Patients were followed on day 3 and weeks 1 and 3. Failure to be discharged from day care, failure to maintain patient diary, and squamous epithelium in the rectal donut were the withdrawal criteria. RESULTS: A total of 67 patients were randomized. The groups were well matched for demographics, comorbidities, types of anesthesia, hemorrhoidal grades, and withdrawal. Statistically significant improvement in PROs (P<0.05) and a lower consumption of analgesic tablets were seen in the study group (spicy diet). No adverse event was reported in either group. CONCLUSION: Resumption of a spicy diet has no adverse impact on PROs after stapled hemorrhoidopexy. Reduced analgesic usage in the spicy diet study group needs to be evaluated further for any potential benefits of spices.	Agarwal, Brij B	2011 May
20965131	A systematic review of insomnia and complementary medicine.	In concert with growing public interest in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), these therapies and products have been increasingly studied over the past two decades for the treatment of sleep disorders. While systematic reviews have been conducted on acupuncture and valerian in the treatment of insomnia, to date no comprehensive review has been conducted on all major CAM treatments. We sought to address this via a rigorous systematic review of hypnotic CAM interventions, including herbal and nutritional medicine, acupuncture, acupressure, yoga, tai chi, massage, aromatherapy and homoeopathy. The electronic databases MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL, PsycINFO, and The Cochrane Library were accessed during late 2009 for CAM randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the treatment of chronic insomnia. Sixty-four RCTs were identified, of which 20 studies involving eight CAM interventions met final inclusion criteria. Effect size calculations (where possible) and a quality control analysis using a modified Jadad scale were undertaken. Many RCTs lacked methodological rigor, and were commonly excluded due to small sample size or an inadequate control condition. Among the studies that met inclusion criteria, there was evidentiary support in the treatment of chronic insomnia for acupressure (d=1.42-2.12), tai chi (d=0.22-2.15), yoga (d=0.66-1.20), mixed evidence for acupuncture and L-tryptophan, and weak and unsupportive evidence for herbal medicines such as valerian. Surprisingly, studies involving several mainstream CAM therapies (e.g., homoeopathy, massage, or aromatherapy) were not located or did not meet basic inclusion criteria. If CAM interventions are to be considered as viable stand-alone or adjuvant treatments for sleep disorders, future researchers are urged to use acceptable methodology, including appropriate sample sizes and adequate controls. RCTs evaluating other untested CAM therapies such as massage, homoeopathy, or osteopathy are encouraged, as is the exploration of using CAM therapies adjuvantly with conventional therapies.

20960557	Mechanisms of yogic practices in health, aging, and disease.	Mechanisms underlying the modulating effects of yogic cognitive-behavioral practices (eg, meditation, yoga asanas, pranayama breathing, caloric restriction) on human physiology can be classified into 4 transduction pathways: humoral factors, nervous system activity, cell trafficking, and bioelectromagnetism. Here we give examples of these transduction pathways and how, through them, yogic practices might optimize health, delay aging, and ameliorate chronic illness and stress from disability. We also recognize that most studies of these mechanisms remain embedded in a reductionist paradigm, investigating small numbers of elements of only 1 or 2 pathways. Moreover, often, subjects are not long-term practitioners, but recently trained. The models generated from such data are, in turn, often limited, top-down, without the explanatory power to describe beneficial effects of long-term practice or to provide foundations for comparing one practice to another. More flexible and useful models require a systems-biology approach to gathering and analysis of data. Such a paradigm is needed to fully appreciate the deeper mechanisms underlying the ability of yogic practice to optimize health, delay aging, and speed efficient recovery from injury or disease. In this regard, 3 different, not necessarily competing, hypotheses are presented to guide design of future investigations, namely, that yogic practices may: (1) promote restoration of physiologic setpoints to normal after derangements secondary to disease or injury, (2) promote homeostatic negative feedback loops over nonhomeostatic positive feedback loops in molecular and cellular interactions, and (3) quench abnormal "noise" in cellular and molecular signaling networks arising from environmental or internal stresses.

20953711	Anasakti, the Hindu ideal, and its relationship to well-being and orientations to happiness.	Anasakti, a Sanskrit term for traits like non-attachment, equipoise, selfless duty orientation, and effort in the absence of concern for the outcome, can be regarded as a Hindu-ideal cluster of personality traits. The relationship of Anasakti with well-being and the three distinct happiness orientations was explored through a study of 676 college students and a sample of 65 yogic practitioners in India. The findings revealed that the yogic practitioners were markedly higher in Anasakti than the secular population. For the yogic population, there was a large correlation between Anasakti and the Orientation to Meaningful Life, and it accounted for more than 20% of the variance in the regression of Anasakti against all the measures of well-being. The yogic population's scores also correlated with several other measures of well-being. The scores of the secular population were less strongly related to the well-being scores; though, several correlation coefficients were statistically significant.	Banth, Sudha;Talwar, Charu	2012 Sep
20953427	Inner Correspondence and Peacefulness with Practices among Participants in Eurythmy Therapy and Yoga: A Validation Study.	Several mind body medicine interventions require an active participation of the practitioners. We intended to develop a questionnaire to operationalize and measure the "inner correspondence" of individuals practicing Yoga or Eurythmy Therapy. In an anonymous cross-sectional study we enrolled 501 individuals (61% yoga). Exploratory factor analysis (study 1) of the 12-item instrument (Cronbach's alpha = .84) pointed to a 3-factor solution, with one major scale and good internal consistency (alpha = .83) and two minor scales with weak internal consistency. To improve the quality of the main scale, we added 8 new items which were tested in a sample of 135 individuals (study 2: 71% Yoga). Factor analysis confirmed a 12-item single factor (alpha = .95), that is, Inner Correspondence/Peaceful Harmony with Practices (ICPH). The scale correlated strongly with mindfulness (FMI; r > .50), moderately with life and patient satisfaction (BMLSS; r between .32 and .43), and weakly negative with symptom score (VAS; r = -.23). In conclusion, the scale ICPH was confirmed as a relevant tool to measure the inner correspondence and feelings of peacefulness with practices. It can be used in clinical studies to assess the efficacy of mind-body practices involving physical movements.

20948898	Application of integrated yoga therapy to increase imitation skills in children with autism spectrum disorder.	BACKGROUND/AIM: Children with autism exhibit significant deficits in imitation skills, which impede the acquisition of more complex behavior and socialization. Imitation is often targeted early in intervention plans and continues to be addressed throughout the child's treatment. The use of integrated approach to yoga therapy (IAYT) as a complementary therapy for children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is rarely reported and little is known on the effectiveness of such therapies. This study investigated IAYT as a treatment method with children with ASD to increase imitative skills. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Parents and six children with ASD participated in a 10-month program of 5-weekly sessions and regular practice at home. Pre, mid and post treatment assessments included observers and parent ratings of children's imitation skills in tasks related to imitation skills such as gross motor actions, vocalization, complex imitation, oral facial movements and imitating breathing exercises. RESULTS: Improvement in children's imitation skills especially pointing to body, postural and oral facial movements. Parents reported change in the play pattern of these children with toys, peers and objects at home. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that IAYT may offer benefits as an effective tool to increase imitation, cognitive skills and social-communicative behaviors in children with ASD. In addition, children exhibited increased skills in eye contact, sitting tolerance, non-verbal communication and receptive skills to verbal commands related to spatial relationship.

20948897	Complimentary effect of yogic sound resonance relaxation technique in patients with common neck pain.	BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that conventional treatment methods with drugs, physiotherapy and exercises for common neck pain (CNP) may be inadequate. Yoga techniques have been found to be effective complimentary therapies in chronic low back pain and also for stress reduction in other diseases. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to examine the complimentary role of a yogic relaxation called mind sound resonance technique (MSRT) in non-surgical management of CNP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized controlled study, 60 patients with CNP were assigned to two groups (yoga, n=30) and (control, n=30). The yoga group received yogic MSRT for 20 minutes in supine position after the conventional physiotherapy program for 30 minutes using pre-recorded audio CD and the control group had non-guided supine rest for 20 minutes (after physiotherapy), for 10 days. MSRT provides deep relaxation for both mind and body by introspective experience of the sound resonance in the whole body while repeating the syllables A, U, M and Om and a long chant (Mahamrityunjaya mantra) several times in a meaningful sequence. Both the groups had pre and post assessments using visual pain analog scale, tenderness scoring key, neck disability score (NDS) questionnaire, goniometric measurement of cervical spinal flexibility, and state and trait anxiety inventory-Y1 (STAI-Y1). RESULTS: Mann-Whitney U test showed significant difference between groups in pain (P<0.01), tenderness (P<0.01), neck movements (P<0.01). NDS (P<0.01) and state anxiety (STAI-Y1) showed higher reduction in yoga (P<0.01) than that in the control group. Wilcoxon's test showed a significant improvement in both groups on all variables (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Yoga relaxation through MSRT adds significant complimentary benefits to conventional physiotherapy for CNP by reducing pain, tenderness, disability and state anxiety and providing improved flexibility.

20948896	Effect of yoga on quality of life of CLBP patients: A randomized control study.	CONTEXT: In two of the earlier Randomized Control Trials on yoga for chronic lower back pain (CLBP), 12 to 16 weeks of intervention were found effective in reducing pain and disability. AIM: To study the efficacy of a residential short term intensive yoga program on quality of life in CLBP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: About 80 patients with CLBP (females 37) registered for a week long treatment at SVYASA Holistic Health Centre in Bengaluru, India. They were randomized into two groups (40 each). The yoga group practiced a specific module for CLBP comprising of asanas (physical postures), pranayama (breathing practices), meditation and lectures on yoga philosophy. The control group practiced physical therapy exercises for back pain. Perceived stress scale (PSS) was used to measure baseline stress levels. Outcome measures were WHOQOL Bref for quality of life and straight leg raising test (SLR) using a Goniometer. RESULTS: There were significant negative correlations (Pearson's, P<0.005, r>0.30) between baseline PSS with all four domains and the total score of WHOQOLBref. All the four domains' WHOQOLBref improved in the yoga group (repeated measures ANOVA P=0.001) with significant group*time interaction (P<0.05) and differences between groups (P<0.01). SLR increased in both groups (P=0.001) with higher increase in yoga (31.1 % right, 28.4 % left) than control (18.7% right, 21.5 % left) group with significant group*time interaction (SLR right leg P=0.044). CONCLUSION: In CLBP, a negative correlation exists between stress and quality of life. Yoga increases quality of life and spinal flexibility better than physical therapy exercises.

20948895	Measures of heart rate variability in women following a meditation technique.	Certain time domain, frequency domain and a nonlinear measure of heart rate variability are studied in women following a meditative practice called cyclic meditation. The nonlinear measure studied is the sampling entropy. We show that there is an increase in the sampling entropy in the meditative group as compared to the control group. The time domain measure called pNNx is shown to be useful in distinguishing between the meditative state and a normal resting state.	An, Hyorim;Kulkarni, Ravi;Nagarathna, R;Nagendra, Hr	2010 Jan
20948894	Meditation on OM: Relevance from ancient texts and contemporary science.	BACKGROUND: In Indian scriptures the sacred syllable Om is the primordial sound from which all other sounds and creation emerge which signifies the Supreme Power. AIMS: To explore the significance of the syllable OM from ancient texts and effects of OM meditation in contemporary science. DESCRIPTIONS FROM ANCIENT TEXTS: The descriptions of Om have been taken from four Upanisads (Mundaka, Mandukya, Svetasvatara, and Katha), the Bhagvad Gita, and Patanjali's Yoga Sutras. SCIENTIFIC STUDIES ON OM: Autonomic and respiratory studies suggest that there is a combination of mental alertness with physiological rest during the practice of Om meditation. Evoked potentials studies suggest a decrease in sensory transmission time at the level of the auditory association cortices, along with recruitment of more neurons at mesencephalic-diencephalic levels. CONCLUSIONS: It is considered that a person who realizes Om, merges with the Absolute. Scientific studies on Om suggest that the mental repetition of Om results in physiological alertness, and increased sensitivity to sensory transmission.

20946990	A pilot randomized controlled trial of the Yoga of Awareness program in the management of fibromyalgia.	A mounting body of literature recommends that treatment for fibromyalgia (FM) encompass medications, exercise and improvement of coping skills. However, there is a significant gap in determining an effective counterpart to pharmacotherapy that incorporates both exercise and coping. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the effects of a comprehensive yoga intervention on FM symptoms and coping. A sample of 53 female FM patients were randomized to the 8-week Yoga of Awareness program (gentle poses, meditation, breathing exercises, yoga-based coping instructions, group discussions) or to wait-listed standard care. Data were analyzed by intention to treat. At post-treatment, women assigned to the yoga program showed significantly greater improvements on standardized measures of FM symptoms and functioning, including pain, fatigue, and mood, and in pain catastrophizing, acceptance, and other coping strategies. This pilot study provides promising support for the potential benefits of a yoga program for women with FM.

20938610	Comparison of fracture patterns between rural and urban populations in a developing country.	INTRODUCTION: The pattern of fracture, including the anatomical location and age distribution, may differ among urban and rural populations due to various factors such as the inhabitants' occupation and living environment. METHODS: This was a retrospective multicentre study involving two urban and three rural hospitals in Malaysia. The demographic data and anatomical location of fracture of patients admitted in 2007 were collected for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 7,973 patients were admitted for fractures between January and December 2007. The femur was the commonest fracture site that required admission in the urban population (21.9 percent), followed by the tibia-fibula (18.7 percent), while the radius-ulna was the commonest site among the rural population (22.0 percent), followed by the tibia-fibula (19.4 percent). The rates of head and pelvic fractures were comparatively higher in the urban population, while hand fractures were more common in the rural population. The higher rate of femur fracture in the urban group, especially among the elderly, may be due to the higher incidence of osteoporosis or a higher proportion of older people in the population. CONCLUSION: The anatomical locations of common fractures differed between the urban and rural populations. A higher rate of upper limb fractures was observed in the rural areas, while femur fractures in the elderly was the main cause of fracture admission in the urban areas. The relatively high rate of hand fractures in the rural areas, especially among children and young adults, may require further investigation.

20920810	Tai chi/yoga effects on anxiety, heartrate, EEG and math computations.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the immediate effects of a combined form of Tai chi/yoga. DESIGN: 38 adults participated in a 20-min Tai chi/yoga class. The session was comprised of standing Tai chi movements, balancing poses and a short Tai chi form and 10 min of standing, sitting and lying down yoga poses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The pre- and post- Tai chi/yoga effects were assessed using the State Anxiety Inventory (STAI), EKG, EEG and math computations. RESULTS: Heartrate increased during the session, as would be expected for this moderate-intensity exercise. Changes from pre to post-session assessments suggested increased relaxation including decreased anxiety and a trend for increased EEG theta activity. CONCLUSIONS: The increased relaxation may have contributed to the increased speed and accuracy noted on math computations following the Tai chi/yoga class.

20920800	A randomised controlled trial of yoga for the treatment of chronic low back pain: results of a pilot study.	OBJECTIVE: To conduct a pilot trial of yoga for the treatment of chronic low back pain (LBP) to inform the feasibility and practicality of conducting a full-scale trial in the UK; and to assess the efficacy of yoga for the treatment of chronic low back pain. DESIGN: A pragmatic randomised controlled trial was undertaken comparing yoga to usual care. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty participants who had presented to their GP with chronic low back pain in the previous 18 months were recruited via GP records from one practice in York, UK. INTERVENTIONS: Twenty patients were randomised to either 12 weekly 75-min sessions of specialised yoga plus written advice, or usual care plus written advice. Allocation was 50/50. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recruitment rate, levels of intervention attendance, and loss to follow-up were the main non-clinical outcomes. Change as measured by the Roland and Morris disability questionnaire was the primary clinical outcome. Changes in the Aberdeen back pain scale, SF-12, EQ-5D, and pain self-efficacy were secondary clinical outcomes. Data were collected via postal questionnaire at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 286 patients identified from the GP database, 52 (18%) consented and returned the eligibility questionnaire, out of these 20 (6.9%) were eligible and randomised. The total percentage of patients randomised from the GP practice population was 0.28%. Ten patients were randomised to yoga, receiving an average of 1.7 sessions (range 0-5), and 10 were randomised to usual care. At 12 weeks follow-up data was received from 60% of patients in the yoga group and 90% of patients in the usual care group (75% overall). No significant differences were seen between groups in clinical outcomes apart from on the Aberdeen back pain scale at four weeks follow-up where the yoga group reported significantly less pain. CONCLUSION: This pilot study provided useful data and information to inform the design and development of a full-scale trial of yoga for CLBP in the UK. A key finding is the calculation of GP practice total list size required for patient recruitment in a full-scale trial, and the need to implement methods to increase class attendance.

20890950	Living AnatoME: Teaching and learning musculoskeletal anatomy through yoga and pilates.	Living AnatoME, a program designed in 2004 by two medical students in conjunction with the Director of Anatomy, teaches musculoskeletal anatomy through yoga and Pilates. Previously offered as an adjunct to the Gross Anatomy course in 2007, Living AnatoME became an official part of the curriculum. Previous research conducted on the program demonstrated its efficacy in providing relaxation and well-being to students who attended. In 2007, with all 144 gross anatomy students required to participate in a 1.5 hour Living AnatoME session on the upper and lower limbs, the impact of the program on students' comprehension of musculoskeletal anatomy was analyzed through the administration of 25-question pre- and post-tests, gauging knowledge in the following domains: upper limb, lower limb, muscle function, palpation, attachment/location, clinical correlate, and control (i.e., material not emphasized during the intervention). Analysis of postintervention tests revealed significant improvement in total Living AnatoME scores as well as in the domains of upper limb, muscle function, and palpation, indicating the possible efficacy of Living AnatoME in teaching anatomy. Performance on control questions also improved, although not significantly, which may indicate the role of other variables (e.g., additional study time) in increased performance.

22810599	Complementary and alternative medicine in multiple sclerosis.	Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is used by one-half to three-fourths of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Despite this widespread use, CAM may not be discussed in the course of a conventional medical visit. When considered in the context of MS, CAM therapies have a wide range of risk-benefit profiles. Some CAM therapies, such as acupuncture, cranberry, vitamin D, tai chi, and yoga, are low risk and possibly beneficial. Other CAM therapies, such as immune-stimulating supplements, bee venom, and hyperbaric oxygen, are ineffective, dangerous, or unstudied. Providing access to information about the risks and benefits of CAM therapies may increase the quality of care that is provided to patients with MS.	Bowling, Allen C	2010 Oct
20878904	Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and distress in a community-based sample.	BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have found Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) to be useful for a wide range of problems including anxiety, pain and coping with a medical illness. The primary goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an 8-week MBSR programme in relieving distress in a community based sample. METHODS: Subjects (n = 14) were participants in the MBSR programme at a major academic medical center and completed the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) prior to starting the class and at the end of the 8-week course. Means and standard deviations were computed for the pre-and post-POMS total and subscale measures and the MAAS. Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test was conducted. RESULTS: There were significant reductions on multiple dimensions of distress on the POMS as well as a significant increase in mindful awareness as measured by the MAAS. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that MBSR appears to be associated with a reduction of distress and increased awareness of everyday life experiences in a sample of residents living in a large urban community.

20877530	Yoga as a complementary therapy for children and adolescents: a guide for clinicians.	Yoga is being used by a growing number of youth and adults as a means of improving overall health and fitness. There is also a progressive trend toward use of yoga as a mind-body complementary and alternative medicine intervention to improve specific physical and mental health conditions. To provide clinicians with therapeutically useful information about yoga, the evidence evaluating yoga as an effective intervention for children and adolescents with health problems is reviewed and summarized. A brief overview of yoga and yoga therapy is presented along with yoga resources and practical strategies for clinical practitioners to use with their patients. The majority of available studies with children and adolescents suggest benefits to using yoga as a therapeutic intervention and show very few adverse effects. These results must be interpreted as preliminary findings because many of the studies have methodological limitations that prevent strong conclusions from being drawn. Yoga appears promising as a complementary therapy for children and adolescents. Further information about how to apply it most effectively and more coordinated research efforts are needed.

20866002	Long-term Vihangam Yoga meditation and scores on tests of attention.	Although the literature indicates that meditation has beneficial effects on several aspects of human functioning, few studies have specifically investigated the effects of meditation on various domains of attention. This study was conducted to examine the differences in various domains of attention between long-term concentrative meditators versus matched controls. 15 practitioners of Vihangam Yoga (> 10 yr. experience) were enrolled in the study. Controls matched on age, sex, and years of education were recruited. Both groups were administered the Stroop, Trail-Making, and Digit Symbol Substitution tests as well as the Digit Forward and Digit Backward tests. The group of Vihangam Yogis had significantly better mean performance on all tests of attention. Long-term Vihangam Yoga meditation improves attention span, processing speed, attention alternation ability, and performance in interference tests.

20863330	Dehydroepiandrosterone combined with exercise improves muscle strength and physical function in frail older women.	OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) combined with exercise on bone mass, strength, and physical function in older, frail women. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: A major medical institution. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-nine women (mean age 76.6 +/- 6.0) with low sulfated DHEA (DHEAS) levels, low bone mass, and frailty. INTERVENTION: Participants received 50 mg/d DHEA or placebo for 6 months; all received calcium and cholecalciferol. Women participated in 90-minute twice-weekly exercise regimens. MEASUREMENTS: Hormone levels, bone mineral density (BMD), bone turnover markers, body composition, upper and lower extremity strength, physical performance. RESULTS: Eighty-seven women (88%) completed 6 months. There were no significant changes in BMD or bone turnover markers. DHEA supplementation resulted in gains in lower extremity strength (from 459 +/- 121 N to 484 +/- 147 N; P=.01). There was also improvement in Short Physical Performance Battery score, a composite score that focuses on lower extremity function, in those taking DHEA (from 10.1 +/- 1.8 to 10.7 +/- 1.9; P=.02). There were significant changes in all hormone levels, including DHEAS, estradiol, estrone, and testosterone, and a decline in sex hormone-binding globulin levels in those taking DHEA. CONCLUSION: DHEA supplementation improved lower extremity strength and function in older, frail women involved in a gentle exercise program of chair aerobics or yoga. No changes were found in BMD either due to small sample size, short duration of study or no effect. The physical function findings are promising and require further evaluation as frail women are at high risk for falls and fracture.

20862694	Yoga and Pilates: associations with body image and disordered-eating behaviors in a population-based sample of young adults.	OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between participating in mind-body activities (yoga/Pilates) and body dissatisfaction and disordered eating (unhealthy and extreme weight control practices and binge eating) in a population-based sample of young adults. METHOD: The sample included 1,030 young men and 1,257 young women (mean age: 25.3 years, SD = 1.7) who participated in Project EAT-III (Eating and Activity in Teens and Young Adults). RESULTS: Among women, disordered eating was prevalent in yoga/Pilates participants and nonparticipants, with no differences between the groups. Men participating in yoga/Pilates were more likely to use extreme weight control behaviors (18.6% vs. 6.8%, p = .006) and binge eating (11.6% vs. 4.2%, p = .023), and marginally more likely to use unhealthy weight control behaviors (49.1% vs. 34.5%; p = .053), than nonparticipants after adjusting for sociodemographics, weight status, and overall physical activity. DISCUSSION: Findings suggest the importance of helping yoga/Pilates instructors recognize that their students may be at risk for disordered eating.

20859464	Perspectives on yoga inputs in the management of chronic pain.	Chronic pain is multi-dimensional. At the physical level itself, beyond the nociceptive pathway, there is hyper arousal state of the components of the nervous system, which negatively influences tension component of the muscles, patterns of breathing, energy levels and mindset, all of which exacerbate the distress and affect the quality of life of the individual and family. Beginning with the physical body, Yoga eventually influences all aspects of the person: vital, mental, emotional, intellectual and spiritual. It offers various levels and approaches to relax, energize, remodel and strengthen body and psyche. The asanas and pranayama harmonize the physiological system and initiate a "relaxation response" in the neuro endocrinal system. This consists of decreased metabolism, quieter breathing, stable blood pressure, reduced muscle tension, lower heart rate and slow brain wave pattern. As the neural discharge pattern gets modulated, hyper arousal of the nervous system and the static load on postural muscle come down. The function of viscera improves with the sense of relaxation and sleep gets deeper and sustained; fatigue diminishes. Several subtle level notional corrections can happen in case the subject meditates and that changes the context of the disease, pain and the meaning of life. Meditation and pranayama, along with relaxing asanas, can help individuals deal with the emotional aspects of chronic pain, reduce anxiety and depression effectively and improve the quality of life perceived.

20848578	Laughter yoga versus group exercise program in elderly depressed women: a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Laughter Yoga founded by M. Kataria is a combination of unconditioned laughter and yogic breathing. Its effect on mental and physical aspects of healthy individuals was shown to be beneficial. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of Kataria's Laughter Yoga and group exercise therapy in decreasing depression and increasing life satisfaction in older adult women of a cultural community of Tehran, Iran. METHODS: Seventy depressed old women who were members of a cultural community of Tehran were chosen by Geriatric depression scale (score>10). After completion of Life Satisfaction Scale pre-test and demographic questionnaire, subjects were randomized into three groups of laughter therapy, exercise therapy, and control. Subsequently, depression post-test and life satisfaction post-test were done for all three groups. The data were analyzed using analysis of covariance and Bonferroni's correction. RESULTS: Sixty subjects completed the study. The analysis revealed a significant difference in decrease in depression scores of both Laughter Yoga and exercise therapy group in comparison to control group (p<0.001 and p<0.01, respectively). There was no significant difference between Laughter Yoga and exercise therapy groups. The increase in life satisfaction of Laughter Yoga group showed a significant difference in comparison with control group (p<0.001). No significant difference was found between exercise therapy and either control or Laughter Yoga group. CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that Laughter Yoga is at least as effective as group exercise program in improvement of depression and life satisfaction of elderly depressed women.

20847193	"I could move mountains": adults with or at risk for type 2 diabetes reflect on their experiences with yoga practice.	PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe firsthand experiences with yoga as shared by adults with or at risk for type 2 diabetes and to examine their beliefs regarding maintenance of yoga practice over time. METHODS: In this qualitative study, 13 adults with or at risk for type 2 diabetes described their experiences with yoga and their beliefs regarding maintenance of yoga practice over time. Semistructured interviews occurred 16 to 20 months after completion of an 8-week yoga-based clinical trial. RESULTS: Themes of readiness for continuing yoga, environmental support for yoga, and integrating yoga emerged through data analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that yoga is appealing to some individuals with diabetes, but maintaining yoga practice over time is a challenge. Diabetes educators may be able to support maintenance by discussing specific strategies with individuals who express interest in yoga practice.

20846271	Effect of yoga therapy on facial emotion recognition deficits, symptoms and functioning in patients with schizophrenia.	OBJECTIVE: Facial emotion recognition deficits have been consistently demonstrated in schizophrenia and can impair socio-occupational functioning in these patients. Treatments to improve these deficits in antipsychotic-stabilized patients have not been well studied. Yoga therapy has been described to improve functioning in various domains in schizophrenia; however, its effect on FERD is not known. METHOD: Antipsychotic-stabilized patients randomized to receive Yoga (n=27), Exercise (n=17) or Waitlist group (n=22) were assessed at baseline, 2nd month, and 4th month of follow-up by raters blind to group status. Assessments included Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Socio-Occupational Functioning Scale (SOFS), and Tool for Recognition of Emotions in Neuropsychiatric DisorderS (TRENDS). RESULTS: There was a significant positive correlation between baseline FERD and socio-occupational functioning (r=0.3, P=0.01). Paired samples t test showed significant improvement in positive and negative symptoms, socio-occupational functioning and performance on TRENDS (P<0.05) in the Yoga group, but not in the other two groups. Maximum improvement occurred at the end of 2 months, and improvement in positive and negative symptoms persisted at the end of 4 months. CONCLUSION: Yoga therapy can be a useful add-on treatment to improve psychopathology, FERD, and socio-occupational functioning in antipsychotic-stabilized patients with schizophrenia.

The pathophysiologic role of enhanced chemosensitivity to carbon dioxide and/or hypoxia has been underscored in several cardiovascular diseases, including heart failure. In the early stages of this syndrome, the chemoreflex acts as a compensatory mechanism. Later on, however, it contributes to sustain the sympathetic activation, with detrimental effects on cardiovascular function and prognosis.

20842067	Effect of Iyengar yoga on mental health of incarcerated women: a feasibility study.	BACKGROUND: Incarcerated women share a disproportionate burden of mental illness. Although psychotropic medications are available to women in prison, adjunctive treatment modalities, such as Iyengar yoga, may increase psychological well-being. OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this study were (a) to address the feasibility of providing a gender-responsive exercise intervention within a correctional institution and (b) to observe the effect of a group-format Iyengar yoga program that met two sessions a week for 12 weeks on levels of depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and perceived stress among incarcerated women. METHODS: A repeated measures design, in which each participant served as her own control, was used. Participants completed three self-administered instruments: the Beck Depression Inventory, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the Perceived Stress Scale before treatment (baseline) and during treatment (Weeks 4, 8, and 12). Linear mixed effects models were used to examine statistically significant changes in mental health measures over time, taking advantage of all available data. RESULTS: Although 21 women initially participated in the intervention, 6 women completed the 12-week intervention. A significant linear decrease was demonstrated in symptoms of depression over time, with mean values changing from 24.90 at baseline to 5.67 at Week 12. There was a marginally significant decrease in anxiety over time (12.00 at baseline to 7.33 at Week 12) and a nonlinear change in stress over time, with decreases from baseline to Week 4 and subsequent increases to Week 12. DISCUSSION: Women who participated in this program experienced fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety over time. Findings from this study may be used to improve future interventions focusing on the health outcomes of incarcerated women.	Harner, Holly;Hanlon, Alexandra L;Garfinkel, Marian	2010 Nov-Dec
20824844	Cognitive behavioural therapy for tinnitus.	BACKGROUND: This is an update of a Cochrane Review originally published in Issue 1, 2007 of The Cochrane Library.Tinnitus is an auditory perception that can be described as the experience of sound, in the ear or in the head, in the absence of external acoustic stimulation. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) uses relaxation, cognitive restructuring of the thoughts and exposure to exacerbating situations in order to promote habituation and may benefit tinnitus patients, as may the treatment of associated psychological conditions. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether CBT is effective in the management of patients suffering from tinnitus. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; PsycINFO; ISRCTN and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 6 May 2010. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials in which patients with unilateral or bilateral tinnitus as their main symptom received cognitive behavioural treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One review author (PMD) assessed every report identified by the search strategy. Three authors (PMD, AW and MT) assessed the methodological quality and applied inclusion/exclusion criteria. Two authors (PMD and RP) extracted data and conducted the meta-analysis. The four authors contributed to the final text of the review. MAIN RESULTS: Eight trials comprising 468 participants were included.For the primary outcome of subjective tinnitus loudness we found no evidence of a difference between CBT and no treatment or another intervention (yoga, education and 'minimal contact - education').In the secondary outcomes we found evidence that quality of life scores were improved in participants who had tinnitus when comparing CBT to no treatment or another intervention (education and 'minimal contact education'). We also found evidence that depression scores improved when comparing CBT to no treatment. We found no evidence of benefit in depression scores when comparing CBT to other treatments (yoga, education and 'minimal contact - education').There were no adverse/side effects reported in any trial. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In six studies we found no evidence of a significant difference in the subjective loudness of tinnitus.However, we found a significant improvement in depression score (in six studies) and quality of life (decrease of global tinnitus severity) in another five studies, suggesting that CBT has a positive effect on the management of tinnitus.

20824231	Clinical Inquiries: Does exercise alleviate symptoms of depression?	Yes. Exercise reduces patient-perceived symptoms of depression when used as monotherapy (strength of recommendation [SOR]: B, meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [RCTs] with significant heterogeneity). It relieves symptoms as effectively as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or pharmacologic anti-depressant therapy (SOR: B, meta-analysis) and more effectively than bright light therapy (SOR: B, meta-analysis). Resistance exercise and mixed exercise (resistance and aerobic) work better than aerobic exercise alone (SOR: B, meta-analysis). High-frequency exercise is more effective than low-frequency exercise (SOR: B, small RCT). "Mindful" exercise, which has a meditative focus, such as tai chi and yoga, also reduces symptoms of depression (SOR: B, systematic review of RCTs).

20819977	Preference for geometric patterns early in life as a risk factor for autism.	CONTEXT: Early identification efforts are essential for the early treatment of the symptoms of autism but can only occur if robust risk factors are found. Children with autism often engage in repetitive behaviors and anecdotally prefer to visually examine geometric repetition, such as the moving blade of a fan or the spinning of a car wheel. The extent to which a preference for looking at geometric repetition is an early risk factor for autism has yet to be examined. OBJECTIVES: To determine if toddlers with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) aged 14 to 42 months prefer to visually examine dynamic geometric images more than social images and to determine if visual fixation patterns can correctly classify a toddler as having an ASD. DESIGN: Toddlers were presented with a 1-minute movie depicting moving geometric patterns on 1 side of a video monitor and children in high action, such as dancing or doing yoga, on the other. Using this preferential looking paradigm, total fixation duration and the number of saccades within each movie type were examined using eye tracking technology. SETTING: University of California, San Diego Autism Center of Excellence. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred ten toddlers participated in final analyses (37 with an ASD, 22 with developmental delay, and 51 typical developing toddlers). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Total fixation time within the geometric patterns or social images and the number of saccades were compared between diagnostic groups. RESULTS: Overall, toddlers with an ASD as young as 14 months spent significantly more time fixating on dynamic geometric images than other diagnostic groups. If a toddler spent more than 69% of his or her time fixating on geometric patterns, then the positive predictive value for accurately classifying that toddler as having an ASD was 100%. CONCLUSION: A preference for geometric patterns early in life may be a novel and easily detectable early signature of infants and toddlers at risk for autism.

20808194	Silver yoga exercises improved physical fitness of transitional frail elders.	BACKGROUND: Promoting the health of transitional frail elders (e.g., through therapeutic-based yoga exercises) is essential to reduce healthcare expenditures caused by chronic health problems. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of 24 weeks of the senior-tailored silver yoga (SY) exercise program for transitional frail elders. METHODS: A convenience sample of 69 elders in assisted living facilities were assigned randomly to the SY group (n = 38) or to the control group (n = 31) on the basis of the facilities where they resided, and 55 of them completed this quasi-experimental pretest and posttest study. Intervention was conducted three times per week, 70 minutes per session, for 24 weeks. Physical fitness (body composition, cardiovascular-respiratory functions, body flexibility, muscle power and endurance, balance, and agility) were examined at baseline, at 12 weeks, and at the end of the 24th week of the study. RESULTS: At the end of the study, the physical fitness indicators of participants in the SY group had improved significantly, and they had better physical fitness than participants in the control group (all p values < .05). DISCUSSION: It was recommended that the SY exercises be incorporated as an activity program in assisted living facilities to promote the physical fitness of transitional frail elders.

20797598	Yoga in heart failure patients: a pilot study.	BACKGROUND: Complementary therapies such as yoga practice have become commonplace, yet the safety, physical, and psychological effects on patients with heart failure (HF) are unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether an 8-week yoga program was safe and would positively influence physical and psychological function in HF patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Stable HF patients were recruited (n = 15) and completed (n = 12) 8 weeks of yoga classes. Data collected were: safety (cardiac and orthopedic adverse events); physical function (strength, balance, endurance, flexibility); and psychological function (quality of life [QOL], depression scores, mindfulness) before and after 8 weeks of yoga classes. RESULTS: Mean age was 52.4 + or - 11.6 with three-fourths (n = 9) being male and Caucasian. No participant had any adverse events. Endurance (P < .02) and strength (upper P = .04 and lower body P = .01) significantly improved. Balance improved by 13.6 seconds (26.9 + or - 19.7 to 40.0 + or - 18.5; P = .05). Symptom stability, a subscale of QOL, improved significantly (P = .02). Although no subject was depressed, overall mood was improved. Subjects subjectively reported improvements in overall well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga practice was safe, with participants experiencing improved physical function and symptom stability. Larger studies are warranted to provide more nonpharmacological options for improved outcomes in patients with HF.

20722471	Effects of yoga versus walking on mood, anxiety, and brain GABA levels: a randomized controlled MRS study.	OBJECTIVES: Yoga and exercise have beneficial effects on mood and anxiety. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic activity is reduced in mood and anxiety disorders. The practice of yoga postures is associated with increased brain GABA levels. This study addresses the question of whether changes in mood, anxiety, and GABA levels are specific to yoga or related to physical activity. METHODS: Healthy subjects with no significant medical/psychiatric disorders were randomized to yoga or a metabolically matched walking intervention for 60 minutes 3 times a week for 12 weeks. Mood and anxiety scales were taken at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, and before each magnetic resonance spectroscopy scan. Scan 1 was at baseline. Scan 2, obtained after the 12-week intervention, was followed by a 60-minute yoga or walking intervention, which was immediately followed by Scan 3. RESULTS: The yoga subjects (n = 19) reported greater improvement in mood and greater decreases in anxiety than the walking group (n = 15). There were positive correlations between improved mood and decreased anxiety and thalamic GABA levels. The yoga group had positive correlations between changes in mood scales and changes in GABA levels. CONCLUSIONS: The 12-week yoga intervention was associated with greater improvements in mood and anxiety than a metabolically matched walking exercise. This is the first study to demonstrate that increased thalamic GABA levels are associated with improved mood and decreased anxiety. It is also the first time that a behavioral intervention (i.e., yoga postures) has been associated with a positive correlation between acute increases in thalamic GABA levels and improvements in mood and anxiety scales. Given that pharmacologic agents that increase the activity of the GABA system are prescribed to improve mood and decrease anxiety, the reported correlations are in the expected direction. The possible role of GABA in mediating the beneficial effects of yoga on mood and anxiety warrants further study.

20721921	Use of complementary and alternative therapies in outpatients with Parkinson's disease in Argentina.	We interviewed 300 patients (54.7% male; mean age was 65.8 +/- 9.5) attending the Movement Disorders Clinic at the Buenos Aires University Hospital to determine the prevalence of CATs use and their association with demographic, social, or disease-specific characteristics among patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) in Buenos Aires, Argentina. We found that 25.7% of the PD patients interviewed (77/300) stated they had used CATs to improve their PD symptoms whereas 38.0% (114/300) had used some CATs without any relation to PD, at least once in life. At the moment of the interview, CATs prevalence use was 50.6% in the former group and 25.0% in the latter. The use of CATs was much more frequent among women and more common in the 50- to 69-year age group. Friends and neighbors of the patients had most frequently recommended these therapies. No major association was observed between CATs use and the duration of the disease, side of initial involvement, PD phenotype, or the Hoehn and Yahr staging. Acupuncture, homeopathy, yoga, and therapeutic massage were the most widely used therapies. After the initiation of conventional treatment the use of massage, yoga, and acupuncture in patients using CATs to improve PD significantly increased. Neurologists should be aware and inquire about the use of CATs to rule out potentially harmful effects.

20718623	State anxiety, psychological stress and positive well-being responses to yoga and aerobic exercise in people with schizophrenia: a pilot study.	PURPOSE: Worsening of schizophrenia symptoms is related to stress and anxiety. People with schizophrenia often experience difficulties in coping with stress and possess a limited repertoire of coping strategies. A randomised comparative trial was undertaken in patients with schizophrenia to evaluate changes in state anxiety, psychological stress and subjective well-being after single sessions of yoga and aerobic exercise compared with a control condition. METHOD: Forty participants performed a single 30-min yoga session, 20-min of aerobic exercise on a bicycle ergometre at self-selected intensity and a 20-min no exercise control condition in random order. RESULTS: After single sessions of yoga and aerobic exercise individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder showed significantly decreased state anxiety (p < 0.0001), decreased psychological stress (p < 0.0001) and increased subjective well-being (p < 0.0001) compared to a no exercise control condition. Effect sizes ranged from 0.82 for psychological stress after aerobic exercise to 1.01 for state anxiety after yoga. The magnitude of the changes did not differ significantly between yoga and aerobic exercise. CONCLUSION: People with schizophrenia and physiotherapists can choose either yoga or aerobic exercise in reducing acute stress and anxiety taking into account the personal preference of each individual.

20711844	Yoga and disc degenerative disease in cervical and lumbar spine: an MR imaging-based case control study.	The objective of the current study was to find out whether yoga practice was beneficial to the spine by comparing degenerative disc disease in the spines of long-time yoga practitioners and non-yoga practicing controls, using an objective measurement tool, magnetic resonance imaging. This matched case-control study comprised 18 yoga instructors with teaching experience of more than 10 years and 18 non-yoga practicing asymptomatic individuals randomly selected from a health checkup database. A validated grading scale was used to grade the condition of cervical and lumbar discs seen in magnetic resonance imaging of the spine, and the resulting data analyzed statistically. The mean number of years of yoga practice for the yoga group was 12.9 +/- 7.5. The overall (cervical + lumbar) disc scores of the yoga group were significantly lower (indicating less degenerative disc disease) than those of the control group (P < 0.001). The scores for the cervical vertebral discs of the yoga group were also significantly lower than those of the control group (P < 0.001), while the lower scores for the yoga group in the lumbar group approached, but did not reach, statistical significance (P = 0.055). The scores for individual discs of yoga practitioners showed significantly less degenerative disease at three disc levels, C3/C4, L2/L3 and L3/L4 (P < 0.05). Magnetic resonance imaging showed that the group of long-term practitioners of yoga studied had significantly less degenerative disc disease than a matched control group.

20646186	Yoga in male sexual functioning: a noncompararive pilot study.	INTRODUCTION: Yoga is practiced both in developing and developed countries. Many patients and yoga protagonists claim that it is useful in improving sexual functions and treating sexual disorders. AIM: We wanted to study the effect of yoga on male sexual functioning. METHODS: We studied 65 males (age range= 24-60 years, average age=40+/-8.26 years) who were enrolled in a yoga camp and administered a known questionnaire, i.e., Male Sexual Quotient (MSQ) before and after 12 weeks session of yoga. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: MSQ scores before and after yoga sessions. RESULTS: It was found that after the completion of yoga sessions, the sexual functions scores were significantly improved (P<0.0001). The improvement occurred in scores of all the domains of sexual functions as studied by MSQ (desire, intercourse satisfaction, performance, confidence, partner synchronization, erection, ejaculatory control, orgasm). CONCLUSIONS: Yoga appears to be an effective method of improving all domains of sexual functions in men as studied by MSQ.

20639346	Peaceful play yoga: serenity and balance for children with cancer and their parents.	Children with a cancer diagnosis experience symptom distress, including anxiety, because of the disease and its treatment. Parents experience stress and anxiety because of the uncertainty of the disease as well as the suffering of their children. Yoga is a complementary intervention that has physiological and psychological benefits in healthy children and healthy and chronically ill adults. On an inpatient hematology/oncology unit, 11 children aged 6 to 12 years, 5 adolescents aged 13 to 18 years, and 33 parents participated in a single yoga session tailored to the needs and abilities of the patients and parents. Sense of well-being pre- and postclass was measured with the Spielberger State Anxiety Scale. Children had normal anxiety scores preclass that did not change. Adolescents and parents experienced significant decreases in anxiety scores, and all cohorts gave positive feedback about the experience. The authors conclude that yoga is a feasible intervention for this population and is beneficial to adolescents and parents.

20632115	Effects of integrated yoga on quality of life and interpersonal relationship of pregnant women.	PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of integrated yoga on the quality of life and interpersonal relationships in normal pregnant women. METHODS: One hundred and two pregnant women between 18 and 20 weeks of gestation who met the inclusion criteria were recruited from the obstetric units in Bangalore and were randomly assigned to two groups of yoga (n = 51) and control (n = 51). Women with medical conditions that could potentially lead to pregnancy complications and those with abnormal fetal parameters were excluded. The yoga group received integrated yoga while control group received standard antenatal exercises, both for 1-h three times a week from 20th to 36th week of gestation. Pre and post assessments were done using WHOQOL-100 and FIRO-B questionnaires. RESULTS: Of the six domains of WHOQOL-100, between groups analysis showed significant improvements in the yoga group compared to the control in the physical (P = 0.001), psychological (P < 0.001), social (P = 0.003), and environmental domains (P = 0.001). In FIRO-B, the yoga group showed significant improvements in 'Expressed Inclusion' (P = 0.02) and 'Wanted Control' (P = 0.009) domains compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: The integrated yoga is an efficacious means of improving the quality of life of pregnant women and enhancing certain aspects of their interpersonal relationships.

20630360	The use of complementary and alternative medicines among a sample of Canadian menopausal-aged women.	INTRODUCTION: Despite questionable efficacy and safety, many women use a variety of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies to relieve menopause symptoms. METHODS: We examined the determinants and use of CAM therapies among a sample of menopausal-aged women in Canada by using a cross-sectional Web-based survey. RESULTS: Four hundred twenty-three women who were contacted through list serves, e-mail lists, and Internet advertisements provided complete data on demographics, use of CAM, therapies, and menopausal status and symptoms. Ninety-one percent of women reported trying CAM therapies for their symptoms. Women reported using an average of five kinds of CAM therapies. The most common treatments were vitamins (61.5%), relaxation techniques (57.0%), yoga/meditation (37.6%), soy products (37.4%), and prayer (35.7%). The most beneficial CAM therapies reported were prayer/spiritual healing, relaxation techniques, counseling/therapy, and therapeutic touch/Reiki. Demographic factors and menopausal symptoms contributed to 14% of the variance (P < .001) in the number of CAM therapies tried. DISCUSSION: Results support previous research showing that menopausal women have high user rates of CAM therapy and show that specific demographic factors and somatic symptomatology relate to use of CAM therapies. Health care providers can benefit from understanding the determinants and use of CAM by women during the menopause transition if they are to help and provide quality care for this population.

20624101	Teaching yoga to seniors: essential considerations to enhance safety and reduce risk in a uniquely vulnerable age group.	BACKGROUND: Seniors age 65 and older represent the fastest-growing sector of the population and, like many Americans, are increasingly drawn to yoga. This presents both an extraordinary opportunity and a serious challenge for yoga instructors who must be both a resource and guardians of safety for this uniquely vulnerable group. A typical class of seniors is likely to represent the most diverse mix of abilities of any age group. While some may be exceedingly healthy, most fit the profile of the average older adult in America, 80% of whom have at least one chronic health condition and 50% of whom have at least two. OBJECTIVES: This article discusses the Therapeutic Yoga for Seniors program, offered since 2007 at Duke Integrative Medicine to fill a critical need to help yoga instructors work safely and effectively with the increasing number of older adults coming to yoga classes, and explores three areas that pose the greatest risk of compromise to older adult students: sedentary lifestyle, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis. To provide a skillful framework for teaching yoga to seniors, we have developed specific Principles of Practice that integrate the knowledge gained from Western medicine with yogic teachings.

20605859	The evidence-base for complementary medicine in children: a critical overview of systematic reviews.	BACKGROUND: The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in paediatric populations is common yet, to date, there has been no synthesis of the evidence of its effectiveness in that population. This overview of systematic review evaluates the evidence for or against the effectiveness of CAM for any childhood condition. METHODS: Medline, AMED and Cochrane were searched from inception until September 2009. Reference lists of retrieved articles were hand-searched. Experts in the field of CAM were contacted. No language restrictions were applied. RESULTS: 17 systematic reviews were included in this overview, covering acupuncture, chiropractic, herbal medicine, homeopathy, hypnotherapy, massage and yoga. Results were unconvincing for most conditions although there is some evidence to suggest that acupuncture may be effective for postoperative nausea and vomiting, and that hypnotherapy may be effective in reducing procedure-related pain. Most of the reviews failed to mention the incidence of adverse effects of CAMs. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is some encouraging evidence for hypnosis, herbal medicine and acupuncture, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that other CAMs are effective for the treatment of childhood conditions. Many of the systematic reviews included in this overview were of low quality, as were the randomised clinical trials within those reviews, further reducing the weight of that evidence. Future research in CAM for children should conform to the reporting standards outlined in the CONSORT and PRISMA guidelines.	Hunt, Katherine;Ernst, Edzard	2011 Aug
22434968	Clinical effects of yoga on asthmatic patients: a preliminary clinical trial.	BACKGROUND: Asthma is one of the commonest respiratory diseases in Jimma area as well as a significant disease burden worldwide costing billions of dollars. Anti-asthmatic drugs that are available in the market are expensive and have adverse effects. Thus, it is wise to look for an adjunct therapy to alleviate these problems. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to see the effect of yoga on patterns of clinical features, peak expiratory flow rates and use of drugs in asthmatic patients. METHODS: A preliminary controlled clinical trial study was conducted on 24 volunteer asthmatic patients who were getting support at the missionary of charity. They were grouped in yoga and control groups. An Indian yoga expert through a translator conducted the training on yogic practice, yogic posture, breath slowing technique and discussion at the end. Then, the yoga groups were supervised for four weeks taking yoga exercise daily for 50 minutes. Peak expiratory flow rate was taken using the mini Wright peak flow meter and vital signs were measured in both groups. Data were analyzed using web based Graph pad quick calcs statistical software. RESULTS: The male to female ratio was 1:1 in both cases and control groups, 8(66.7%) were Christian and 9 (75.0%) were farmers. The yoga group showed 66.7% reduction in the use of salbutamole puff and 58.3% salbutamole tablets. There was a 10% increment in the PEFR in the yoga group while only 2% in the control group. There was statistically significant reduction in day and night asthma attacks in the yoga group. CONCLUSION: Yoga exercise among asthmatic patients resulted in a decreased number of day and night attacks and use of drugs. It also shows significant improvement in the peak expiratory flow rate. Further large scale study is recommended.	Mekonnen, Demeke;Mossie, Andualem	2010 Jul
20582748	[Content analysis of websites directed to low back pain].	OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the websites directed at providing information about low back pain with respect to their content and quality. METHODS: The websites were detected by scanning the words 'low back pain' from the Turkish pages module of the Google search portal. One hundred and fifty websites introduced on the first 20 pages were evaluated; the 65 websites determined to fulfill the desired criteria were analyzed in detail. RESULTS: Twenty of the 65 websites were excluded due to low quality, extraction from another website, sales promotion-related books/products, or qualified as news. In the majority of websites, no site administrator was indicated. When an administrator was indicated, the common specialities were physical therapists (13%), neurosurgeons (8%) and anesthesiologists (4%). Ten of the websites (22%) provided a pain definition close to international standards, whereas pain classification was available on most of the websites (84%). There was no mention of methods of pain scoring on any of them. Treatment modalities for which information was given included mostly behavioral, physical and pharmacological therapies, respectively. Complementary techniques, in order, included acupuncture, yoga and bioenergy. On 10 websites, text was supported with medical photographs, and videos were available on two. None of the websites had a provision for selection of other languages. CONCLUSION: Websites directed to low back pain should be enriched with respect to scientific content, thereby serving to increase the level of social education related to pain management.

20565550	An overview of 45 published database resources for complementary and alternative medicine.	BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has succeeded to implement itself in the academic context of universities. In order to get information on CAM, clinicians, researchers and healthcare professionals as well as the lay public are increasingly turning to online portals and databases, which disseminate relevant resources. One specific type of online information retrieval systems, namely the database, is being reviewed in this article. QUESTION: This overview aims at systematically retrieving and describing all databases covering the field of CAM. One of the requirements for inclusion was that the database would also have to be published in a medical journal. DATA SOURCES: The databases AMED, CAMbase, EMBASE, and MEDLINE/PubMed were searched between December 2008 and December 2009 for publications relevant to CAM databases. The authors' specialist library was also searched for grey literature to be included. STUDY SELECTION: All included databases were then visited online and information on the context, structure and volume of the database was extracted. MAIN RESULTS: Forty-five databases were included in this overview. Databases covered herbal therapies (n = 11), traditional Chinese medicine (n = 9) and some dealt with a vast number of CAM modalities (n = 9), amongst others. The amount of time the databases had been in existence ranged from 4 to 53 years. Countries of origin included the USA (n = 14), UK (n = 7) and Germany (n = 6), amongst others. The main language in 42 of 45 databases was English. CONCLUSIONS: Although this overview is quite comprehensive with respect to the field of CAM, certain CAM practices such as chiropractic, massage, reflexology, meditation or yoga may not have been covered adequately. A more detailed assessment of the quality of the included databases might give additional insights into the listed resources. The creation of a personalised meta-search engine is suggested, towards which this overview could be seen as a first step.

20556767	Meditation therapies for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).	BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common developmental disorders experienced in childhood and can persist into adulthood. The disorder has early onset and is characterized by a combination of overactive, poorly modulated behavior with marked inattention. In the long term it can impair academic performance, vocational success and social-emotional development. Meditation is increasingly used for psychological conditions and could be used as a tool for attentional training in the ADHD population. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of meditation therapies as a treatment for ADHD. SEARCH STRATEGY: Our extensive search included: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ERIC, PsycINFO, C2-SPECTR, dissertation abstracts, LILACS, Virtual Health Library (VHL) in BIREME, Complementary and Alternative Medicine specific databases, HSTAT, Informit, JST, Thai Psychiatric databases and ISI Proceedings, plus grey literature and trial registries from inception to January 2010. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials that investigated the efficacy of meditation therapy in children or adults diagnosed with ADHD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors extracted data independently using a pre-designed data extraction form. We contacted study authors for additional information required. We analyzed data using mean difference (MD) to calculate the treatment effect. The results are presented in tables, figures and narrative form. MAIN RESULTS: Four studies, including 83 participants, are included in this review. Two studies used mantra meditation while the other two used yoga compared with drugs, relaxation training, non-specific exercises and standard treatment control. Design limitations caused high risk of bias across the studies. Only one out of four studies provided data appropriate for analysis. For this study there was no statistically significant difference between the meditation therapy group and the drug therapy group on the teacher rating ADHD scale (MD -2.72, 95% CI -8.49 to 3.05, 15 patients). Likewise, there was no statistically significant difference between the meditation therapy group and the standard therapy group on the teacher rating ADHD scale (MD -0.52, 95% CI -5.88 to 4.84, 17 patients). There was also no statistically significant difference between the meditation therapy group and the standard therapy group in the distraction test (MD -8.34, 95% CI -107.05 to 90.37, 17 patients). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: As a result of the limited number of included studies, the small sample sizes and the high risk of bias, we are unable to draw any conclusions regarding the effectiveness of meditation therapy for ADHD. The adverse effects of meditation have not been reported. More trials are needed.	Krisanaprakornkit, Thawatchai;Ngamjarus, Chetta;Witoonchart, Chartree;Piyavhatkul, Nawanant	2010 Jun 16
20555256	Experiences of a mindfulness-based stress-reduction intervention among patients with cancer.	BACKGROUND: There is increasing recognition of mindfulness and mindfulness training as a way to decrease stress and increase psychological functioning. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the perceived effects and experiences of mindfulness stress-reduction training as described by patients with cancer participating in a mindfulness-based stress-reduction training program. INTERVENTIONS/METHODS: The study is based on analysis of data collected in semistructured interviews of the participants (n = 18) after the completion of a mindfulness-meditation training program. The intervention consisted of an 8-week mindfulness-training course. RESULTS: Most participants expressed a number of perceived positive effects of participating in the mindfulness program including increased calm, enhanced sleep quality, more energy, less physical pain, and increased well-being. However, a few participants experienced no effect. Both negative and positive views of the specific meditation and yoga exercises included in the program were expressed. Components that were described as of particular importance, regarding the experience of participating in the program, were the nonjudgmental and accepting approach guiding the program and the instructors, the influence of the group process and sharing experiences with patients with similar experiences, and the emphasis on increased awareness of the present moment. CONCLUSION: This study gives support for the use of mindfulness programs in reducing stress-related complaints among some patients with a cancer diagnosis. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The positive experiences of mindfulness training reported by patients with cancer call for further studies examining the possibilities and requirements for implementation of mindfulness programs in clinical practice.

20551497	The physiological cost and enjoyment of Wii Fit in adolescents, young adults, and older adults.	BACKGROUND: Active video games (exergames) increase energy expenditure (EE) and physical activity (PA) compared with sedentary video gaming. The physiological cost and enjoyment of exergaming in adolescents, and young and older adults has not been documented, nor compared with aerobic exercise. This study compared the physiological cost and enjoyment of exergaming on Wii Fit with aerobic exercise in 3 populations. METHODS: Cardiorespiratory and enjoyment measurements were compared in 14 adolescents, 15 young adults, and 13 older adults during handheld inactive video gaming, Wii Fit activities (yoga, muscle conditioning, balance, aerobics), and brisk treadmill walking and jogging. RESULTS: For all groups EE and heart rate (HR) of Wii Fit activities were greater than handheld gaming (P < .001) but lower than treadmill exercise (P <or= .001). Wii aerobics elicited moderate intensity activity in adolescents, young adults, and older adults with respective mean (SD) metabolic equivalents of 3.2 (0.7), 3.6 (0.8), and 3.2 (0.8). HR during Wii aerobics fell below the recommended intensity for maintaining cardiorespiratory fitness. Group enjoyment rating was greater for Wii balance and aerobics compared with treadmill walking and jogging (P <or= .05). CONCLUSIONS: Wii Fit appears an enjoyable exergame for adolescents and adults, stimulating light-to-moderate intensity activity through the modification of typically sedentary leisure behavior.

20516534	Effect of pranayama & yoga-asana on cognitive brain functions in type 2 diabetes-P3 event related evoked potential (ERP).	BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Electrophysiological evidence of delayed cognition as measured by P300, an evoked potential is observed in Diabetes mellitus. P300 (or P3) is a component of endogenous cerebral evoked response that assesses higher functions of the brain. Our study aims to see the role of pranayama and yoga-asana on P300 latency and amplitude in type 2 diabetic patients. METHODS: Sixty patients of type 2 diabetes were recruited from diabetic clinic and divided into two groups - control group on only conventional medical therapy and yoga-group on conventional medical therapy along with pranayama and yoga-asana. Basal recordings of P300 and blood glucose were taken at the time of recruitment and second recordings repeated after forty five days for both the groups. P300 was recorded on Nihon Kohden Neuropack mu MEB 9100 using auditory "odd-ball paradigm". The data were analysed using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's test at 5 per cent level of significance. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvement in the latency and the amplitude of N200, P300 was observed in the yoga group as compared to the control group. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that yoga has a beneficial effect on P300 and thus can be incorporated along with the conventional medical therapy for improving cognitive brain functions in diabetes.

20509333	Non-pharmacological management of nasal polyp: a case report.	Nasal polyp causes difficulty in breathing due to blockage of nasal passage. The pathogenesis of nasal polyposis is not known. The primary medical therapy available for nasal polyposis is steroid administration. Antihistamines, decongestants and cromolyn sodium provide little benefit. With this background of nasal polyp pathophysiology and the existing management, a case of nasal polyp was treated with the cleansing process of yoga i.e. neti kriya and naturopathy with good result. This isolated case report warrants a need for controlled clinical trial of neti kriya to establish its role in the management of nasal polyposis.	Rastogi, Rajiv;Murthy, B T C;Vinudha	2009 Oct-Dec

20493343	Integrative medicine approach to chronic pain.	Chronic pain can be a frustrating condition for patient and clinician. The integrative medicine approach to pain can offer hope, adding safe complementary and alternative medical (CAM) therapies to mitigate pain and suffering. Such CAM therapies include nutrition, supplements and herbs, manual medicine, acupuncture, yoga, and mind-body approaches. The evidence is heterogeneous regarding these approaches, but some evidence suggests efficacy and confirms safety. The integrative medicine approach can be beneficial in a patient with chronic pain.

20491514	Complementary and alternative medicine use by osteoporotic patients in Australia (CAMEO-A): a prospective study.	OBJECTIVE: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies have become increasingly popular and are used regularly by patients with osteoporosis in Australasia and worldwide. This study was done to determine the prevalence and patterns of use of CAM in an Australian osteoporosis clinic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a prospective, cross-sectional questionnaire-based study of 202 patients attending an academic osteoporosis clinic in Sydney, Australia. RESULTS: Subject had a mean age of 68.5 +/- 10.9 years, 79.7% were female, and 55.9% were born overseas. CAM use was reported by 104 patients (51.5%) using the standard and 62 patients (30.7%) using the stringent definition of CAM. The most frequent CAM were multivitamins (24.0%), acupuncture (19.2%), t'ai chi (14.4%), and yoga (12.5%). Seventy-three percent (73%) did not consult a physician before starting CAM and 23.1% stated that their treating specialists were unaware of CAM use. The most common reasons for using CAM were having a holistic approach (53.0%) and inadequate pain control (29.0%). CAM users were associated with Asian country of birth (23.1% versus 12.2%, p = 0.03), more frequent clinic visits over a 12-month period (1.8 versus 1.5 times, p = 0.03), and a trend for a worse lumbar spine T-score (-2.35 versus -2.20 SD, p = 0.05) and higher rates of university education (26.0% versus 14.3%, p = 0.05). It is estimated that $696 million is spent annually on CAM by patients with osteoporosis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients attending osteoporosis clinics frequently use CAM. Physicians may need to routinely inquire about a history of CAM use to ensure better screening for possible adverse clinical interactions.	Mak, Jenson C S;Faux, Steven	2010 May
20490348	Current options for nonsurgical management of carpal tunnel syndrome.	Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common of the entrapment neuropathies. Surgical decompression is commonly performed and has traditionally been considered the defnitive treatment for CTS. Conservative treatment options include physical therapy, bracing, steroid injections and alternative medicine. While CTS is often progressive, patients may get better without formal treatment. The resolution of symptoms is not necessarily related to the severity of the clinical findings and self-limited activity is common. The current literature suggests that bracing and corticosteroid injections may be useful in the nonsurgical treatment of CTS, although the benefits may be short term. There is limited evidence regarding the efficacy of other treatments, such as therapy, exercise, yoga, acupuncture, lasers and magnets, and further studies are needed. Surgery is recommended for progressive functional deficits and significant pain.	Carlson, Hans;Colbert, Agatha;Frydl, Jennifer;Arnall, Elizabeth;Elliot, Molly;Carlson, Nels	2010 Feb

20484057	Effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on cardiovascular risk factors in older women with frailty characteristics.	OBJECTIVE: this analysis was to investigate the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on cardiovascular risk factors in older women with frailty characteristics. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the study was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of 99 women (mean 76.6 +/- 6.0 year) with the low DHEA-S level and frailty. INTERVENTION: participants received 50 mg/day DHEA or placebo for 6 months; all received calcium (1,000-1,200 mg/day diet) and supplement (combined) and cholecalciferol (1,000 IU/day). Women participated in 90-min twice weekly exercise regimens, either chair aerobics or yoga. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: assessment of outcome variables included hormone levels (DHEA-S, oestradiol, oestrone, testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)), lipid profiles (total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides), body composition measured by dual energy absorptiometry, glucose levels and blood pressure (BP). RESULTS: eighty-seven women (88%) completed 6 months of study; 88% were pre-frail demonstrating 1-2 frailty characteristics and 12% were frail with > or =3 characteristics. There were significant changes in all hormone levels including DHEA-S, oestradiol, oestrone and testosterone and a decline in SHBG levels in those taking DHEA supplements. In spite of changes in hormone levels, there were no significant changes in cardiovascular risk factors including lipid profiles, body or abdominal fat, fasting glucose or BP. CONCLUSION: research to date has not shown consistent effects of DHEA on cardiovascular risk, and this study adds to the literature that short-term therapy with DHEA is safe for older women in relation to cardiovascular risk factors. This study is novel in that we recruited women with evidence of physical frailty.	Boxer, R S;Kleppinger, A;Brindisi, J;Feinn, R;Burleson, J A;Kenny, A M	2010 Jul

20473691	A qualitative study of mindfulness-based meditation therapy in Japanese cancer patients.	PURPOSE: The primary objective of the study was to examine mindfulness-based meditation therapy qualitatively. A secondary goal was to examine the differences in themes selected by Japanese and Western patients receiving this therapy. METHODS: The subjects were 28 patients who were undergoing anti-cancer treatment. The subjects participated in two sessions of mindfulness-based meditation therapy, including breathing, yoga movement, and meditation. Each patient was taught the program in the first session, then exercised at home with a CD, and subsequently met the interviewer in a second session after 2 weeks. Primary physicians recruited the patients and interviews were conducted individually by nurses or psychologists with training in the program. Patients provided answers to pre- and post-intervention interviews about the meaning of their illness. RESULTS: Narrative data from the semi-structured interview were analyzed qualitatively. Pre-intervention, themes such as "Effort to cope," "Looking back," "Spirituality," "Personal growth," and "Suffering" were often chosen. Post-intervention, themes such as "Adapted coping," "Personal growth," "Positive meaning," "Spirituality," and "Negative recognition" were more commonly chosen. CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness-based meditation therapy may be effective for producing adapted coping, including positive recognition and changes for an adapted lifestyle. There were some common aspects and some differences in the themes selected by patients in this study and Western patients received mindfulness therapy in other studies.

20471550	Iyengar yoga for young adults with rheumatoid arthritis: results from a mixed-methods pilot study.	CONTEXT: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disease that often impacts patient's quality of life. For young people with RA, there is a need for rehabilitative approaches that have been shown to be safe and to lead to improved functioning. OBJECTIVES: This pilot study investigated the feasibility of a single-arm, group-administered, six-week, biweekly Iyengar yoga (IY) program for eight young adults with RA. METHODS: IY is known for its use of props, therapeutic sequences designed for patient populations, emphasis on alignment, and a rigorous teacher training. Treatment outcomes were evaluated using a mixed-methods approach that combined quantitative results from standardized questionnaires and qualitative interviews with participants. RESULTS: Initial attrition was 37% (n=3) after the first week because of scheduling conflicts and a prior non-RA related injury. However, the remaining participants (n=5) completed between 75% and 100% of treatment sessions (mean=95%). No adverse events were reported. The quantitative results indicated significant improvements in pain, pain disability, depression, mental health, vitality, and self-efficacy. Interviews demonstrated improvement in RA symptoms and functioning but uncertainty about whether the intervention affected pain. CONCLUSION: These preliminary findings indicate that IY is a feasible complementary approach for young people with RA, although larger clinical trials are needed to demonstrate safety and efficacy.

20467310	Pilot evaluation of an Iyengar yoga program for breast cancer survivors.	BACKGROUND: With continual improvements in screening uptake and adjuvant cancer treatments, the number of Canadian women surviving breast cancer continues to grow. Preliminary findings suggest yoga can improve quality of life (QoL) in breast cancer survivors, but few studies have focused on Iyengar yoga (IY). OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the impact of IY on QoL and psychosocial functioning in a select sample of breast cancer survivors. METHODS: Breast cancer survivors (N = 24) participating in IY classes completed a questionnaire measuring generic and disease-specific QoL and psychosocial functioning, before and after the 12-week classes. RESULTS: Postprogram questionnaires were completed by 17 participants (71%) who attended an average of 78.9% of the IY sessions. Several indicators of generic QoL improved significantly, including mental health (mean change, +4.2; P = .045), vitality (mean change, +4.9; P = .033), role-emotional (mean change, +6.4; P = .010), and bodily pain (mean change, +4.4; P = .024). Other improvements in QoL and psychosocial functioning were meaningful but were not statistically significant. Findings were further substantiated by participant's evaluation of the program's benefits and motivational value. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study of breast cancer survivors participating in IY, we found improvements in QoL and psychosocial functioning. Moreover, positive program evaluation and motivational profile provide support for the acceptability of IY with breast cancer survivors. Randomized controlled trials comparing IY to usual care and other forms of yoga in breast cancer survivors are warranted. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Nurses may consider IY as a possible intervention strategy to help breast cancer survivors improve their QoL and psychosocial functioning.

20464730	Exercise therapy for schizophrenia.	BACKGROUND: The health benefits of physical activity and exercise are well documented and these effects could help people with schizophrenia. OBJECTIVES: To determine the mental health effects of exercise/physical activity programmes for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (December 2008) which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. We also inspected references within relevant papers. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included all randomised controlled trials comparing any intervention where physical activity or exercise was considered to be the main or active ingredient with standard care or other treatments for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We independently inspected citations and abstracts, ordered papers, quality assessed and data extracted. For binary outcomes we calculated a fixed-effect risk ratio (RR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI). Where possible, the weighted number needed to treat/harm statistic (NNT/H) and its 95% confidence interval (CI), was also calculated. For continuous outcomes, endpoint data were preferred to change data. We synthesised non-skewed data from valid scales using a weighted mean difference (WMD). MAIN RESULTS: Three randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Trials assessed the effects of exercise on physical and mental health. Overall numbers leaving the trials were similar. Two trials (Beebe 2005 and Marzaloni 2008) compared exercise to standard care and both found exercise to significantly improve negative symptoms of mental state (Mental Health Inventory Depression: 1RCT, n=10, MD 17.50 CI 6.70 to 28.30, PANNS negative: 1RCT, n=10, MD -8.50 CI -11.11 to -5.89). No absolute effects were found for positive symptoms of mental state. Physical health improved significantly in the exercise group compared to those in standard care (1RCT, n=13, MD 79.50 CI 33.82 to 125.18), but no effect on peoples' weight/BMI was apparent. Duraiswamy 2007 compared exercise with yoga and found that yoga had a better outcome for mental state (PANNS total: 1RCT, n=41, MD 14.95 CI 2.60 to 27.30). The same trial also found those in the yoga group had significantly better quality of life scores (WHOQOL Physical: 1RCT, n=41, MD -9.22 CI -18.86 to 0.42). Adverse effects (AIMS total scores) were, however, similar. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Results of this Cochrane review are similar to existing reviews that have examined the health benefits of exercise in this population (Faulkner 2005). Although studies included in this review are small and used various measures of physical and mental health, results indicated that regular exercise programmes are possible in this population, and that they can have healthful effects on both the physical and mental health and well-being of individuals with schizophrenia. Larger randomised studies are required before any definitive conclusions can be drawn.	Gorczynski, Paul;Faulkner, Guy	2010 May 12
20458540	Factors that influence self-reported general health status among different Asian ethnic groups: evidence from the Roadmap to the New Horizon: Linking Asians to Improved Health and Wellness study.	Little is known about the determinants of self-reported general health status among different Asian ethnic subgroups. Using a community-based participatory research approach, we designed, administered, and analyzed a cross-sectional survey of 705 Asians (292 Chinese, 226 Korean, 187 Vietnamese) in the Portland, Oregon region to describe associations between general health status and several sociodemographic and health-related factors in pooled and ethnic-group-stratified samples. Ethnic variation existed in all covariate distributions, except employment, public-service use, language use, health status, visiting healthcare providers, sleep habits, and use of prayer, meditation, yoga or acupuncture. Acculturation measures were strong predictors of poor/fair health in logistic regression models regardless of ethnicity. Ethnic variation in outcome status existed for all remaining covariates. Most health-related research overlooks the heterogeneity within the Asian population. These findings highlight substantial variability in the associations between self-reported general health status and sociodemographic and health-related measures between Asian ethnic groups.

20456683	Embodied masculinities in the context of cardiac rehabilitation.	Interest continues to gather in relation to the sociology of the body, gendered embodiment and the theoretical links between these in both health and ill-health contexts. However, the available empirical work that links embodiment, masculinities and health remains sparse. This paper presents secondary data analysis from an original study that aimed to consider the similarities and differences in the experience of a continuing (phase four) cardiac rehabilitation programme for individuals choosing to participate in either an exercise or yoga component. The data presented are derived from two in-depth interviews, carried out a year apart, with each of the 34 men who completed the original study. Watson's (2000)'male body schema' was used to guide initial data coding and the subsequent analysis generated four overarching themes: 'embodied emotionality'; 'renegotiated embodiment'; 'embodiment and fitness' and 'knowing the hidden body'. An approach that theorises from, rather than about, men's bodies is fostered, and questions are raised about previous work that suggests men are emotionally 'disconnected' from their bodies and/or that they have a wholly mechanistic view of bodily function.

20454759	Moving beyond health to flourishing: the effects of yoga teacher training.	Research in the medical and psychological fields has primarily followed a "disease-focused" approach to health. Although there is growing research on the components and outcomes of well-being, very few studies have focused on traditional practices that can be used as interventions to encourage human flourishing. The current study was developed to address this research gap. We suggest one effective method of increasing psychological well-being, the practice of yoga, an age-old practice that has been said to produce physical and psychological health. In this observational study, we examined associations with participation in a 4-week yoga teacher training resident program. Measurement instruments were chosen to capture changes in psychosocial health and human flourishing. Measurements were taken before the start of the program, immediately after the program, and 3 months postprogram. As expected, in this healthy population, the human flourishing scales showed more change than the psychosocial health scales. For example, in this healthy sample, there were no significant changes in perceived social support, quality of life, or self-efficacy from baseline to the 3-month follow-up. However, optimism, a positive psychology research measure, improved from baseline to follow-up. The mindfulness subscales of observation, awareness, and nonreactivity all improved following the training, suggesting that one benefit of yoga practice is a more refined ability to attend to one's inner experience. This study adds to the growing literature focusing on interventions that move beyond relieving pathology to those that produce optimal functioning and human thriving.

20453181	Perceived benefit of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) for back pain: a national survey.	BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is commonly used to treat back pain, but little is known about factors associated with improvement. METHODS: We used data from the 2002 National Health Interview Survey to examine the associations between the perceived helpfulness of various CAM therapies for back pain. RESULTS: Approximately 6% of the US population used CAM to treat their back pain in 2002. Sixty percent of respondents who used CAM for back pain perceived a "great deal" of benefit. Using multivariable logistic regression, the factor associated with perceived benefit from CAM modalities was reporting that a reason for using CAM was that "conventional medical treatment would not help" (odds ratio [OR], 1.46; 95% CI, 1.14-1.86). The 2 factors associated with less perceived benefit from CAM modalities were fair to poor self-reported health status (OR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.41-0.82) and referral by a conventional medical practitioner for CAM (OR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.54-0.92). Using chiropractic as a reference, massage (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.46-0.83), relaxation techniques (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.14-0.45), and herbal therapy (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.19-0.46) were all associated with less perceived benefit whereas those with similar perceived benefit included yoga/tai chi/qi gong (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.41-1.22) and acupuncture (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.37-1.38). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of respondents who used CAM for back pain perceived benefit. Specific factors and therapies associated with perceived benefit warrant further investigation.

20441854	Severe-to-fatal head injuries in motor vehicle impacts.	Severe-to-fatal head injuries in motor vehicle environments were analyzed using the United States Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network database for the years 1997-2006. Medical evaluations included details and photographs of injury, and on-scene, trauma bay, emergency room, intensive care unit, radiological, operating room, in-patient, and rehabilitation records. Data were synthesized on a case-by-case basis. X-rays, computed tomography scans, and magnetic resonance images were reviewed along with field evaluations of scene and photographs for the analyses of brain injuries and skull fractures. Injuries to the parenchyma, arteries, brainstem, cerebellum, cerebrum, and loss of consciousness were included. In addition to the analyses of severe-to-fatal (AIS4+) injuries, cervical spine, face, and scalp trauma were used to determine the potential for head contact. Fatalities and survivors were compared using nonparametric tests and confidence intervals for medians. Results were categorized based on the mode of impact with a focus on head contact. Out of the 3178 medical cases and 169 occupants sustaining head injuries, 132 adults were in frontal (54), side (75), and rear (3) crashes. Head contact locations are presented for each mode. A majority of cases clustered around the mid-size anthropometry and normal body mass index (BMI). Injuries occurred at change in velocities (DeltaV) representative of US regulations. Statistically significant differences in DeltaV between fatalities and survivors were found for side but not for frontal impacts. Independent of the impact mode and survivorship, contact locations were found to be superior to the center of gravity of the head, suggesting a greater role for angular than translational head kinematics. However, contact locations were biased to the impact mode: anterior aspects of the frontal bone and face were involved in frontal impacts while temporal-parietal regions were involved in side impacts. Because head injuries occur at regulatory DeltaV in modern vehicles and angular accelerations are not directly incorporated in crashworthiness standards, these findings from the largest dataset in literature, offer a field-based rationale for including rotational kinematics in injury assessments. In addition, it may be necessary to develop injury criteria and evaluate dummy biofidelity based on contact locations as this parameter depended on the impact mode. The current field-based analysis has identified the importance of both angular acceleration and contact location in head injury assessment and mitigation.

20440550	Feasibility and preliminary outcomes of a school-based mindfulness intervention for urban youth.	Youth in underserved, urban communities are at risk for a range of negative outcomes related to stress, including social-emotional difficulties, behavior problems, and poor academic performance. Mindfulness-based approaches may improve adjustment among chronically stressed and disadvantaged youth by enhancing self-regulatory capacities. This paper reports findings from a pilot randomized controlled trial assessing the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes of a school-based mindfulness and yoga intervention. Four urban public schools were randomized to an intervention or wait-list control condition (n=97 fourth and fifth graders, 60.8% female). It was hypothesized that the 12-week intervention would reduce involuntary stress responses and improve mental health outcomes and social adjustment. Stress responses, depressive symptoms, and peer relations were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Findings suggest the intervention was attractive to students, teachers, and school administrators and that it had a positive impact on problematic responses to stress including rumination, intrusive thoughts, and emotional arousal.

20429895	Yoga as a complementary treatment for smoking cessation: rationale, study design and participant characteristics of the Quitting-in-Balance study.	BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking remains the leading preventable cause of death among American women. Exercise has shown promise as an aid to smoking cessation because it reduces weight gain and weight concerns, improves affect, and reduces nicotine withdrawal symptoms and cigarette craving. Studies have shown that the practice of yoga improves weight control, and reduces perceived stress and negative affect. Yoga practice also includes regulation of breathing and focused attention, both of which may enhance stress reduction and improve mood and well-being and may improve cessation outcomes. METHODS/DESIGN: This pilot efficacy study is designed to examine the rates of cessation among women randomized to either a novel, 8-week Yoga plus Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) smoking cessation intervention versus a Wellness program plus the same CBT smoking cessation intervention. Outcome measures include 7-day point prevalence abstinence at end of treatment, 3 and 6 months follow up and potential mediating variables (e.g., confidence in quitting smoking, self-efficacy). Other assessments include measures of mindfulness, spirituality, depressive symptoms, anxiety and perceived health (SF-36). DISCUSSION: Innovative treatments are needed that address barriers to successful smoking cessation among men and women. The design chosen for this study will allow us to explore potential mediators of intervention efficacy so that we may better understand the mechanism(s) by which yoga may act as an effective complementary treatment for smoking cessation. If shown to be effective, yoga can offer an alternative to traditional exercise for reducing negative symptoms that often accompany smoking cessation and predict relapse to smoking among recent quitters.

20409260	Exercise prescription and the patient with type 2 diabetes: a clinical approach to optimizing patient outcomes.	PURPOSE: To review the current recommendations for physical activity in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and propose methods to optimize compliance, reduce the pharmaceutical burden, and improve the general health and well-being of patients with T2DM. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, SportDiscus, Ovid MEDLINE, Psychinfo, Web of Science, LexisNexis, and EBM reviews. CONCLUSIONS: T2DM is a condition in which physical activity has been documented to improve patient outcomes, yet research has noted that healthcare professionals inadequately address this issue, resulting in physical activity being an underutilized therapy. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: An exercise prescription consists of mode (type), frequency, intensity, duration, and progression. Determining the appropriate mode depends upon patient preference and safety issues regarding the state of T2DM or other conditions. Frequency, intensity, and duration are specific to the type of activity and should be tailored to the patient's abilities to safely perform the activity. Finally, the health professional addresses periodic progression in order to maintain the exercise stimulus needed to promote continued health improvements and prevent "plateauing." In this article, on the basis of the current scientific research, we propose recommendations that enable healthcare professionals to advocate for their patients with T2DM by offering safe and effective treatment options.

20401789	The ABC of Physical Activity for Health: a consensus statement from the British Association of Sport and Exercise Sciences.	Our understanding of the relationship between physical activity and health is constantly evolving. Therefore, the British Association of Sport and Exercise Sciences convened a panel of experts to review the literature and produce guidelines that health professionals might use. In the ABC of Physical Activity for Health, A is for All healthy adults, B is for Beginners, and C is for Conditioned individuals. All healthy adults aged 18-65 years should aim to take part in at least 150 min of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week, or at least 75 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, or equivalent combinations of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activities. Moderate-intensity activities are those in which heart rate and breathing are raised, but it is possible to speak comfortably. Vigorous-intensity activities are those in which heart rate is higher, breathing is heavier, and conversation is harder. Aerobic activities should be undertaken in bouts of at least 10 min and, ideally, should be performed on five or more days a week. All healthy adults should also perform muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days a week. Weight training, circuit classes, yoga, and other muscle-strengthening activities offer additional health benefits and may help older adults to maintain physical independence. Beginners should work steadily towards meeting the physical activity levels recommended for all healthy adults. Even small increases in activity will bring some health benefits in the early stages and it is important to set achievable goals that provide success, build confidence, and increase motivation. For example, a beginner might be asked to walk an extra 10 min every other day for several weeks to slowly reach the recommended levels of activity for all healthy adults. It is also critical that beginners find activities they enjoy and gain support in becoming more active from family and friends. Conditioned individuals who have met the physical activity levels recommended for all healthy adults for at least 6 months may obtain additional health benefits by engaging in 300 min or more of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, or 150 min or more of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity each week, or equivalent combinations of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activities. Adults who find it difficult to maintain a normal weight and adults with increased risk of cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes may in particular benefit from going beyond the levels of activity recommended for all healthy adults and gradually progressing towards meeting the recommendations for conditioned individuals. Physical activity is beneficial to health with or without weight loss, but adults who find it difficult to maintain a normal weight should probably be encouraged to reduce energy intake and minimize time spent in sedentary behaviours to prevent further weight gain. Children and young people aged 5-16 years should accumulate at least 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per day, including vigorous-intensity aerobic activities that improve bone density and muscle strength.

20400694	Open trial of Vinyasa yoga for persistently depressed individuals: evidence of feasibility and acceptability.	The aim of this study was to assess the acceptability and feasibility of Vinyasa yoga as an adjunctive treatment for depressed patients who were not responding adequately to antidepressant medication. The authors also planned to ask participants for qualitative feedback on their experience of the class and to assess change over time in depression and in possible mediating variables. The authors recruited 11 participants in 1 month for an 8-week open trial of yoga classes. They found that 10 participants completed follow-up assessments, 9 of 10 were positive about their experience, and all provided feedback about what was and was not helpful about yoga, as well as barriers to class attendance. Over the 2-month period, participants exhibited significant decreases in depression symptoms and significant increases in an aspect of mindfulness and in behavior activation. This pilot study provided support for continuing to investigate Vinyasa yoga as an adjunct treatment for depression. The next step required is a rigorous randomized clinical trial.

20388445	Yoga improves quality of life and benefit finding in women undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer.	This study examined the effects of yoga on quality of life (QOL) and psychosocial outcomes in women with breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy. Sixty-one women were randomly assigned to either a yoga or a wait-list group. Yoga classes were taught biweekly during the 6 weeks of radiotherapy. Participants completed measures of QOL, fatigue, benefit finding (finding meaning in the cancer experience), intrusive thoughts, sleep disturbances, depressive symptoms, and anxiety before radiotherapy and then again 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after the end of radiotherapy. General linear model analyses revealed that compared to the control group, the yoga group reported significantly better general health perception (p = .005) and physical functioning scores (p = .04) 1 week postradiotherapy; higher levels of intrusive thoughts 1 month postradiotherapy (p = .01); and greater benefit finding 3 months postradiotherapy (p = .01). There were no other group differences in other QOL subscales for fatigue, depression, or sleep scores. Exploratory analyses indicated that intrusive thoughts 1 month after radiotherapy were significantly positively correlated with benefit finding 3 months after radiotherapy (r = .36, p = .011). Our results indicated that the yoga program was associated with statistically and clinically significant improvements in aspects of QOL.

20387774	Exercise, yoga, and meditation for depressive and anxiety disorders.	Anxiety and depression are among the most common conditions cited by those seeking treatment with complementary and alternative therapies, such as exercise, meditation, tai chi, qigong, and yoga. The use of these therapies is increasing. Several studies of exercise and yoga have demonstrated therapeutic effectiveness superior to no-activity controls and comparable with established depression and anxiety treatments (e.g., cognitive behavior therapy, sertraline, imipramine). High-energy exercise (i.e., weekly expenditure of at least 17.5 kcal per kg) and frequent aerobic exercise (i.e., at least three to five times per week) reduce symptoms of depression more than less frequent or lower-energy exercise. Mindful meditation and exercise have positive effects as adjunctive treatments for depressive disorders, although some studies show multiple methodological weaknesses. For anxiety disorders, exercise and yoga have also shown positive effects, but there are far less data on the effects of exercise on anxiety than for exercise on depression. Tai chi, qigong, and meditation have not shown effectiveness as alternative treatments for depression and anxiety.	Saeed, Sy Atezaz;Antonacci, Diana J;Bloch, Richard M	2010 Apr 15

20382290	Effect of a 12-week yoga intervention on fear of falling and balance in older adults: a pilot study.	OBJECTIVE: To determine whether fear of falling (FoF) and balance improved after a 12-week yoga intervention among older adults. DESIGN: A 12-week yoga intervention single-armed pilot study. SETTING: A retirement community in a medium-sized university town in the Midwest. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of adults (N=14) over the age of 65 years who all endorsed an FoF. INTERVENTION: Each participant took part in a biweekly 12-week yoga intervention. The yoga sessions included both physical postures and breathing exercises. Postures were completed in sitting and standing positions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured FoF with the Illinois FoF Measure and balance with the Berg Balance Scale. Upper- and lower-body flexibility were measured with the back scratch test and chair sit and reach test, respectively. RESULTS: FoF decreased by 6%, static balance increased by 4% (P=.045), and lower-body flexibility increased by 34%. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that yoga may be a promising intervention to manage FoF and improve balance, thereby reducing fall risk for older adults. Rehabilitation therapists may wish to explore yoga as a modality for balance and falls programming; however, future research is needed to confirm the use of yoga in such programming.

20377005	[Pseudoarthrosis of the first rib in a patient who practices yoga. A case report].	INTRODUCTION: Pseudoarthrosis of the first rib is a rare condition that may occur in athletes as a result of repetitive activities, mainly overhead. The usual clinical presentation is pain in the neck or the ipsilateral shoulder. CASE REPORT: This is the case of a 19-year-old female patient who had sudden pain of the base of the neck while doing yoga. Pseudoarthrosis of the first rib was diagnosed with X-rays and CAT scan. Treatment consisted of a rehabilitation and physical therapy program that was successful despite the persistence of the pseudoarthrosis. DISCUSSION: Cases of first rib fractures have been reported in athletes practicing multiple activities; however, pseudoarthrosis cases are rare since most of them progress to bone healing. This is the first reported case of a fracture or pseudoarthrosis in a patient practicing yoga. As in most reported cases, conservative treatment was successful. CONCLUSION: Fractures and pseudoarthrosis of the first rib are rare in athletes and should be included in the differential diagnosis of athletes presenting with shoulder and neck pain. Conservative treatment is successful in most cases.	Tarazona Velutini, Pablo;Romo Rodriiguez, Ranulfo	2009 Nov-Dec
20371148	Influence of sports climbing and yoga on spasticity, cognitive function, mood and fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis.	OBJECTIVES: Spasticity, cognitive impairment, depression and fatigue significantly reduce the quality of life in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. To find out whether nonpharmalogical treatment approaches can reduce these symptoms we investigated effects of sports climbing (SC) and yoga on spasticity, cognitive impairment, mood change and fatigue in MS patients. Sports climbing (SC) and yoga are aerobic physical activities comprised a series of stretching techniques, implementation of which demands body control and planning of complex movements. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 20 subjects with relapsing-remitting or progressive MS, 26-50 years of age, with EDSS<or=6 and EDSS pyramidal functions score (EDSSpyr)>2 were enrolled in a randomized prospective study. The participants were randomly divided into SC and yoga group. We evaluated spasticity, cognitive function, mood and fatigue before and after both programs, that lasted 10 weeks, with standardized assessment methods. RESULTS: There were no significant improvements in spasticity after SC and yoga. In the SC group we found a 25% reduction (p=0.046) in EDSSpyr. There were no differences in executive function after the completion of both programs. There was a 17% increase in selective attention performance after yoga (p=0.005). SC reduced fatigue for 32.5% (p=0.015), while yoga had no effect. We found no significant impact of SC and yoga on mood. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga and SC might improve some of the MS symptoms and should be considered in the future as possible complementary treatments.

20369415	[On the methodological approach to the elucidation of mechanisms underlying therapeutic effectiveness of Cigun, Indian and Tibetan Yoga therapy].	The methodological approach is proposed allowing to objectively characterize neurophysiological mechanisms underlying therapeutic effectiveness of Cigun, Indian and Tibetan Yoga therapy. Execution of exercises stipulated in these programs is interpreted as a consciousness-inspired specific form of human behaviour (activity). Step-by-step analysis of mentally-organized body's functional systems as a neurophysiological basis of realizable behaviour is presented. Operational interpretation of internal mechanisms underlying the system's functioning permits to evaluate the stereotype brain condition actualized by specific requirements and motivations that initiates sensory deprivation to ensure priority realization of internal genetically determined activity of the human body. Mobilization of this internal activity is described as a process of selective formation of many complicated interactions between various structures of the reticular formation, limbic system, subcortical centres, and neocortex maintaining priority functioning of homeostatic mechanisms of self-regulation and inborn human behaviour. These mechanisms are believed to underlie the autoreconstructive potential of human organism by ensuring systemic correction and restoration of its functional resources.

20369218	The effectiveness of yoga for the improvement of well-being and resilience to stress in the workplace.	OBJECTIVES: Recent research has indicated concern for the degree of stress and emotional well-being among university staff. This study examined the effectiveness of yoga in enhancing emotional well-being and resilience to stress among university employees. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial at a British university, we recruited 48 employees and randomized them into either a yoga or a wait-list control group. The yoga group was offered six weeks of Dru Yoga, comprising one 60-minute class per week. These classes were offered by a certified Dru Yoga instructor at lunchtime from January-March 2008. The wait-list control group received no intervention during this six-week study. Baseline and end-program measurements of self-reported mood and well-being were self-assessed with the Profile of Mood States - Bipolar (POMS-Bi) and the Inventory of Positive Psychological Attitudes (IPPA). RESULTS: This six-week yoga intervention resulted in significantly improved POMS-Bi and IPPA scores for the yoga compared to the wait-list control group for seven of eight measures of mood and well-being. In comparison to the wait-list control group at baseline and the end of the program, the yoga group reported marked improvements in feelings of clear-mindedness, composure, elation, energy, and confidence. In addition, the yoga group reported increased life purpose and satisfaction, and feelings of greater self-confidence during stressful situations. CONCLUSION: These results show that even a short program of yoga is effective for enhancing emotional well-being and resilience to stress in the workplace. We suggest that employers should consider offering yoga classes to their employees.	Hartfiel, Ned;Havenhand, Jon;Khalsa, Sat Bir;Clarke, Graham;Krayer, Anne	2011 Jan
20356395	Comparison of yoga versus stretching for chronic low back pain: protocol for the Yoga Exercise Self-care (YES) trial.	BACKGROUND: Back pain, one of the most prevalent conditions afflicting American adults, is the leading reason for using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies. Yoga is an increasingly popular "mind-body" CAM therapy often used for relieving back pain and several small studies have found yoga effective for this condition. This study will assess whether yoga is effective for treating chronic low back pain compared with self care and exercise and will explore the mechanisms responsible for any observed benefits. METHODS/DESIGN: A total of 210 participants with low back pain lasting at least 3 months will be recruited from primary care clinics of a large healthcare system based in Seattle. They will be randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to receive 12 weekly yoga classes, 12 weekly conventional therapeutic exercise classes of comparable physical exertion, or a self-care book. Interviewers masked to participants' treatment group will assess outcomes at baseline and 6, 12 and 26 weeks after randomization. Primary outcomes will be back-related dysfunction and symptom bothersomeness. In addition, data will be collected on physical measurements (e.g., flexion) at baseline and 12 weeks and saliva samples will be obtained at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks. Information will be collected on specific physical, psychological, and physiological factors to allow exploration of possible mechanisms of action through which yoga could relieve back pain and dysfunction. The effectiveness of yoga will be assessed using analysis of covariance (using general estimating equations - GEE) within an intention-to-treat context. If yoga is found effective, further analyses will explore whether yoga's benefits are attributable to physical, psychological and/or physiological factors. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide the clearest evidence to date about the value of yoga as a therapeutic option for treating chronic back pain, and if the results are positive, will help focus future, more in-depth, research on the most promising potential mechanisms of action identified by this study.

27365726	Modalities of Empowerment and Strengthening of Ex-servicemen.	BACKGROUND: Older people including ex-servicemen (ESM) in India are left to fend for themselves due to nuclear family system. Most children are not staying with them due to reasons such as acquiring of education or employment at distant places. These factors, coupled with deteriorating health with advancing age, change in value system and attitude amongst children who give more importance to materialism, it was felt necessary to find modalities to empower and strengthen ESM by available methods of including progressive weight training, yoga and meditation. METHODS: An interventional "Before and After" study was planned for a period of three months for in-patient ESM of a military hospital for common lifestyle diseases namely stroke, diabetes, senile depression, acute myocardial infarction and hypertension. Data of anthropometry, laboratory investigations and Hamilton rating scale for depression (HRSD) were taken before the study. These cases were then subjected to interventions (progressive weight training and spiritual health enhancement by yoga with meditation for three months) followed by same measurements again. RESULT: Statistically significant differences were observed before and after study with respect to pulse, respiratory rate, blood pressure, blood glucose, total cholesterol, low density lipoproteins (LDL), very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and Hamilton depression score (p<0.05). The sleep pattern, sense of well being and posture while sitting to standing and walking with degree of support (stick/other person's help) improved considerably after the interventions. CONCLUSION: ESM are recommended to be trained much before retirement on progressive weight training and yoga in regimental centre/station institute. Provision to be made in existing ex-servicemen contributory health scheme (ECHS) polyclinics for employment of part time trainers for weight training and yoga. The physical and spiritual strengthening results in better capability to deal with old age and its problems.	Harnagle, R;Bhalwar, R;Bhaskar, S V	2010 Apr
22131719	Clinical evaluation of selected Yogic procedures in individuals with low back pain.	The present study has been conducted to evaluate selected yogic procedures on individuals with low back pain. The understanding of back pain as one of the commonest clinical presentations during clinical practice made the path to the present study. It has also been calculated that more than three-quarters of the world's population experience back pain at some time in their lives. Twelve patients were selected and randomly divided into two groups, viz., group A yogic group and group B control group. Advice for life style and diet was given for all the patients. The effect of the therapy was assessed subjectively and objectively. Particular scores drawn for yogic group and control group were individually analyzed before and after treatment and the values were compared using standard statistical protocols. Yogic intervention revealed 79% relief in both subjective and objective parameters (i.e., 7 out of 14 parameters showed statistically highly significant P < 0.01 results, while 4 showed significant results P < 0.05). Comparative effect of yogic group and control group showed 79% relief in both subjective and objective parameters. (i.e., total 6 out of 14 parameters showed statistically highly significant (P < 0.01) results, while 5 showed significant results (P < 0.05).

21836799	Integrated approach to yoga therapy and autism spectrum disorders.	A specially designed Integrated Approach to Yoga Therapy module was applied to Autism Spectrum Disorders over a period of two academic years. Despite low numbers (six in each arm), consistency and magnitude of effects make the findings significant. Parental participation, allowing firm guidance to be given to each child, resulted in significant improvements in imitation and other skills, and in behavior at home and family relationships. We hypothesize that guided imitation of therapist body positions stimulated mirror neuron activation, resulting in improved sense of self.

20347837	A pragmatic multi-centred randomised controlled trial of yoga for chronic low back pain: trial protocol.	UNLABELLED: A systematic review revealed three small randomised controlled trials of yoga for low back pain, all of which showed effects on back pain that favoured the yoga group. To build on these studies a larger trial, with longer term follow-up, and a number of different yoga teachers delivering the intervention is required. This study protocol describes the details of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of Yoga for chronic Low Back Pain, which is funded by Arthritis Research Campaign (arc) and is being conducted by the University of York. 262 patients will be recruited from GP practices in 5 centres in England. Patients will be randomised to receive usual care or 12 weekly classes of yoga. A yoga programme will be devised that can be delivered by yoga teachers of the two main national yoga organisations in the UK (British Wheel of Yoga and Iyengar Yoga Association (UK)). TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current controlled trials registry ISRCTN81079604 (date registered 30/03/2007).

20347834	Effects of yoga on the quality of life in cancer patients.	OBJECTIVE: This study sought to investigate the effects of yoga on the quality of life in patients with breast cancer. DESIGN: Twenty patients between 30 and 50 years of age presently under treatment for breast cancer were included in the study. The physical characteristics of the patients were recorded and general physiotherapy assessments performed. Eight sessions of a yoga program including warming and breathing exercises, asanas, relaxation in supine position, and meditation were applied to participants. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The pre- and post-yoga quality of life assessments for the patients were conducted using the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). Patients' stress levels were assessed using the STAI-I and STAI-II anxiety inventory. Their satisfaction levels about the yoga program was evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS). RESULTS: It was found that patients' quality of life scores after the yoga program were better than scores obtained before the yoga program (p < 0.05). After sessions, there was a statistically significant decrease in their STAI-I (measuring the reactions of anxiety) scores and STAI-II (measuring the permanence of anxiety) scores (p < 0.05). It was found out that the satisfaction score concerning the yoga program was considerably increased after the yoga program (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that yoga is valuable in helping to achieve relaxation and diminish stress, helps cancer patients perform daily and routine activities, and increases the quality of life in cancer patients. This result was positively reflected in patients satisfaction with the yoga program.	Ulger, Ozlem;Yagli, Naciye Vardar	2010 May
20338897	Effects of mindful yoga on sleep in pregnant women: a pilot study.	PURPOSE: The purpose of this experimental pilot study was to measure the effects of a mindfulness-based yoga intervention on sleep in pregnant women. METHODS: Fifteen healthy, nulliparous women in their second or third trimesters with singleton pregnancies attended weekly mindfulness meditation and prenatal Hatha yoga classes in the community for 7 weeks. Sleep variables, as estimated by 72 hr of continuous wrist actigraphy and the General Sleep Disturbance Scale (GSDS), were recorded at baseline (Time 1) and postintervention (Time 2). Control data were obtained by evaluating sleep in the third-trimester group at Time 1. Due to small sample size, data were analyzed using parametric and nonparametric statistics. RESULTS: Women who began the intervention in the second trimester had significantly fewer awakenings, less wake time during the night, and less perceived sleep disturbance at Time 2 than at baseline. Those who began during the third trimester had poorer sleep over time in spite of the intervention. Women who began the intervention in their second trimester had less awake time at Time 2 compared to third-trimester controls at Time 1. CONCLUSIONS: Mindful yoga shows promise for women in their second trimester of pregnancy to diminish total number of awakenings at night and improve sleep efficiency and merits further exploration. Results from this pilot study provide the data to estimate sample size and design and implement powered and more controlled studies in the future.

20332729	Yoga might be an alternative training for the quality of life and balance in postmenopausal osteoporosis.	AIM: Osteoporotic vertebra and hip fractures are major causes of dysfunction, disability, mortality and impaired life quality in the ageing population. In the postmenopausal period, exercises prevent rapid bone loss and increase muscle strength, mobility and flexibility thereby decreasing the risk of falls and fractures. Yoga exercises, which have been an inseparable part of Eastern culture for hundreds of years, are now being used in the field of osteoporosis rehabilitation. Yoga has a positive effect on balance, posture, flexibility, and life quality resulting from its effects on balance, stretching, relaxation and strengthening. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of yoga exercises in postmenopausal osteoporotic women on balance and life quality and to compare the results with a classic osteoporosis exercise program. METHODS: Twenty-six postmenopausal osteoporotic women over 55 years of age were included in the study. A neuromuscular test battery and the QUALEFFO as a life quality index were used for the assessment of balance and life quality, respectively. RESULTS: The results showed that yoga education has a positive effect on pain, physical functions, social functions, general CONCLUSION: In conclusion, yoga appears to be an alternative physical activity for the rehabilitation of osteoporotic subjects.

20307823	Randomized controlled clinical trial of yoga in the treatment of eating disorders.	PURPOSE: This was a pilot project designed to assess the effect of individualized yoga treatment on eating disorder outcomes among adolescents receiving outpatient care for diagnosed eating disorders (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, eating disorder not otherwise specified). METHODS: A total of 50 girls and 4 boys aged 11-21 years were randomized to an 8-week trial of standard care vs. individualized yoga plus standard care. Of these, 27 were randomized to standard care and 26 to yoga plus standard care (attrition: n = 4). Standard care (every other week physician and/or dietician appointments) was required to meet ethical guidelines. The No Yoga group was offered yoga after study completion as an incentive to maintain participation. Outcomes evaluated at baseline, end of trial, and 1-month follow-up included Eating Disorder Examination (EDE), Body Mass Index (BMI), Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Food Preoccupation questionnaire. RESULTS: The Yoga group demonstrated greater decreases in eating disorder symptoms. Specifically, the EDE scores decreased over time in the Yoga group, whereas the No Yoga group showed some initial decline but then returned to baseline EDE levels at week 12. Food preoccupation was measured before and after each yoga session, and decreased significantly after all sessions. Both groups maintained current BMI levels and decreased in anxiety and depression over time. CONCLUSIONS: Individualized yoga treatment decreased EDE scores at 12 weeks, and significantly reduced food preoccupation immediately after yoga sessions. Yoga treatment did not have a negative effect on BMI. Results suggest that individualized yoga therapy holds promise as adjunctive therapy to standard care.

20220611	Effects of yoga on sleep quality and depression in elders in assisted living facilities.	BACKGROUND: Being relocated to an assisted living facility can result in sleep disturbances and depression in elders. This may be attributed to or worsened by lack of regular physical activity. Appropriate exercise programs may be an important component of quality of life in this group of transitional frail elders. PURPOSE: This study aimed to test the effects of a 6-month yoga exercise program in improving sleep quality and decreasing depression in transitional frail elders living in assisted living facilities. METHODS: A quasi-experimental pretest-and-posttest design was used. A convenience sample of 69 elderly residents of assisted living facilities was divided randomly into a yoga exercise (n = 38) and control group (n = 31) based on residence location. A total of 55 participants completed the study. The intervention was implemented in three small groups, and each practice group was led by two pretrained certified yoga instructors three times per week at 70 min per practice session for 24 weeks. The outcome measures of sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and depression state (Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire) were examined at baseline, at the 12th week, and at the 24th week of the study. RESULTS: After 6 months of performing yoga exercises, participants' overall sleep quality had significantly improved, whereas depression, sleep disturbances, and daytime dysfunction had decreased significantly (p < .05). In addition, participants in the intervention group had better results on all outcome indicators than those of participants in the control group (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: It is recommended that yoga exercise be incorporated as an activity program in assisted living facilities or in other long-term care facilities to improve sleep quality and decrease depression in institutionalized elders.

20193089	Post traumatic stress symptoms and heart rate variability in Bihar flood survivors following yoga: a randomized controlled study.	BACKGROUND: An earlier study showed that a week of yoga practice was useful in stress management after a natural calamity. Due to heavy rain and a rift on the banks of the Kosi river, in the state of Bihar in north India, there were floods with loss of life and property. A week of yoga practice was given to the survivors a month after the event and the effect was assessed. METHODS: Twenty-two volunteers (group average age +/- S.D, 31.5 +/- 7.5 years; all of them were males) were randomly assigned to two groups, yoga and a non-yoga wait-list control group. The yoga group practiced yoga for an hour daily while the control group continued with their routine activities. Both groups' heart rate variability, breath rate, and four symptoms of emotional distress using visual analog scales, were assessed on the first and eighth day of the program. RESULTS: There was a significant decrease in sadness in the yoga group (p < 0.05, paired t-test, post data compared to pre) and an increase in anxiety in the control group (p < 0.05, paired t-test, post data compared to pre). CONCLUSIONS: A week of yoga can reduce feelings of sadness and possibly prevent an increase in anxiety in flood survivors a month after the calamity.

20189723	Drinking air and maneuvering it to the pyloric region of the stomach for the treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection.	Helicobacter pylori is a flagellate, gram-negative bacterium which lives in the pyloric region of the human stomach and is a major cause of a large proportion of peptic ulcers, some non-ulcer dyspepsias and rarely, gastric cancers. It is a microaerophilic (anaerobic) organism. In place of the several drugs currently in use for treating H. pylori infection, plain simple atmospheric air swallowed or sucked into the stomach, or drunk by any of the various techniques described here and then posturally maneuvered to the pyloric region by inverting the trunk for a few minutes on a daily basis could be used as a preventive as well as a therapeutic measure for established H. pylori infection. Air is always present in the fundus of stomach, which is the reason why H. pylori does not colonise in the fundal region.	Malshe, P C	2010 Aug
20188996	Prescribing yoga.	More than 15.8 million people in the United States now practice some form of yoga, and nearly half of current practitioners stated they began yoga practice as a means of improving overall health. More broadly understood in a modern context, yoga is a set of principles and practices designed to promote health and well-being through the integration of body, breath, and mind. This article outlines the history of yoga and describes several forms, including asana-based yoga, which is becoming popular in the United States. Research findings related to use of yoga as a therapy for various health problems are reviewed. Guidelines for finding a yoga teacher are offered, as are a number of book and Internet sources of further information.	Hayes, Meg;Chase, Sam	2010 Mar
20183005	Yoga and sexual functioning: a review.	Yoga is an ancient practice with Eastern roots that involves both physical postures (asanas) and breathing techniques (pranayamas). There is also a cognitive component focusing on meditation and concentration, which aids in achieving the goal of union between the self and the spiritual. Although numerous empirical studies have found a beneficial effect of yoga on different aspects of physical and psychological functioning, claims of yoga's beneficial effects on sexuality derive from a rich but nonempirical literature. The goal of this article is to review the philosophy and forms of yoga, to review the nonempirical and (limited) empirical literatures linking yoga with enhanced sexuality, and to propose some future research avenues focusinging on yoga as a treatment for sexual complaints.

20180691	Complementary and alternative medicine and supportive care at leading cancer centers: a systematic analysis of websites.	BACKGROUND: With increasing frequency, patients with cancer and their family members are turning to the Internet to educate themselves about their disease and treatment options, including complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and supportive care. However, very little is known about how national leading cancer centers represent these therapies via their websites. METHODS: Simulating the perspective of an information-seeking patient or family member, we performed a systematic analysis of the websites of 41 National Cancer Institute designated comprehensive cancer centers. Two researchers independently evaluated websites, recorded CAM information, and rated quality of the websites using a 4-item Likert scale (overall, information, presentation, and navigation) with Cronbach's alpha = 0.97. Rating was adequately correlated between the two raters (correlation coefficient 0.8). RESULTS: Of 41 centers, 12 (29%) did not have functional websites with regard to information related to CAM. The most common CAM approaches mentioned were: acupuncture (59%), meditation/nutrition/spiritual support/yoga (56% for each), massage therapy (54%), and music therapy (51%). Twenty-three (23; 56%) presented information on support groups, 19 (46%) on patient seminars, 18 (44%) on survivorship effort, and 17 (41%) on symptom management clinics. Twenty-nine (29) (71%) of these websites had a telephone number available, 22 (54%) mentioned at least one ongoing research opportunity, and 19 (46%) provided links to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine website. Median rating of the quality of websites was 50 of 100, with only 7 (17%) of centers receiving a composite score 80 (excellent) or better. CONCLUSIONS: While a growing number of leading cancer centers provide information about CAM and supportive oncology information for patients via their websites, the quality and ease of navigation of these sites remain highly variable. Effective development and redesign of many of the websites is needed to better inform and empower patients and families seeking CAM and supportive care information.

20178291	Effect of a yoga practice session and a yoga theory session on state anxiety.	Yoga techniques practiced for varying durations have been shown to reduce state anxiety. In this study, there were 300 naive-to-yoga persons of both sexes who were attending a yoga therapy center in north India for stress relief as day visitors and were not residing at the center. They were assigned to two groups, yoga practice and yoga theory, and their state anxiety was assessed before and after a 2-hr. yoga session. A significant reduction in scores on state anxiety was found in the yoga practice group (14.7% decrease), as well as in the yoga theory group (3.4% decrease). The difference in scores following the sessions was statistically significant. Hence, yoga practice as well as learning about theoretical aspects of yoga appear to reduce state anxiety, with a greater reduction following yoga practice.

20178266	Meditative states based on yoga texts and their effects on performance of a letter-cancellation task.	Performance in a six-letter cancellation task was studied in 35 male experienced meditators with experience ranging from 6 to 12 months. Each participant was studied in four sessions, two Meditation and two Control sessions. The Control sessions were (i) Cancalata or nontargeted thinking and (ii) Ekagrata or focusing on a single topic, in this case, meditation. The Meditation sessions were (i) Dharana or focusing on the symbol "OM" and (ii) Dhyana or an effortless single-thought (of OM) state. Ekagrata and dharana differ in that the former involves focusing with multiple thoughts whereas the latter involves focusing with a single thought, i.e., the significance of OM. The net scores on the six-letter cancellation task were significantly higher after a session of Dharana and lower after the Cancalata session, while there was no significant change after Ekagrata and Dhyana sessions. Focusing on the symbol OM in Dharana may favorably influence selective attention, concentration, visual scanning abilities, and a repetitive motor response compared to other sessions.

20167444	Mind-body therapies for menopausal symptoms: a systematic review.	OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the peer-reviewed literature regarding the effects of self-administered mind-body therapies on menopausal symptoms. METHODS: To identify qualifying studies, we searched 10 scientific databases and scanned bibliographies of relevant review papers and all identified articles. The methodological quality of all studies was assessed systematically using predefined criteria. RESULTS: Twenty-one papers representing 18 clinical trials from 6 countries met our inclusion criteria, including 12 randomized controlled trials (N=719), 1 non-randomized controlled trial (N=58), and 5 uncontrolled trials (N=105). Interventions included yoga and/or meditation-based programs, tai chi, and other relaxation practices, including muscle relaxation and breath-based techniques, relaxation response training, and low-frequency sound-wave therapy. Eight of the nine studies of yoga, tai chi, and meditation-based programs reported improvement in overall menopausal and vasomotor symptoms; six of seven trials indicated improvement in mood and sleep with yoga-based programs, and four studies reported reduced musculoskeletal pain. Results from the remaining nine trials suggest that breath-based and other relaxation therapies also show promise for alleviating vasomotor and other menopausal symptoms, although intergroup findings were mixed. Most studies reviewed suffered methodological or other limitations, complicating interpretation of findings. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, findings of these studies suggest that yoga-based and certain other mind-body therapies may be beneficial for alleviating specific menopausal symptoms. However, the limitations characterizing most studies hinder interpretation of findings and preclude firm conclusions regarding efficacy. Additional large, methodologically sound trials are needed to determine the effects of specific mind-body therapies on menopausal symptoms, examine long-term outcomes, and investigate underlying mechanisms.

20165628	Community-based Randomized Controlled Trial of Non-pharmacological Interventions in Prevention and Control of Hypertension among Young Adults.	CONTEXT: Hypertension is a major chronic lifestyle disease. Several non-pharmacological interventions are effective in bringing down the blood pressure (BP). This study focuses on the effectiveness of such interventions among young adults. AIMS: To measure the efficacy of physical exercise, reduction in salt intake, and yoga, in lowering BP among young (20-25) pre-hypertensives and hypertensives, and to compare their relative efficacies. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: The study was done in the urban service area of JIPMER. Pre-hypertensives and hypertensives, identified from previous studies, constituted the universe. The participants were randomized into one control and three interventional groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 113 subjects: 30, 28, 28 and 27 in four groups respectively participated for eight weeks: control (I), physical exercise (II) - brisk walking for 50-60 minutes, four days/week, salt intake reduction (III) - to at least half of their previous intake, and practice of yoga (IV) - for 30-45 minutes/day on at least five days/week. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Efficacy was assessed using paired t test and ANOVA with Games Howell post hoc test. An intention to treat analysis was also performed. RESULTS: A total of 102 participants (29, 27, 25 and 21 in groups I, II, III and IV) completed the study. All three intervention groups showed a significant reduction in BP (SBP/DBP: 5.3/6.0 in group II, 2.6/3.7 in III, and 2.0/2.6 mm Hg in IV respectively). There was no significant change (SBP/DBP: 0.2/0.5 mmHg) of BP in control group (I). Physical exercise was most effective (considered individually); salt intake reduction and yoga were also effective. CONCLUSIONS: Physical exercise, salt intake reduction, and yoga are effective non-pharmacological interventions in significantly reducing BP among young hypertensives and pre-hypertensives. These can therefore be positively recommended for hypertensives. There is also a case to deploy these interventions in the general population.

20154584	Unusual body posture after death leading to signs of strangulation.	This report concerns a case in which the decedent was found in a highly unusual posture, one resembling a yoga backbend pose. Several findings in this case pointed to death by strangulation, including facial congestion, extensive petechiae of the conjunctivae and mucosal membranes of the oral cavity, and congestion and hemorrhaging in the lingual root, laryngopharynx, and cervical lymph nodes. However, no hemorrhaging of the cervical skin or soft tissue was observed. The cause of death was ultimately identified as pulmonary thromboembolism caused by an embolus originating from a deep leg vein thrombosis. If the pulmonary thromboembolism had not been detected, the cause of death may have been misidentified as strangulation.	Asamura, Hideki;Oki, Takahito;Masao, Ota;Fukushima, Hirofumi	2010 Jun
20112821	A study of the effect of yoga training on pulmonary functions in patients with bronchial asthma.	The role of yoga breathing exercises, as an adjunct treatment for bronchial asthma is well recognized. One hundred twenty patients of asthma were randomized into two groups i.e Group A (yoga training group) and Group B (control group). Each group included sixty patients. Pulmonary function tests were performed on all the patients at baseline, after 4 weeks and then after 8 weeks. Majority of the subjects in the two groups had mild disease (34 patients in Group A and 32 in Group B). Group A subjects showed a statistically significant increasing trend (P < 0.01) in % predicted peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced mid expiratory flow in 0.25-0.75 seconds (FEF25-75) and FEV1/FVC% ratio at 4 weeks and 8 weeks as compared to Group B. Thus, yoga breathing exercises used adjunctively with standard pharmacological treatment significantly improves pulmonary functions in patients with bronchial asthma.

20105062	The health benefits of yoga and exercise: a review of comparison studies.	OBJECTIVES: Exercise is considered an acceptable method for improving and maintaining physical and emotional health. A growing body of evidence supports the belief that yoga benefits physical and mental health via down-regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The purpose of this article is to provide a scholarly review of the literature regarding research studies comparing the effects of yoga and exercise on a variety of health outcomes and health conditions. METHODS: Using PubMed((R)) and the key word "yoga," a comprehensive search of the research literature from core scientific and nursing journals yielded 81 studies that met inclusion criteria. These studies subsequently were classified as uncontrolled (n = 30), wait list controlled (n = 16), or comparison (n = 35). The most common comparison intervention (n = 10) involved exercise. These studies were included in this review. RESULTS: In the studies reviewed, yoga interventions appeared to be equal or superior to exercise in nearly every outcome measured except those involving physical fitness. CONCLUSIONS: The studies comparing the effects of yoga and exercise seem to indicate that, in both healthy and diseased populations, yoga may be as effective as or better than exercise at improving a variety of health-related outcome measures. Future clinical trials are needed to examine the distinctions between exercise and yoga, particularly how the two modalities may differ in their effects on the SNS/HPA axis. Additional studies using rigorous methodologies are needed to examine the health benefits of the various types of yoga.	Ross, Alyson;Thomas, Sue	2010 Jan
20098228	Hatha yoga for depression: critical review of the evidence for efficacy, plausible mechanisms of action, and directions for future research.	BACKGROUND: The purpose of this article is to review the evidence for the efficacy of hatha yoga for depression and possible mechanisms by which yoga may have an impact on depression, and to outline directions for future research. METHODS: Literature review and synthesis. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A literature search for clinical trials examining yoga for depression uncovered eight trials: 5 including individuals with clinical depression, and 3 for individuals with elevated depression symptoms. Although results from these trials are encouraging, they should be viewed as very preliminary because the trials, as a group, suffered from substantial methodological limitations. We would argue, however, that there are several reasons to consider constructing careful research on yoga for depression. First, current strategies for treating depression are not sufficient for many individuals, and patients have several concerns about existing treatments. Yoga may be an attractive alternative to or a good way to augment current depression treatment strategies. Second, aspects of yoga-including mindfulness promotion and exercise-are thought to be "active ingredients" of other successful treatments for depression. Third, there are plausible biological, psychological, and behavioral mechanisms by which yoga may have an impact on depression. We provide suggestions for the next steps in the study of yoga as a treatment for depression.

20088655	Demographic, behavioral, and health correlates of complementary and alternative medicine and prayer use among midlife women: 2002.	OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the demographic, behavioral, and health correlates of the most frequently used types of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapy and the use of prayer for health among midlife women. We also examined the extent to which women used CAM for treatment of health conditions, including menopausal symptoms, and for general health and well-being. METHODS: Data from the 2002 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a cross-sectional, household survey representative of the U.S. civilian adult population, were used. Midlife women aged 40-59 years (n = 5849) were analyzed. Bivariate prevalence estimates were obtained, and binomial logistic regression models were estimated; all analyses were weighted. RESULTS: Overall, 46% of midlife women used any type of CAM in the past 12 months, and 54% reported using prayer for health reasons. The top five specific CAM therapies used were herbs and natural products; relaxation techniques; chiropractic care; yoga, tai chi, or qi gong; and massage. Multivariate results demonstrated different patterns of association between demographic, health, and behavioral characteristics and specific CAM therapies. A higher percentage of women used chiropractic care for an existing health condition than those using relaxation techniques, and few women used CAM specifically for menopausal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: CAM and prayer are frequently used by midlife women, and herbs and natural supplements are the mostly frequently used. The findings underscore the importance, particularly in the clinical setting, of asking women about their use of individual CAM therapies. Such clinical assessment is also important because of the potential for interactions of CAM therapies with prescribed therapies.

20064902	Stress, inflammation, and yoga practice.	OBJECTIVE: To address the mechanisms underlying hatha yoga's potential stress-reduction benefits, we compared inflammatory and endocrine responses of novice and expert yoga practitioners before, during, and after a restorative hatha yoga session, as well as in two control conditions. Stressors before each of the three conditions provided data on the extent to which yoga speeded an individual's physiological recovery. METHODS: A total of 50 healthy women (mean age, 41.32 years; range, 30-65 years), 25 novices and 25 experts, were exposed to each of the conditions (yoga, movement control, and passive-video control) during three separate visits. RESULTS: The yoga session boosted participants' positive affect compared with the control conditions, but no overall differences in inflammatory or endocrine responses were unique to the yoga session. Importantly, even though novices and experts did not differ on key dimensions, including age, abdominal adiposity, and cardiorespiratory fitness, novices' serum interleukin (IL)-6 levels were 41% higher than those of experts across sessions, and the odds of a novice having detectable C-reactive protein (CRP) were 4.75 times as high as that of an expert. Differences in stress responses between experts and novices provided one plausible mechanism for their divergent serum IL-6 data; experts produced less lipopolysaccharide-stimulated IL-6 in response to the stressor than novices, and IL-6 promotes CRP production. CONCLUSION: The ability to minimize inflammatory responses to stressful encounters influences the burden that stressors place on an individual. If yoga dampens or limits stress-related changes, then regular practice could have substantial health benefits.

20060076	Results of laparoscopic cholecystectomy without energized dissection: a prospective study.	INTRODUCTION: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) a gold standard treatment of symptomatic gall stone disease has yet to become as safe as open cholecystectomy. The concerns of safety for both surgeon as well as patient are present even after the passage of "learning curve" phase. Emphasis on experience and technique have helped but for the morbidity associated with the use of energy sources. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possibility of avoiding this morbidity by not using energy sources in LC. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Prospective case series, with a minimum follow up of 1 year. Consecutive, unselected patients of symptomatic gall stone disease operated by an experienced laparoscopic surgeon from July 2003-June 2005. Operative, early and late postoperative outcomes were evaluated. TECHNIQUE: LC was performed by dissecting in avascular Holy planes without using any energy source. RESULTS: LC could be performed safely in all 135 patients. The technique was uniformly applicable irrespective of gender, age, time of presentation, grade of inflammation, adhesions or any comorbidity. There was no hemodynamic instability, conversion, injury manifesting early or late or any mortality. CONCLUSION: The potential injury from use of energy sources in LC can be avoided as it can be safely performed without using any energy source.	Agarwal, Brij B	2010
20059570	Yoga lifestyle intervention reduces blood pressure in HIV-infected adults with cardiovascular disease risk factors.	OBJECTIVE: People living with HIV infection are at increased risk for developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). Safe and effective interventions for lowering CVD risk in HIV infection are high priorities. We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled study to evaluate whether a yoga lifestyle intervention improves CVD risk factors, virological or immunological status, or quality of life (QOL) in HIV-infected adults relative to standard of care treatment in a matched control group. METHODS: Sixty HIV-infected adults with mild-moderate CVD risk were assigned to 20 weeks of supervised yoga practice or standard of care treatment. Baseline and week 20 measures were: 2-h oral glucose tolerance test with insulin monitoring, body composition, fasting serum lipid/lipoprotein profile, resting blood pressures, CD4 T-cell count and plasma HIV RNA, and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF)-36 health-related QOL inventory. RESULTS: Resting systolic and diastolic blood pressures improved more (P=0.04) in the yoga group (-5 +/- 2 and -3 +/- 1 mmHg, respectively) than in the standard of care group (+1 +/- 2 and+2 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively). However, there was no greater reduction in body weight, fat mass or proatherogenic lipids, or improvements in glucose tolerance or overall QOL after yoga. Immune and virological status was not adversely affected. CONCLUSION: Among traditional lifestyle modifications, yoga is a low-cost, simple to administer, nonpharmacological, popular behavioural intervention that can lower blood pressure in pre-hypertensive HIV-infected adults with mild-moderate CVD risk factors.

20046213	Personality, Menopausal Symptoms, and Physical Activity Outcomes in Middle-Aged Women.	The menopausal transition is characterized by increased reporting of various symptoms, however, little is known about what underlies individual differences in their reporting. The present study examined the contribution of personality factors to the reporting of menopausal symptoms in the context of a 4-month randomized controlled exercise trial. Symptomatic middle-aged women (N = 164 M age = 49.9, SD = 3.6) completed measures of menopausal symptoms, personality, physical activity, fitness and body composition assessment at the beginning and end of a 4-month randomized controlled trial involving walking and yoga. After controlling for baseline values, psychological symptoms at the end of the trial were associated with trait anxiety (beta = .47, p < .001) and changes in fitness (beta = -.20, p < .01); vasomotor symptoms with optimism (beta = -.18, p < .05) and changes in fitness (beta = -.15, p = .053); and sexual symptoms were associated with changes in fitness (beta = -.16, p < .05). Personality characteristics partially explain symptom reports during menopause however improvements in physical parameters such as fitness may reduce reported symptomatology.

20044334	Gender, symptom experience, and use of complementary and alternative medicine practices among cancer survivors in the U.S. cancer population.	PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To identify relationships among gender, physical and psychological symptoms (pain, insomnia, fatigue, and depression), and use of specific complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practices among survivors in the U.S. cancer population. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of the 2002 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). The CAM Healthcare Model, an extension of the Behavioral Model for Health Services Use, guided the study. SETTING: United States. SAMPLE: 2,262 adults (aged 18 years and older) diagnosed with cancer representing more than 14.3 million cancer survivors in the United States . METHODS: NHIS interview data on use of CAM practices (diet, yoga, tai chi, qigong, meditation, guided imagery, relaxation, and deep breathing) were examined in relationship to gender and symptoms. Analysis was conducted using Stata 9.2 software for population estimation. Binary logistic regression, the primary statistical model employed in the analysis, focused on between-subject differences in practice use. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Dichotomous outcome variables included use of at least one CAM practice and use of specific individual CAM practices. Independent variables included gender, age, education, race, provider contact, cancer diagnosis, pain, insomnia, fatigue, depression, and health status. FINDINGS: CAM practice use was more prevalent among female, middle-aged, Caucasian, and well-educated subjects. Pain, depression, and insomnia were strong predictors of practice use, with differences noted by gender and practice type. CONCLUSIONS: CAM practices are widely used in the U.S. cancer population, especially among women. Symptom experience influences likelihood of use, with increased odds when men report symptoms. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Study findings inform oncology nurses on the benefits of integrating self-care CAM practices in relationship to gender into the symptom management care plan for cancer survivors. Findings reported in this study will help guide future CAM practice intervention studies.	Fouladbakhsh, Judith M;Stommel, Manfred	2010 Jan
22557353	Establishing the Scientific Validity of Tridosha part 1: Doshas, Subdoshas and Dosha Prakritis.	In traditional Ayurdev, basic concepts such as Tridosa are introduced didactically. Students of Ayurdeva learn to appreciate their practical value through experience; their validity is empirical. In an age where validity of concepts is judged by their scientific relevance, establishing the scientific validity of Tridosha is a program of significance. It requires translating concept and practical application into the idiom of modern biology and medicine. Four different complementary approaches have been proposed to do so: factor analysis of human physiology; systems analysis of organism function; correlation of Dosha and genomic variations - Ayugenomics; and correlation of Dosha and cellular function. Together these four independent approaches present compelling evidence that the family of Dosha based, Ayurveda fundamental concepts - the three Doshas, their fifteen subdoshas, innate Dosha balance in the individual (prakriti), and Dosha imbalances (vikriti) are scientifically valid. This paper concerns the first three. (I) The systems approach shows how Tridosha applies to every living organism from the first cells, and how it is inherited and diversified in the history of life. (2) Ayugenomics confirms Dosha's inheritance. (3) Each Dosha is responsible for regulating an essential aspect of organism function, connected to a recognised definition of life: Vata, Input/Output (homeostasis); Pitta, Turnover (negative entropy production); Kapha, Storage (inheritable structure).

22314829	Potential yoga modules for treatment of hematopoietic inhibition in HIV-1 infection.	This article is expected to contribute towards understanding the therapeutic benefits of specific yoga modules on the inhibition of replication and enhancement to normal levels of hematopoiesis in HIV-1 infected subjects. More unique could be the effects of yoga on the indirect effects of HIV-1 induced hematopoietic inhibition of the CD34+ progenitor stem cells, via the CD4+ T lymphocytes. Such indirect effects may be caused by host cellular factors. Yoga practices may also improve the self renewal capacity (a step that precedes commitment of CD34+ progenitor cells to terminal differentiation), via STAT5 gene regulation. This may eliminate the need for constitutive STAT5 gene expression through gene therapy. In this article recent research and ancient Indian literature are reviewed to devise yoga modules for the potential treatment of hematopoietic inhibition in HIV-1 infection. The possible mechanisms through which hematopoietic inhibition may occur in HIV-1 infected patients are first described followed by the role of stress in the progression of HIV where probable involvement of psycho-neuro-immunological axis (PNI) is highlighted. Yoga therapy is introduced and its effectiveness in terms of evidence in relevant area is reviewed. Further, the basic principles of Integrated Approach of Yoga Therapy [IAYT] are described and depending on the potential mechanisms through which yoga therapy may act, both modern scientific research and ancient "scriptural" evidence are provided at all the five levels of existence (body, life force, emotional, intellectual and bliss). This will enable to design comprehensive yoga modules that may intervene in this indirect inhibition of haematopoiesis in HIV-1 infected individuals and potentially restore normal levels of haematopoiesis.

22131688	Clinical Study of An Ayurvedic Compound (Divyadi Yoga) in the Management of Shayyamutrata (enuresis).	Child health has assumed great significance in all over world. Its importance is being realized more and more by pediatricians and general public in developing as well as developed countries. Enuresis is defined as the voluntary or involuntary repeated discharge of urine into clothes or bed after a developmental age when bladder control should be established. The present clinical study was planned to evaluate the effect of Divyadi Yoga along with counseling in the management of Shayyamutra. Total 40 selected cases were divided into two groups, i.e. 20 in each group. One group of children were given the trial drug Divyadi Yoga (D(1)) with counseling and other group of children were given placebo Divyadi Yoga (D(2)) with counseling. Divyadi Yoga was given in the dose of 3-6 gms. twice a day with luke warm water. The result of the study showed that groups provided a highly significant.	Jain, C M;Gupta, Anju	2010 Jan

21694790	Efficacy of behavioral intervention in reducing anxiety and depression among medical students.	BACKGROUND: Now a days, college students frequently have more complex problems than they used to have over a decade ago - greater difficulties in relationships; and more severe problems, such as depression, anxiety and thoughts of suicide. Counseling helps students to understand themselves and the world around them, and to adjust themselves more efficiently and appropriately to other fellow beings. AIM: To determine as to what extent the medical students were able to cope up with their anxiety and depression with the help of counseling. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the experimental design 'Before-and -after with control design', Beck Anxiety Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory were administered to 120 medical students who were randomly selected from a private medical college, comprising of 30 males and 30 females in each of the two groups, viz., the experimental group and the control group. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Means, standard deviations, t test and one-way ANOVA were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Anxiety and depression among the students were found to be reduced after counseling. Male and female students in the experimental group showed decrease in the levels of anxiety and depression; whereas the control group, which did not get the benefit of counseling, continued to have the same levels of anxiety and depression. CONCLUSION: Counseling is helpful in building self-confidence and the capacity to adjust, by reducing anxiety and depression among medical college students.

21429248	Epilepsy (partial).	INTRODUCTION: About 3% of people will be diagnosed with epilepsy during their lifetime, but about 70% of people with epilepsy eventually go into remission. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of starting antiepileptic drug treatment following a single seizure? What are the effects of drug monotherapy in people with partial epilepsy? What are the effects of additional drug treatments in people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy? What is the risk of relapse in people in remission when withdrawing antiepileptic drugs? What are the effects of behavioural and psychological treatments for people with epilepsy? What are the effects of surgery in people with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 83 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antiepileptic drugs after a single seizure; monotherapy for partial epilepsy using carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, phenytoin, sodium valproate, or topiramate; addition of second-line drugs for drug-resistant partial epilepsy (allopurinol, eslicarbazepine, gabapentin, lacosamide, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, losigamone, oxcarbazepine, retigabine, tiagabine, topiramate, vigabatrin, or zonisamide); antiepileptic drug withdrawal for people with partial or generalised epilepsy who are in remission; behavioural and psychological treatments for partial or generalised epilepsy (biofeedback, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), educational programmes, family counselling, relaxation therapy (alone or plus behavioural modification therapy, yoga); and surgery for drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy ( lesionectomy, temporal lobectomy, vagus nerve stimulation as adjunctive therapy).

20038010	Performance on psychomotor tasks following two yoga-based relaxation techniques.	Previously cyclic meditation and supine rest have been shown to improve performance in a letter cancellation task requiring attention, visual scanning, and motor speed. The present study assessed the performance in 57 volunteers (all male, M age = 26.5 yr., SD = 4.6) in three tasks, viz., a digit-letter substitution task (DLST), a letter-copying task, and a circle-dotting task. The DLST assessed attention and speed of information processing, while the other 2 tests assessed motor speed. Each participant was assessed before and after three types of sessions: Cyclic Meditation, Supine Rest, and Control (no intervention). DLST scores and scores for letter-copying and circle-dotting tasks improved significantly after cyclic meditation; the same scores also improved after supine rest. There was no change after the no-intervention/Control session. From the results it was difficult to conclude whether improved DLST scores after cyclic meditation were due to better information processing speed or improved motor speed.

20037492	Short term health impact of a yoga and diet change program on obesity.	BACKGROUND: Obese persons often find physical activity difficult. The effects of a yoga and diet change program, emphasizing breathing techniques practiced while seated, was assessed in obese persons. MATERIAL/METHODS: A single group of 47 persons were assessed on the first and last day of a yoga and diet change program, with 6 days of the intervention between assessments. The assessments were: body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumferences, mid-arm circumference, body composition, hand grip strength, postural stability, serum lipid profile and fasting serum leptin levels. Participants practiced yoga for 5 hours every day and had a low fat, high fiber, vegetarian diet. Last and first day data were compared using a t-test for paired data. RESULTS: Following the 6-day residential program, participants showed a decrease in BMI (1.6 percent), waist and hip circumferences, fat-free mass, total cholesterol (7.7 percent decrease), high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (8.7 percent decrease), fasting serum leptin levels (44.2 percent decrease) and an increase in postural stability and hand grip strength (p<0.05, all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: A 6-day yoga and diet change program decreased the BMI and the fat-free mass. Total cholesterol also decreased due to reduced HDL levels. This suggests that a brief, intensive yoga program with a change in diet can pose certain risks. Benefits seen were better postural stability, grip strength (though a 'practice effect' was not ruled out), reduced waist and hip circumferences and a decrease in serum leptin levels.

20006289	Functional fitness improvements after a worksite-based yoga initiative.	This study explored the benefits of yoga on functional fitness, flexibility, and perceived stress. A quasi-experimental design was used to measure benefits of yoga in sample of firefighters from a major metropolitan fire department. Yoga classes were conducted on-shift, in the fire stations over the period of 6 weeks. The classes included pranayama (breathing), asana (postures), and savasana (relaxation); 108 firefighters enrolled in the study, most were physically active but had no prior experience with yoga. Baseline and post-yoga assessments were completed by 77 participants. Paired t-tests revealed significant improvements in the Functional Movement Screen, a seven item test that measures functional fitness. Improvements were also noted in trunk flexibility and perceived stress. Participants also reported favorable perceptions of yoga: feeling more focused and less musculoskeletal pain. These findings - along with the retention of the majority of the participants - indicate that participants benefited from yoga.	Cowen, Virginia S	2010 Jan
19997034	METs in adults while playing active video games: a metabolic chamber study.	PURPOSE: Active video game systems controlled through arm gestures and motions (Nintendo Wii Sports) and video games controlled through force plate (Wii Fit Plus) are becoming increasingly popular. This study was performed to determine the energy expenditure (EE) during Wii Fit Plus and Wii Sports game activities. METHODS: Twelve adult men and women performed all the activities of Wii Sports (five activities: golf, bowling, tennis, baseball, and boxing) and Wii Fit Plus (63 activities classified as yoga, resistance, balance, and aerobic exercises). Each activity was continued for at least 8 min to obtain a steady-state EE. Because EE was assessed in an open-circuit indirect metabolic chamber consisting of an airtight room (20,000 or 15,000 L), subjects were freed of apparatus to collect expired gas while playing the games. MET value was calculated from resting EE and steady-state EE during activity. RESULTS: The mean MET values of all 68 activities were distributed over a wide range from 1.3 METs (Lotus Focus) to 5.6 METs (single-arm stand). The mean MET values in yoga, balance, resistance, and aerobic exercise of Wii Fit Plus and Wii Sports were 2.1, 2.0, 3.2, 3.4, and 3.0 METs, respectively. Forty-six activities (67%) were classified as light intensity (<3 METs), and 22 activities (33%) were classified as moderate intensity (3.0-6.0 METs). There were no vigorous-intensity activities (>6.0 METs). CONCLUSIONS: Time spent playing one-third of the activities supplied by motion- and gesture-controlled video games can count toward the daily amount of exercise required according to the guidelines provided by the American College of Sports Medicine and the American Heart Association, which focus on 30 min of moderate-intensity daily physical activity 5 d x wk(-1).

19952833	Benefits of yoga for African American heart failure patients.	BACKGROUND: The number of African American (AA) patients living with heart failure (HF) has been increasing, especially among the economically disadvantaged. Yoga therapy has been found to improve physical and psychological parameters among healthy individuals, but its effect in patients with HF remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of yoga therapy on cardiovascular endurance (VO2peak), flexibility, quality of life (QoL), and inflammatory markers on medically stable HF patients. METHODS: Forty patients (38 AA, 1 Asian, and 1 Caucasian) with systolic or diastolic HF were randomized to the yoga group (YG, n = 21) or the control group (CG, n = 19). All patients were asked to follow a home walk program. Premeasurement and postmeasurement included a treadmill stress test to peak exertion, flexibility, interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD). QoL was assessed by the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLwHFQ). RESULTS: The statistical analyses (assessed by ANOVA and t-tests) were significant for favorable changes in the YG, compared with those in the CG, for flexibility (P = 0.012), treadmill time (P = 0.002), VO2peak (P = 0.003), and the biomarkers (IL-6, P = 0.004; CRP, P = 0.016; and EC-SOD, P = 0.012). Within the YG, pretest to posttest scores for the total (P = 0.02) and physical subscales (P < 0.001) of the MLwHFQ were improved. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga therapy offered additional benefits to the standard medical care of predominantly AA HF patients by improving cardiovascular endurance, QoL, inflammatory markers, and flexibility.

19949871	Mindfulness and levels of stress: a comparison of beginner and advanced Hatha Yoga practitioners.	The present study was designed to examine mindfulness and stress levels in beginner and advanced practitioners of Hatha Yoga. Participants (N = 52) were recruited through Hatha Yoga schools local to western Massachusetts. Beginner practitioners (n = 24) were designated as those with under 5 years (M = 3.33) experience and advanced practitioners (n = 28) as those with over 5 years (M = 14.53) experience in Hatha Yoga. The participants completed the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS; Brown and Ryan 2003) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen et al. 1983) directly preceding a regularly scheduled Hatha Yoga class. Based on two independent-samples t-tests, advanced participants scored significantly higher in mindfulness levels (P < .05) and significantly lower in stress levels (P < .05) when compared to beginner participants. Additionally, a significant negative correlation (r = -.45, P = .00) was found between mindfulness and stress levels. No significant correlations were found between experience levels and mindfulness and stress levels. Hatha Yoga may be an effective technique for enhancing mindfulness and decreasing stress levels in practitioners.	Brisbon, Nicholas M;Lowery, Glenn A	2011 Dec

19943573	Yoga for chronic low back pain in a predominantly minority population: a pilot randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Several studies suggest yoga may be effective for chronic low back pain; however, trials targeting minorities have not been conducted. PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVES: Assess the feasibility of studying yoga in a predominantly minority population with chronic low back pain. Collect preliminary data to plan a larger powered study. STUDY DESIGN: Pilot randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Two community health centers in a racially diverse neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty English-speaking adults (mean age 44 years, 83% female, 83% racial/ethnic minorities; 48% with incomes < or = $30,000) with moderate-to-severe chronic low back pain. INTERVENTIONS: Standardized series of weekly hatha yoga classes for 12 weeks compared to a waitlist usual care control. OUTCOME MEASURES: Feasibility measured by time to complete enrollment, proportion of racial/ethnic minorities enrolled, retention rates, and adverse events. Primary efficacy outcomes were changes from baseline to 12 weeks in pain score (0=no pain to 10=worst possible pain) and back-related function using the modified Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (0-23 point scale, higher scores reflect poorer function). Secondary efficacy outcomes were analgesic use, global improvement, and quality of life (SF-36). RESULTS: Recruitment took 2 months. Retention rates were 97% at 12 weeks and 77% at 26 weeks. Mean pain scores for yoga decreased from baseline to 12 weeks (6.7 to 4.4) compared to usual care, which decreased from 7.5 to 7.1 (P=.02). Mean Roland scores for yoga decreased from 14.5 to 8.2 compared to usual care, which decreased from 16.1 to 12.5 (P=.28). At 12 weeks, yoga compared to usual care participants reported less analgesic use (13% vs 73%, P=.003), less opiate use (0% vs 33%, P=.04), and greater overall improvement (73% vs 27%, P=.03). There were no differences in SF-36 scores and no serious adverse events. CONCLUSION: A yoga study intervention in a predominantly minority population with chronic low back pain was moderately feasible and may be more effective than usual care for reducing pain and pain medication use.

19942107	Effects of yoga program on quality of life and affect in early breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy: a randomized controlled trial.	OBJECTIVES: This study compares the effects of an integrated yoga program with brief supportive therapy in breast cancer outpatients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy at a cancer centre. METHODS: Eighty-eight stage II and III breast cancer outpatients were randomly assigned to receive yoga (n = 44) or brief supportive therapy (n = 44) prior to their radiotherapy treatment. Intervention consisted of yoga sessions lasting 60 min daily while the control group was imparted supportive therapy once in 10 days. Assessments included European Organization for Research in the Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life (EORTCQoL C30) functional scales and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Assessments were done at baseline and after 6 weeks of radiotherapy treatment. RESULTS: An intention to treat GLM repeated measures ANOVA showed significant difference across groups over time for positive affect, negative affect and emotional function and social function. There was significant improvement in positive affect (ES = 0.59, p = 0.007, 95%CI 1.25 to 7.8), emotional function (ES = 0.71, p = 0.001, 95%CI 6.45 to 25.33) and cognitive function (ES = 0.48, p = 0.03, 95%CI 1.2 to 18.5), and decrease in negative affect (ES = 0.84, p<0.001, 95%CI -13.4 to -4.4) in the yoga group as compared to controls. There was a significant positive correlation between positive affect with role function, social function and global quality of life. There was a significant negative correlation between negative affect with physical function, role function, emotional function and social function. CONCLUSION: The results suggest a possible role for yoga to improve quality of life and affect in breast cancer outpatients.

19916343	Yoga for children.	There is an increasing interest in the use of yoga for children to calm the mind and increase health and well being. Despite scant but increasing evidence supporting the efficacy of yoga in children, special yoga programs within schools are being developed for children and adolescents. This increasing popularity of the potential benefits of yoga may encourage parents to consider yoga for their children and request referrals or clarification of the purported effects. A description of the philosophical basis of yoga, the basic components of a yoga practice, safety concerns, and how to locate and evaluate a yoga program for children will be addressed.

19912493	Yoga in female sexual functions.	INTRODUCTION: Yoga is a popular form of complementary and alternative therapy. It is practiced both in developing and developed countries. Female sexual dysfunctions are common and do not always get adequate clinical attention. Pharmacotherapies for treating female sexual dysfunctions are available but suffer from drawbacks such as poor compliance, low efficacy, and side effects. Many patients and yoga protagonists claim that it is useful in improving sexual functions and treating sexual disorders. AIM: To establish the effect yoga can have on female sexual functions. METHODS: We recruited 40 females (age range 22-55 years, average age 34.7 +/- 8.49 years) who were enrolled in a yoga camp and were given a standardized questionnaire named Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) before and after the 12 weeks session of yoga. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: FSFI scores. RESULTS: It was found that after the completion of yoga sessions; the sexual functions scores were significantly improved (P < 0.0001). The improvement occurred in all six domains of FSFI (i.e., desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain). The improvement was more in older women (age > 45 years) compared with younger women (age < 45 years). CONCLUSIONS: Yoga appears to be an effective method of improving all domains of sexual functions in women as studied by FSFI.

19909695	[Effects of fitness training and yoga on well-being stress, social competence and body image].	OBJECTIVES: Aims of our study were to describe and compare influences from a physical activity program and a yoga program on well-being, mood, stresscoping, body-image and social competence in healthy people. METHODS: 18 persons attending a gym and 21 taking part in a yoga program answered following questionnaires before entering the program and after taking part for 20 units: Body-Image-Questionnaire (25), Symptom-Checklist- 90R (8), Complaint- List (31), Adjective Mood-Scale (32) and a Visual Analogue Scale for assessing stress-level (10). RESULTS: Statistical analyses show significant improvement in social competence in both training groups; the gym-group report reduced sexual discomfort, whereas people taking part in yoga-group show a reduction in somatization and body-related anxiety as well as an improvement in physical and emotional well-being. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the evidence that physical activity in general improves psychological well-being, however, gym and yoga seem to have different psychological impacts. Future research should focus on comparing the psychological effects of different physical activity interventions in prevention programmes as well as exercise prescriptions in patients with mental illness.

19909052	Exploring a cognitive-based treatment approach to improve motor-based skill performance in chronic stroke: Results of three single case experiments.	PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Early evidence suggests the use of cognitive strategies has potential to improve skill performance in people living with the effects of stroke, but no specific protocol has been identified. This study aimed to explore the potential of using the Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP) protocol to improve the functional performance of adults with chronic stroke. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A single case experimental design study with two replications was conducted. Three community-dwelling participants were recruited. Each selected three functional goals for the focus of the CO-OP intervention. Multiple video recorded data points were collected at baseline, during intervention, post-intervention and at 1-month follow-up. RESULTS: The nine goals selected varied widely, e.g. using a computer mouse, bicycling and yoga. An independent observer used the observational Performance Quality Rating Scale (PQRS) to rate performances throughout. Using the 2 SD band method to analyse the data, each participant showed significant performance improvements in at least two goals during the course of the intervention and at follow-up. Two participants had an additional goal show significant improvement at follow-up. CONCLUSION: Results provide preliminary evidence that CO-OP is associated with significant performance improvements in self-selected functional goals.

19903345	The Vital@Work Study. The systematic development of a lifestyle intervention to improve older workers' vitality and the design of a randomised controlled trial evaluating this intervention.	BACKGROUND: A major contributor of early exit from work is a decline in health with increasing age. As healthy lifestyle choices contribute to better health outcomes, an intervention aimed at an improved lifestyle is considered a potentially effective tool to keep older workers healthy and vital, and thereby to prolong labour participation. METHODS: Using the Intervention Mapping (IM) protocol, a lifestyle intervention was developed based on information obtained from 1) literature, 2) a short lifestyle questionnaire aimed at identifying the lifestyle behaviours among the target group, and 3) focusgroup (FG) interviews among 36 older workers (aged 45+ years) aimed at identifying: a) key determinants of lifestyle behaviour, b) a definition of vitality, and c) ideas about how vitality can be improved by lifestyle.The main lifestyle problems identified were: insufficient levels of physical activity and insufficient intake of fruit and vegetables. Using information from both literature and FG interviews, vitality consists of a mental and a physical component. The interviewees suggested to improve the mental component of vitality by means of relaxation exercises (e.g. yoga); physical vitality could be improved by aerobic endurance exercise and strength training.The lifestyle intervention (6 months) consists of three visits to a Personal Vitality Coach (PVC) combined with a Vitality Exercise Programme (VEP). The VEP consists of: 1) once a week a guided yoga group session aimed at relaxation exercises, 2) once a week a guided aerobic workout group session aimed at improving aerobic fitness and increasing muscle strength, and 3) older workers will be asked to perform once a week for at least 45 minutes vigorous physical activity without face-to-face instructions (e.g. fitness). Moreover, free fruit will be offered at the group sessions of the VEP. The lifestyle intervention will be evaluated in a RCT among older workers of two major academic hospitals in the Netherlands. At baseline, after 6 and 12 months, measurements (primary: lifestyle and vitality, and secondary: work-engagement and productivity) will take place. DISCUSSION: The lifestyle programme is developed specifically tailored to the needs of the older workers and which is aimed at improving their vitality. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NTR1240.

19900155	Yoga practice in diabetes improves physical and psychological outcomes.	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of yoga practice on clinical and psychological outcomes in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: In a 40-day yoga camp at the Institute of Yoga and Consciousness, ambulatory subjects with T2DM not having significant complications (n = 35) participated in a 40-day yoga camp, where yogic practices were overseen by trained yoga teachers. Clinical, biochemical, and psychological well-being were studied at baseline and at the end of the camp. RESULTS: At the end of the study, there was a reduction of body mass index (BMI) (26.514 +/- 3.355 to 25.771 +/- 3.40; P < 0.001) and anxiety (6.20 +/- 3.72 to 4.29 +/- 4.46; P < 0.05) and an improvement in total general well-being (48.6 +/- 11.13 to 52.66 +/- 52.66 +/- 12.87; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Participation of subjects with T2DM in yoga practice for 40 days resulted in reduced BMI, improved well-being, and reduced anxiety.	Kosuri, Madhu;Sridhar, Gumpeny R	2009 Dec

19891384	The effects of weight bearing yoga training on the bone resorption markers of the postmenopausal women.	This study was a preliminary report to investigate the effects of the weight bearing yoga training on both bone resorption marker and the quality of life of the postmenopausal women. The samples were recruited by the purposive sampling from the female Chulalongkorn University staff aged between 50-60 years. The subjects were divided into two groups: experimental group and control group. The baseline demographic data, the bone resorption marker (beta-CrossLaps), the bone formation marker (P1NP) and quality of Life (SF-36) data were collected. The experimental group attended the 12-week weight-bearing yoga training 3 days a week, 50 minutes a day while the control group lived their normal lives. After 12th week, the data collections were repeated in both groups. The experimental group (19 subjects, the mean age 54.320 yrs) and the control group (14 subjects, the mean age 54.430 yrs) were recruited. The mean ultrasound BMD of both heels in both groups showed no osteopenia or osteoporosis. After the 12-week training, the mean bone resorption marker (beta-CrossLaps) of the experimental group reduced from 0.464 to 0.339 ng/ml (-26.939%) whereas the control group reduced from 0.389 to 0.386 ng/ml (-0.771%). There was a significant difference (p < 0.05). The mean of the bone formation markers (PINP) in the experimental group reduced from 55.393 to 42.401 ng/ml (-23.454%) and the bone formation markers (PINP) in the control group reduced from 61.903 to 44.832 ng/ml (-27.577%). In the area of the life quality measurement of both groups, the data obtained from the medical outcomes study short-form survey (SF-36) showed that there were significant differences at 0.05 levels for the physical functioning, bodily pain, general health, and vitality. The variance of percentage change value of the experimental group increased to +25.299, +16.565, +15.309, and +21.056. The variance of percentage change value of the control group increased to +12.946, -1.221, -9.303 and +2.291. The weigh-bearing yoga training had a positive effect on bone by slowing down bone resorption which was a very essential indicator for human health because it reduced the osteoporosis risks in the postmenopausal women. Additionally, yoga training promoted better quality of life.	Phoosuwan, Manop;Kritpet, Thanomwong;Yuktanandana, Pongsak	2009 Sep
19890909	Complementary and alternative medicine use in patients presenting to a head and neck oncology clinic.	BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among patients presenting to a head and neck oncology clinic prior to a diagnosis. METHODS: The study was conducted by administering questionnaires to 102 patients after being seen in the Head and Neck Oncology clinic for their initial consultation. The questionnaire assessed the extent of CAM use, types of CAMs used, and their reasons for use. RESULTS: A total of 132 CAMs were currently being used among 56 patients. The most common CAMs in use were multivitamins (26/132) and vitamin D (21/132). Meditation and yoga were associated with the greatest perceived benefit. The majority of patients obtained their information from family and friends. Most patients were using CAMs for physical health and well-being. CONCLUSION: As CAM use among the population is widespread, it is important for clinicians to specifically address their use on initial presentation.

19877871	Impact of a short yoga intervention on medical students' health: a pilot study.	BACKGROUND: Medical students often experience significant distress early-on in undergraduate training. AIMS: We aimed to demonstrate the impact of a brief structured yoga intervention on medical students. METHOD: Fourteen first-year medical students participated in a 16-week yoga intervention pilot study. Students completed questionnaires at baseline, mid-intervention and end of the study. RESULTS: The students reported improvements in overall health, perceived stress and depressive symptoms following the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: A yoga intervention may be effective in decreasing stress and improving general well-being in medical students.	Simard, Andree-Anne;Henry, Melissa	2009 Oct
19875429	Diaphragmatic breathing reduces exercise-induced oxidative stress.	Diaphragmatic breathing is relaxing and therapeutic, reduces stress, and is a fundamental procedure of Pranayama Yoga, Zen, transcendental meditation and other meditation practices. Analysis of oxidative stress levels in people who meditate indicated that meditation correlates with lower oxidative stress levels, lower cortisol levels and higher melatonin levels. It is known that cortisol inhibits enzymes responsible for the antioxidant activity of cells and that melatonin is a strong antioxidant; therefore, in this study, we investigated the effects of diaphragmatic breathing on exercise-induced oxidative stress and the putative role of cortisol and melatonin hormones in this stress pathway. We monitored 16 athletes during an exhaustive training session. After the exercise, athletes were divided in two equivalent groups of eight subjects. Subjects of the studied group spent 1 h relaxing performing diaphragmatic breathing and concentrating on their breath in a quiet place. The other eight subjects, representing the control group, spent the same time sitting in an equivalent quite place. Results demonstrate that relaxation induced by diaphragmatic breathing increases the antioxidant defense status in athletes after exhaustive exercise. These effects correlate with the concomitant decrease in cortisol and the increase in melatonin. The consequence is a lower level of oxidative stress, which suggests that an appropriate diaphragmatic breathing could protect athletes from long-term adverse effects of free radicals.

19860172	[Reflexology--nothing in common with scientific naturopathic treatments].	A host of alternative treatment methods are sold to us as reputable science on the "supermarket of naturopathy" nowadays. "Foot zone therapy", also known as "reflexology" is one of them. Advocates of reflexology claim that certain zones of the feet are linked to internal organs; that "energy forces" run throughout the human body. According to the teachings of Ayurveda and Yoga, a network of more than 72,000 nerve tracts (energy tracts = meridians) is linked to a single, tiny point on the feet, where the energy ends. In reality, however, reflexology is an unconventional, alternative, paramedical and esoterical "outsider" method that has nothing in common with serious naturopathic treatments. Any scientific value to reflexology is to be denied. As opposed to reflexology, genuine, scientifically acknowledged naturopathic methods are not an alternative, but a supplement to modern medicine.

19853672	Traditional polypropylene and lightweight meshes in totally extraperitoneal inguinal herniorrhaphy.	BACKGROUND: Placement of a prosthetic mesh is integral to successful totally extraperitoneal (TEP) herniorrhaphy. Available meshes have supported the surgical efforts well but search for an ideal mesh continues. Post-herniorrhaphy pain is an index of patient reported outcomes (PRO). The pain is attributable to balloon dissection, cautery, sutures, tackers and prosthesis. Reducing polypropylene content of the mesh is associated with attenuated inflammatory response by the host and improved compliance and comfort. We report the difference in PROs in TEP herniorrhaphy with either heavy polypropylene (PPM) or light weight mesh (LWM) being used for the repair. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From June 2004 to December 2005, consecutive candidates for TEP herniorrhaphy were enrolled for this prospective study with an informed consent and compliance to Ethics guidelines. They were operated under general anesthesia (GA) on a day care basis using either PPM or LWM meshes as per the patient's choice. Operative and postoperative PRO were statistically analyzed by an independent doctor using the Microsoft Office Excel 2003. RESULTS: One hundred fourteen (84 PPMs and 30 LWMs) TEP herniorrhaphies were performed under GA on 57 male patients without any exclusion, on a day care basis. There was no technical difficulty, operative complications, conversion or prolonged hospital stay in either group. Patients of LWM reported better outcome in regards to pain, NSAID usage, seroma and recurrence. All patients of LWM reported an earlier return to activity. CONCLUSION: Light weight meshes result in comparatively better "patient reported outcomes" in TEP inguinal herniorrhaphy as compared to heavy polypropylene meshes.

19838801	Heart rate variability during sleep following the practice of cyclic meditation and supine rest.	Day time activities are known to influence the sleep on the following night. Cyclic meditation (CM) has recurring cycles. Previously, the low frequency (LF) power and the ratio between low frequency and high frequency (LF/HF ratio) of the heart rate variability (HRV) decreased during and after CM but not after a comparable period of supine rest (SR). In the present study, on thirty male volunteers, CM was practiced twice in the day and after this the HRV was recorded (1) while awake and (2) during 6 h of sleep (based on EEG, EMG and EGG recordings). This was similarly recorded for the night's sleep following the day time practice of SR. Participants were randomly assigned to the two sessions and all of them practiced both CM and SR on different days. During the night following day time CM practice there were the following changes; a decrease in heart rate, LF power (n.u.), LF/HF ratio, and an increase in the number of pairs of Normal to Normal RR intervals differing by more than 50 ms divided by total number of all NN intervals (pNN50) (P < 0.05, in all cases, comparing sleep following CM compared with sleep following SR). No change was seen on the night following SR. Hence yoga practice during the day appears to shift sympatho-vagal balance in favor of parasympathetic dominance during sleep on the following night.

19834312	[Nonpharmacological correction of low back pain by single or integrated means of medical rehabilitation and the evaluation of their effectiveness].	UNLABELLED: Low back pain is a global worldwide problem. A great attention is given to correction of this health status by a wide range of rehabilitation specialists. Some single or integrated physical factors, physiotherapy, specific and nonspecific physical exercises, alternative methods of treatment, also the complex of multidisciplinary rehabilitation means are applied in the management of low back pain. The evidence-based data are analyzed in order to identify which nonpharmacological means are effective in pain correction; in addition, the effectiveness of various methods and models of low back pain management are compared in this article. CONCLUSIONS: Research data evaluating the impact effectiveness of single or integrated means of rehabilitation are very controversial. There are no evidence-based specific recommendations for the correction of this health status objectively assessing advantages of physiotherapy or physical factors and referring the definite indications of their prescription. It is thought that multidisciplinary rehabilitation is most effective in management of chronic low back pain. The positive results depend on the experience of a physician and other rehabilitation specialists. A patient's motivation to participate in the process of pain control is very important. It is recommended to inform a patient about the effectiveness of administered methods. There is a lack of evidence-based trials evaluating the effectiveness of nonpharmacological methods of pain control in Lithuania. Therefore, the greater attention of researchers and administrative structures of health care should be given to this problem in order to develop the evidence-based guidelines for an effective correction of low back pain.

19815593	Integrative Tumor Board: a case report and discussion from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.	A 34-year-old woman carrying a BRCA1 gene and a significant family history was diagnosed with T1c, N1 breast cancer. The tumor was estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER-2/Neu negative. The patient received dose-dense chemotherapy with Adriamycin and Cytoxan followed by Taxol, and left breast irradiation. Later, a bilateral S-GAP flap reconstruction with right prophylactic mastectomy and left mastectomy were performed. During her treatment, the patient had an integrative medicine consultation and was seen by a team of health care providers specializing in integrative therapies, including integrative nutrition, therapeutic massage, acupuncture, and yoga. Each modality contributed unique benefit in her care that led to a satisfactory outcome for the patient. A detailed discussion regarding her care from each modality is presented. The case elucidates the need for integrative approaches for cancer patients in a conventional medical setting.

19810584	Effect of yoga-nidra on blood glucose level in diabetic patients.	Diabetes is a metabolic disorder, which has become a major health challenge worldwide. South East Asian countries have a highest burden of diabetes. In India the prevalence of diabetes is rising rapidly especially in the urban population because of increasing obesity and reduced physical activity. An objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of Yoga-Nidra on blood glucose level in diabetic patients. This study was conducted on 41, middle aged, type-2 diabetic patients, who were on oral hypoglycaemic. These patients were divided in to two groups: (a) 20 patients on oral hypoglycaemic with yoga-nidra, and (b) 21 were on oral hypoglycaemic alone. Yoga-nidra practiced for 30 minutes daily up to 90 days, parameters were recorded every. 30th day. Results of this study showed that most of the symptoms were subsided (P < 0.004, significant), and fall of mean blood glucose level was significant after 3-month of Yoga-nidra. This fall was 21.3 mg/dl, P < 0.0007, (from 159 +/- 12.27 to 137.7 +/- 23.15,) in fasting and 17.95 mg/dl, P = 0.02, (from 255.45 +/- 16.85 to 237.5 +/- 30.54) in post prandial glucose level. Results of this study suggest that subjects on Yoga-nidra with drug regimen had better control in their fluctuating blood glucose and symptoms associated with diabetes, compared to those were on oral hypoglycaemics alone.

19810579	Immediate effects of two relaxation techniques on healthy volunteers.	This controlled study compared immediate effects of two relaxation techniques on state anxiety and sustained attention in healthy subjects. 86 volunteers (56 men and 30 women) were divided into two groups: the first 43 volunteers (age range 18 to 64) practiced 20 minutes of yoga-based Deep Relaxation Technique (DRT), while the second group of 43 volunteers (same age range), practiced 20 minutes Supine Rest (SR). State anxiety was assessed using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI A-State), and sustained attention was assessed using the Six Letter Cancellation (SLC) and Digit Letter Substitution (DLS) tests. All tests were administered immediately before, and immediately after, practice. A significant reduction in State Anxiety score (P < 0.001) was observed for the group practicing DRT, but not for the group practicing SR. For the sustained attention tests, however, there were significant increases in scores by both DRT and SR groups (P < 0.001). The results suggest that both interventions improve attention, but that only DRT reduces State Anxiety.	Khemka, Sushilkumar S;Rao, Nagendra H Rama;Nagarathna, Raghuram	2009 Jan-Mar
19810571	Yogic exercises and health--a psycho-neuro immunological approach.	Relaxation potential of yogic exercises seems to play a vital role in establishing psycho-physical health in reversing the psycho-immunology of emotions under stress based on breath and body awareness. However, mechanism of yogic exercises for restoring health and fitness components operating through psycho-neuro-immunological pathways is unknown. Therefore, a hybrid model of human information processing-psycho-neuroendocrine (HIP-PNE) network has been proposed to reveal the importance of yogic information processing. This study focuses on two major pathways of information processing involving cortical and hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) interactions with a deep reach molecular action on cellular, neuro-humoral and immune system in reversing stress mediated diseases. Further, the proposed HIP-PNE model has ample of experimental potential for objective evaluation of yogic view of health and fitness.	Kulkarni, D D;Bera, T K	2009 Jan-Mar
19776221	Stress reduction correlates with structural changes in the amygdala.	Stress has significant adverse effects on health and is a risk factor for many illnesses. Neurobiological studies have implicated the amygdala as a brain structure crucial in stress responses. Whereas hyperactive amygdala function is often observed during stress conditions, cross-sectional reports of differences in gray matter structure have been less consistent. We conducted a longitudinal MRI study to investigate the relationship between changes in perceived stress with changes in amygdala gray matter density following a stress-reduction intervention. Stressed but otherwise healthy individuals (N = 26) participated in an 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention. Perceived stress was rated on the perceived stress scale (PSS) and anatomical MR images were acquired pre- and post-intervention. PSS change was used as the predictive regressor for changes in gray matter density within the bilateral amygdalae. Following the intervention, participants reported significantly reduced perceived stress. Reductions in perceived stress correlated positively with decreases in right basolateral amygdala gray matter density. Whereas prior studies found gray matter modifications resulting from acquisition of abstract information, motor and language skills, this study demonstrates that neuroplastic changes are associated with improvements in a psychological state variable.

19773673	Cerebral blood flow changes during chanting meditation.	PURPOSE: To examine changes in brain physiology during a chanting meditation practice using cerebral blood flow single-photon emission computed tomography. METHODS: Single-photon emission computed tomography scans were acquired in 11 healthy individuals during either a resting state or meditation practice randomly performed on two separate days. Statistical parametric mapping analyses were conducted to identify significant changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) between the two conditions. RESULTS: When the meditation state was compared with the baseline condition, significant rCBF increases were observed in the right temporal lobe and posterior cingulate gyrus, and significant rCBF decreases were observed in the left parietotemporal and occipital gyri. CONCLUSION: The results offer evidence that this form of meditation practice is associated with changes in brain function in a way that is consistent with earlier studies of related types of meditation as well as with the positive clinical outcomes anecdotally reported by its users.

19771929	Effects of yoga on inner-city children's well-being: a pilot study.	OBJECTIVE: To examine yoga's effects on inner-city children's well-being. METHODS: This pilot study compared fourth- and fifth-grade students at 2 after-school programs in Bronx, New York. One program offered yoga 1 hour per week for 12 weeks (yoga) and the other program (non-yoga) did not. Preintervention and postintervention emotional well-being was assessed by Harter's Global Self-Worth and Physical Appearance subscales, which were the study's primary outcome measures. Secondary outcomes included other measures of emotional well-being assessed by 2 new scales: Perceptions of Physical Health and Yoga Teachings (including Negative Behaviors, Positive Behaviors, and Focusing/relaxation subscales). Preintervention and postintervention, physical wellbeing was assessed by measures of flexibility and balance. Subjective ratings ofyoga's effects on well-being were evaluated by an additional questionnaire completed by the yoga group only. RESULTS: Data were collected from 78% (n=39) and 86.5% (n=32) of potential yoga and non-yoga study enrollees. No differences in baseline demographics were found. Controlling for preintervention well-being differences using analysis of covariance, we found that children in the yoga group had better postintervention Negative Behaviors scores and balance than the non-yoga group (P < .05). The majority of children participating in yoga reported enhanced wellbeing, as reflected by perceived improvements in behaviors directly targeted by yoga (e.g., strength, flexibility, balance). CONCLUSIONS: Although no significant differences were found in the study's primary outcomes (global self-worth and perceptions of physical well-being), children participating in yoga reported using fewer negative behaviors in response to stress and had better balance than a comparison group. Improvements in wellbeing, specifically in behaviors directly targeted by yoga, were reported. These results suggest a possible role of yoga as a preventive intervention as well as a means of improving children's perceived well-being.

19770523	Risk of posttraumatic stress disorder and depression in survivors of the floods in Bihar, India.	BACKGROUND: Following a natural disaster, survivors are vulnerable to develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/ or depression. OBJECTIVES: (i) To screen survivors of the Bihar floods a month after the event to determine their scores in a screening questionnaire for PTSD and/ or depression and (ii) to correlate these scores with age and gender. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One thousand two hundred eighty-nine persons (645 females) who had been directly exposed to the floods in Bihar, India, in August 2008 were assessed. The Screening Questionnaire for Disaster Mental Health (SQD) was used to screen for PTSD and depression. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Separate two-factor ANOVAs were used to compare persons of both sexes and 5 different age groups for PTSD and depression scores. This was followed by post-hoc analysis for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: People over the age of 60 years had significantly higher scores for PTSD and depression compared to all groups (P< 0.05 for all comparisons). CONCLUSION: Following a natural disaster, older people appear more vulnerable to develop PTSD and depression. This should be taken into account in devising strategies for disaster relief.

19769471	Cerebral blood flow effects of yoga training: preliminary evaluation of 4 cases.	OBJECTIVES: Experienced practitioners of yoga have been shown to alter brain function, but this case series measured cerebral blood flow before and after a 12-week training program in Iyengar yoga (IY) for naive subjects. METHODS: On the first day, each of the 4 subjects listened to the teacher speaking on the history and background of the yoga program while they were injected with 250 MBq of (99m)Tc-bicisate and received a single photon emission computed tomography scan (pre-program baseline). Subjects then had their first IY training and were injected and scanned with 925 MBq bicisate while they did their first meditation (pre-program meditation). Subjects then underwent a 12-week training program in IY and then underwent the same imaging protocol with a postprogram baseline and postprogram meditation scan. Baseline and meditation scans, before and after training, were compared using paired t tests. RESULTS: There were significant decreases (p < 0.05) between the pre- and postprogram baseline scans in the right amygdala, dorsal medial cortex, and sensorimotor area. There was a significant difference (p < 0.05) in the pre- and postprogram percentage change (i.e., activation) in the right dorsal medial frontal lobe, prefrontal cortex, and right sensorimotor cortex. CONCLUSIONS: These initial findings suggest the brain experiences a "training effect" after 12 weeks of IY training.

The self-rated musculoskeletal discomfort, hand grip strength, tapping speed, and low back and hamstring flexibility (based on a sit and reach task) were assessed in 291 professional computer users. They were then randomized as Yoga (YG; n=146) and Wait-list control (WL; n=145) groups. Follow-up assessments for both groups were after 60 days during which the YG group practiced yoga for 60 minutes daily, for 5 days in a week. The WL group spent the same time in their usual recreational activities. At the end of 60 days, the YG group (n=62) showed a significant decrease in the frequency, intensity and degree of interference due to musculoskeletal discomfort, an increase in bilateral hand grip strength, the right hand tapping speed, and low back and hamstring flexibility (repeated measures ANOVA and post hoc analysis with Bonferroni adjustment). In contrast, the WL group (n=56) showed an increase in musculoskeletal discomfort and a decrease in left hand tapping speed. The results suggest that yoga practice is a useful addition to the routine of professional computer users.	Telles, Shirley;Dash, Manoj;Naveen, K V	2009

19757974	T'ai chi and qigong for health: patterns of use in the United States.	BACKGROUND: Little is known in the United States about those who practice t'ai chi and qigong, two mind-body techniques that originated in Asia. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to characterize use of t'ai chi and qigong for health with regard to sociodemographics, health status, medical conditions, perceptions of helpfulness, and disclosure of use to medical professionals. METHODS: We analyzed associations of t'ai chi and qigong use for health using cross-sectional data from the 2002 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Alternative Medicine Supplement (n = 31,044). The 2002 NHIS estimated the number of t'ai chi and qigong users for health to be 2.5 and 0.5 million persons, respectively. We collapsed t'ai chi and qigong use into a single category (TCQ) for analysis, representing 2.8 million individuals. RESULTS: We found that neither age nor sex was associated with TCQ use. TCQ users were more likely than nonusers to be Asian than white (odds ratio [OR] 2.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.30-3.15), college educated (OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.97-3.03), and less likely to live in the Midwest (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.42-0.96) or the southern United States (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.36-0.72) than the West. TCQ use was associated independently with higher reports of musculoskeletal conditions (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.11-1.83), severe sprains (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.14-2.40), and asthma (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.08-2.10). Half of TCQ users also used yoga for health in the last 12 months. Most TCQ users reported their practice to be important to maintain health, but only a quarter of users disclosed their practice to a medical professional. CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, TCQ is practiced for health by a diverse population, and users report benefits for maintaining health. Further research is needed to establish efficacy and safety for target populations, including those with musculoskeletal and pulmonary disease, as well as for preventive health.

19740219	Complementary and alternative methods in cerebral palsy.	There are no published studies specifically addressing complementary and alternative treatments in adults with cerebral palsy (CP). However, national surveys of adults with chronic disabilities document that a majority of them use such treatments, that they are willing to pay out of pocket, if necessary, and that they believe that pursuing such treatment relieves pain, reduces stress and anxiety, and leads to improved feelings of fitness and well-being. Individuals enjoy taking charge of their own health care decisions, and frequently feel more in control with these therapies than with more traditional methods. In contrast to adults, there is some information on complementary and alternative methods (CAM) in children with CP. This article discusses some of the CAM used in children that may be carried over into adulthood, as well as the pitfalls for patients and conventional physicians as they try to sort out what might be helpful and what might be harmful in this arena. Practitioners of both conventional and CAM therapies believe that exercise can be beneficial; accordingly, activities such as recreational sports, yoga, and hippotherapy may be continued from childhood into adulthood. General treatments for stress and anxiety, through such activities as yoga and meditation, though not directed at CP per se, may be more popular for adults than children. Research in this area should first identify what methods are being utilized and then subject these methods to well-designed outcome studies that take into account any associated risks.

19756398	Yoga and qigong in the psychological prevention of mental health disorders: a conceptual synthesis.	The study proposes to explore two alternative medicine therapies-qigong and yoga for balancing the essential duo of holistic mind-body and consequently offer a solution for stress, uncertainty, anxiety and depression. Qualitative research methods have been used to create a conceptual synthesis of yoga and qigong. It is suggested that an increased sense of control is the interface between these two modalities. This conceptual congruence of qigong and yoga is thought to be a selective, curative method, a prescription for ideal living and a ground of human essence existence. Furthermore, this essence is thought to enhance the mind's self-regulatory processes and prevent mental health disorders. The two alternative therapies can prevent mental health disorders such as anxiety, depression and, minimize mental health disruptions such as stress and poor quality of life. It is suggested that patients and/or clients can benefit from this fusion.	Posadzki, Paul;Parekh, Sheetal;Glass, Nel	2010 Feb
19755095	Use of alternative medicine in Israeli chronic rhinosinusitis patients.	OBJECTIVE: The worldwide interest in the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has been established in multiple surveys. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is often an unremitting disease with frequent troubling relapses, and despite wide use of endoscopic sinus surgery, conventional medicine may have a smaller contribution than expected. Because of prevalent use of CAM among patients, it is important that physicians acquire basic knowledge of this subject. We studied the prevalence of CAM use among CRS patients in Israel. DESIGN: Use of CAM was evaluated in a cohort of consecutive adult patients with CRS. SETTING: An outpatient clinic in a tertiary medical centre. METHODS: Patients were asked to fill out an anonymous questionnaire containing demographic data and data pertaining to allergy, traditional medical and surgical treatment use of CAM, and modalities used. RESULTS: Ninety patients were included. Nineteen of them (21%) reported CAM use. This included herbal medicine, vitamins, homeopathy, acupuncture, massage, reflexology, yoga, and chiropractics. There was a tendency, although not statistically significant, for patients with allergy and a history of sinus surgery to use CAM. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CAM use among patients with CRS in Israel is high and may correlate with the presence of allergies and a history of sinus surgery.

19751539	A pilot study measuring the impact of yoga on the trait of mindfulness.	BACKGROUND: The current study examined whether yoga would increase levels of mindfulness in a healthy population. METHOD: Forty-six participants were randomly assigned to an 8-week yoga intervention group or a wait-list control group. Mindfulness was assessed pre and post yoga, using the Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory (FMI). RESULTS: Results indicate that the yoga group experienced a significant increase in Overall mindfulness, and in three mindfulness subscales; Attention to the present moment, Accepting and open attitudes toward experience, and Insightful understanding (p < .01). The control group experienced a significant increase in overall mindfulness (p < .02) and insightful understanding (p < .01). Findings suggest that a yoga intervention may be a viable method for increasing levels of trait mindfulness in a healthy population, potentially implicating yoga as a preventive method for the later development of negative emotional mood states (i.e. anxiety and depression). The control group also experienced moderate elevations of mindfulness at the second assessment.	Shelov, Danielle V;Suchday, Sonia;Friedberg, Jennifer P	2009 Oct
19746314	Optimal sensor positioning to track rib deflections from an optical system in the Hybrid III dummy.	OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to determine the optimal use of a new optical device, the RibEye system, intended to obtain internal ribcage deflections from tests using anthropomorphic test dummies. Specifically, the study was designed to determine the most efficacious mounting location of light emitting diodes (LEDs) on the ribs and sternum in the 50th percentile male Hybrid III dummy. METHODS: Optical signal drop-out and accuracy assessment tests were conducted. In the former series, symmetric antero-posterior chest compressive loading was accomplished using cylindrical and square indenters, and asymmetrical compressive loading was accomplished using unilateral offset and diagonal belt-type loadings. LEDs were mounted to multiple ribs bilaterally at varying locations on the ribcage. The internal chest potentiometer available in the Hybrid III dummy was used. The latter series, aimed at examining the system accuracy, consisted of tests with LEDs mounted to the 4 corners of the sternum, termed sternum-mounted LED tests; rib-mounted tests wherein LEDs were mounted either to a specific rib or in the intercostal space of two successive ribs; rib-mounted tests with rotated chest simulating oblique loading; and indenter-mounted isolated LED tests. An electro-hydraulic testing device was used to apply compressive loads via an indenter in all tests. Displacement profiles were extracted from the optical system records, drop-out evaluations were conducted, and the system accuracy was evaluated by comparing data from the indenter and/or internal chest potentiometer. RESULTS: In general, results indicated that the RibEye system captures rib cage deformations effectively. Under symmetric loading, LEDs on the sternum responded similar to the internal chest potentiometer. The accuracy of the system depended on the location of position of the LEDs on the rib, magnitude of rib deformation, and potential interference from internal dummy structures such as the presence of the internal chest potentiometer. Optimum locations for LED placement were found to be at a distance of 9 cm, measured along the outer curvilinear path of the rib from the mid-sternum on either side. At this location, the system showed no signal drop-out at deflections representative of the United States current frontal impact Injury Assessment Reference Values. Signal drop-out was also depended on the type of loading: diagonal belt-type loading produced more signal loss. Mounting LEDs away from the center of the rib representing eccentric superior-inferior (z) axis placement also resulted in loss of accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: These controlled evaluations provide a fundamental understanding of the performance of the system as installed in the 50th percentile male Hybrid III dummy and its ability to measure both antero-posterior and lateral components of deflections at multiple ribs, including the sternum for frontal impact applications. The system may be optimally used to gather rib deflection data without signal drop-out under symmetrical and asymmetrical loadings when LEDs are mounted on the superior-inferior centerline of the ribs with no eccentricity along the z-axis and at the 9-cm location from the mid-sternum on either side of the ribcage and at any corner on the sternum to obtain sternum deflections.

19746313	Importance of physical properties of the human head on head-neck injury metrics.	OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate the importance of using specimen-specific head physical properties in head-neck dynamics. METHODS: Eight postmortem human subjects were subjected to side impact. A 9-axis accelerometer package was used to obtain head translational accelerations. After test, the head was isolated at the skull base, circumference, breadth, and length were obtained, and mass, center of gravity, and occipital condylar locations and moments of inertia were determined. Using specimen-specific and gathered accelerations, 3-dimensional head center of gravity accelerations and forces and moments at the occipital condyles were computed. Head physical properties were also extracted from regression equations using external dimensions of each subject. Using these properties and gathered kinematics, above-described accelerations and forces and moments were computed and compared with specimen-specific results. RESULTS: Head masses predicted by stature and total body mass were more in close agreement with specimen-specific data than head masses predicted by head circumference or head circumference and head length. The center of gravity to the occipital condyle vector was shorter in the literature-based dataset than the actual specimen-specific vector. Differences in moments of inertias between predicted and specimen-specific data ranged from -15 to 59 percent. Variations in peak antero-posterior shear, lateral shear, and axial force ranged from -12 to 46 percent, -21 to 78 percent, and -17 to 50 percent. Differences in peak lateral moment, sagittal moment, and axial torque ranged from -45 to 78 percent, -86 to 327 percent, and -96 to 112 percent. These were normalized using specimen-specific data. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable variations in physical properties and injury metrics between data obtained from literature-based regression equations and actual data for each specimen suggest the critical importance of specimen-specific data to accurately describe the biodynamic response and establish tolerance criteria. Because neck dynamics control head kinematics (and vice versa), these results emphasize the need to determine physical properties of each specimen following impact tests.

19743553	"Subtle" psychosomatic aspects of Tibetan medicine.	The theory and practice of traditional Tibetan medicine (TTM) is based on an understanding of a tri-level psycho-physical system; this bi-directional connection between the psycho-somatic realms is mediated by a distinct, yet inseparable energetic system--the subtle body. TTM practitioners approach both diagnosis and treatment from an understanding of this subtle energetic system. In the Tibetan yogic tradition, control of this system via advanced yogic and meditative technologies is the path to realize extraordinary levels of health, happiness, and longevity. As a result, understanding this intricately linked philosophical, medical, and yogic system is critical for engaging in dialogue about longevity-enhancement within this tradition.

19735248	Protection throughout the life span: the psychoneuroimmunologic impact of Indo-Tibetan meditative and yogic practices.	The Indo-Tibetan tradition claims that proficiency in the suggested longevity practices of meditation, diet, and physical exercise (yoga), will result in profound anti-aging, stress-mediating and health enhancing effects. Western biomedical research has begun to demonstrate that the psychobiological states induced and cultivated by cognitive behavioral practices which are emblematic of those contained within the Indo-Tibetan tradition (hypnosis, meditation, visualization, systematic relaxation), indeed do have a profound impact on the body's protective and regulatory systems. Although continued study is necessary, much of the early research illuminating the mechanisms responsible for the life-span extending and health-enhancing effects of these cognitive behavioral practices points to the importance of their anti-inflammatory, anti-stress, and antioxidant effects as well as their impact in enhancing the production of endogenous substances that possess general longevity-enhancing, regenerative properties.

19735243	Current concepts in limb regeneration: a hand surgeon's perspective.	Cognitive-behavioral practices such as meditation and yoga have long been viewed as methods of reaching states of peace and relaxation, but recent research has focused on the role of these practices in reducing endogenous mediators of stress and inflammation that would otherwise be harmful to our bodies. Further, these stress-related factors play major roles in inflammation, acting as barriers to wound healing and tissue regeneration. Fractures, denervation, tendon and ligament rupture, and cartilage degradation are morbidities associated with injury and often act as an impediment for healing. Studies of human fingertip regeneration exist; however, the underlying molecular and environmental changes have yet to be completely elucidated. Studying the regenerative capabilities of lower organisms and fetal wound healing has allowed scientists to understand the mechanisms behind regeneration, coming closer to a human application. Much research relies on the idea that the developing embryo shares a great deal in common with regenerating appendages of organisms such as the salamander. This review will cover historical perspectives of regeneration biology and current topics in limb regeneration, with particular interest given to the upper extremity, including the commonalities between human embryological development and amphibian regeneration, growth factors and pathways that show correlation with development and regeneration, recently discovered differences in fetal and adult wound healing, and current research and knowledge regarding human extremity tissue regeneration. With a greater understanding of the mechanisms and mediators involved in regeneration, the application of cognitive-behavioral practices may assist in seeing the future goals of regeneration come to fruition.

19735239	Yoga breathing, meditation, and longevity.	Yoga breathing is an important part of health and spiritual practices in Indo-Tibetan traditions. Considered fundamental for the development of physical well-being, meditation, awareness, and enlightenment, it is both a form of meditation in itself and a preparation for deep meditation. Yoga breathing (pranayama) can rapidly bring the mind to the present moment and reduce stress. In this paper, we review data indicating how breath work can affect longevity mechanisms in some ways that overlap with meditation and in other ways that are different from, but that synergistically enhance, the effects of meditation. We also provide clinical evidence for the use of yoga breathing in the treatment of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and for victims of mass disasters. By inducing stress resilience, breath work enables us to rapidly and compassionately relieve many forms of suffering.	Brown, Richard P;Gerbarg, Patricia L	2009 Aug
19735236	Longevity: potential life span and health span enhancement through practice of the basic yoga meditation regimen.	This chapter briefly reviews recent psychological, physiological, molecular biological, and anthropological research which has important implications, both direct and indirect, for the recognition and understanding of the potential life span and health span enhancing effects of the basic yoga meditational regimen. This regimen consists of meditation, yogic breath control practices, physical exercises (of both a postural- and movement-based, including aerobic nature), and dietary practices. While each of these component categories exhibit variations in different schools, lineages, traditions, and cultures, the focus of this chapter is primarily on basic forms of relaxation meditation and breath control, as well as postural and aerobic physical exercises (e.g., yogic prostration regimens, see below), and a standard form of yogic or ascetic diet, all of which constitute a basic form of regimen found in many if not most cultures, though with variations.

19735235	Toward a unified field of study: longevity, regeneration, and protection of health through meditation and related practices.	The orientation of this volume and the Longevity and Optimal Health: Integrating Eastern and Western Perspectives conference is that there is abundant evidence in the scientific and medical literatures that the diligent practice of certain yoga-meditational regimens can lead to a spectrum of health enhancements, ranging from modest to profound, and that these can be investigated in a scientifically rigorous fashion. This overview will summarize these possibilities regarding improved human longevity, regeneration, and protection of health and serve to introduce the perspectives of conference participants from all of the traditions represented.

19734256	Iyengar Yoga versus Enhanced Usual Care on Blood Pressure in Patients with Prehypertension to Stage I Hypertension: a Randomized Controlled Trial.	The prevalence of prehypertension and Stage 1 hypertension continues to increase despite being amenable to non-pharmacologic interventions. Iyengar yoga (IY) has been purported to reduce blood pressure (BP) though evidence from randomized trials is lacking. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of 12 weeks of IY versus enhanced usual care (EUC) (based on individual dietary adjustment) on 24-h ambulatory BP in yoga-naive adults with untreated prehypertension or Stage 1 hypertension. In total, 26 and 31 subjects in the IY and EUC arms, respectively, completed the study. There were no differences in BP between the groups at 6 and 12 weeks. In the EUC group, 24-h systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) significantly decreased by 5, 3 and 3 mmHg, respectively, from baseline at 6 weeks (P < .05), but were no longer significant at 12 weeks. In the IY group, 24 h SBP was reduced by 6 mmHg at 12 weeks compared to baseline (P = .05). 24 h DBP (P < .01) and MAP (P < .05) decreased significantly each by 5 mmHg. No differences were observed in catecholamine or cortisol metabolism to explain the decrease in BP in the IY group at 12 weeks. Twelve weeks of IY produces clinically meaningful improvements in 24 h SBP and DBP. Larger studies are needed to establish the long term efficacy, acceptability, utility and potential mechanisms of IY to control BP.

19725313	Effect of four voluntary regulated yoga breathing techniques on grip strength.	Bilateral hand-grip strength was studied in 21 male volunteers (M age = 25.6 yr., SD = 5.2). All were assessed before and after five practice sessions of 20 min. duration: right-nostril yoga breathing, left-nostril yoga breathing, alternate-nostril yoga breathing, breath awareness, and a no-intervention session. Data were analyzed with analyses of variance and an analysis of variance using the no-breath awareness control condition as a covariate. There were no significant changes. The left-hand-grip strength reduced after left-nostril yoga breathing. However, findings were not considered significant, so methodological issues in yoga research which could contribute to null findings and even mask actual changes were discussed.

19715397	The efficacy of mindfulness-based meditation therapy on anxiety, depression, and spirituality in Japanese patients with cancer.	OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of the study was to assess the efficacy of mindfulness-based meditation therapy on anxiety, depression, and spiritual well-being of Japanese patients undergoing anticancer treatment. A secondary goal was to assess the relationships among anxiety, depression, spiritual well-being, growth, appreciation, pain, and symptoms. METHODS: The subjects were 28 patients who were receiving anticancer treatment. The subjects participated in two sessions of mindfulness-based meditation therapy, including breathing, yoga movement and meditation. Each patient was taught the program in the first session, then exercised at home with a CD, and subsequently met the interviewer in a second session after 2 weeks. Primary physicians recruited the patients and interviews were conducted individually by nurses or psychologists with training in the program. Patients completed preintervention and postintervention questionnaires on anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]), spiritual well-being (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual [FACIT-Sp]), and appreciation, growth, pain, and symptoms. RESULTS: HADS scores significantly decreased from 12 +/- 5.3 to 8.6 +/- 6.3 (p = 0.004) after the intervention, and FACIT-Sp increased from 32 +/- 6.5 to 33 +/- 6.9 (p = 0.69), but the change was not significant. There were significant associations between FACIT-Sp and HADS (r = -0.78, p = 000), FACIT-Sp and growth (r = -0.35, p = 0.04), FACIT-Sp and pain (r = -0.41, p = 0.02), and growth and appreciation (r = 0.45, p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness-based meditation therapy may be effective for anxiety and depression in Japanese cancer patients, and spiritual well-being is related to anxiety and depression, growth, and pain. The negative correlation of spirituality with growth differs from the results of previous studies and the mechanism of this effect needs to be investigated further.

19715182	Changes in midlatency auditory evoked potentials following two yoga-based relaxation techniques.	Practicing meditation while focusing on a sound or a symbol influenced midlatency auditory evoked potentials (MLAEPs). Cyclic meditation (CM) is a technique combining yoga postures with meditation while supine, which has influenced the P300 event-related potential. The effects of CM on MLAEPs have not been previously studied. The MLAEPs were studied before and after the practice of CM compared to an equal duration of supine rest (SR) in 47 male volunteers (group mean age 26.5 +/- 4.4 years), recorded from the vertex referenced to linked earlobes. The sessions were one day apart and subjects were randomly assigned to each session. The Pa wave peak latency and Nb wave peak latency significantly increased following CM compared to before CM (repeated measures ANOVA, post-hoc analysis with least significant difference, p<0.05). There was a significant increase in the peak amplitude of the Nb wave (p<0.05) compared to before CM. Post SR there was a significant increase in the peak latency of the Na wave (p<0.05) compared to before SR. In conclusion following CM the latencies of neural generators corresponding to cortical areas is prolonged, whereas following SR a similar change occurs at mesencephalic-diencephalic levels.

19711772	The role of alternative and complementary treatments of asthma.	Asthma is one of the leading chronic diseases of our times, with millions of sufferers worldwide and can be defined as a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that is temporarily reversible either spontaneously or by treatment. Although there are many allopathic treatments including bronchodilators and corticosteroids, which either focuses on long-term control or immediate relief, there is no single medication that is effective against both the inflammatory and bronchoconstrictive components of asthma. Therefore, many sufferers turn to alternative or complementary therapies, typically in conjunction with their regular allopathic medications. The current short communication briefly reviews the disease and investigates the types of alternative and complementary treatments available to asthma sufferers. It is concluded that therapies like acupuncture, yoga, Tai Chi Chuan and hypnosis are used by many asthma patients but it seems as if many patients do not communicate the use of such therapies to their medical practitioners. Results from documented research, however, show alternative therapies for the treatment of asthma have a role to play and are effective to alleviate symptoms. However, well-organized clinical trials are needed to document efficacy and delineate the specific types of interventions most appropriate for particular asthmatic populations.

19707092	Dilemmas, tetralemmas, reimagining the electronic health record.	With the transition from paper-based to computer-based records, nursing practice shifts to computerized documentation of care in the electronic health record (EHR). Viewed not only as an electronic document, but as an instrument of modern economic and technological ideology that serves organizational goals of cost-efficiency, the EHR can be perceived as creating a dilemma for a patient-centered nursing practice. Viewing the EHR as relying solely on the use of standardized languages begets a number of questions and furthers the dilemma for nurses. Through a discussion that draws on the Indian tradition of the tetralemma, authors transcend the EHR/nursing dilemma.	Petrovskaya, Olga;McIntyre, Marjorie;McDonald, Carol	2009 Jul-Sep
19705417	Mind-body complementary alternative medicine use and quality of life in adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease.	BACKGROUND: Mind-body complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) modalities (e.g., relaxation or meditation) for symptom management have not been well studied in adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The purposes of this study were to: 1) determine the prevalence of 5 types of mind-body CAM use, and consideration of use for symptom management; 2) assess characteristics associated with regular mind-body CAM use; and 3) examine whether regular and/or considered mind-body CAM use are associated with health-related quality of life (HRQOL). METHODS: Sixty-seven adolescents with IBD ages 12-19 recruited from a children's hospital completed a questionnaire on CAM use and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory. Logistic regression models were estimated for regular and considered CAM use. RESULTS: Participants mean (SD) age was 15.5 (2.1) years; 37 (55%) were female; 53 (79%) were white; and 20 (30%) had moderate disease severity. Adolescents used prayer (62%), relaxation (40%), and imagery (21%) once/day to once/week for symptom management. In multivariate analyses, females were more likely to use relaxation (odds ratio [OR] = 4.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.25-15.29, c statistic = 0.73). Younger adolescents were more likely to regularly use (OR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.42-0.95, c statistic = 0.72) or consider using (OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.59-1.00, c statistic = 0.64) meditation. Adolescents with more severe disease (OR = 4.17, 95% CI = 1.07-16.29, c statistic = 0.83) were more willing to consider using relaxation in the future. Adolescents with worse HRQOL were more willing to consider using prayer and meditation for future symptom management (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Many adolescents with IBD either currently use or would consider using mind-body CAM for symptom management.

19705358	Complementary and alternative medicine use in Gilles de la Tourette syndrome.	The aim of this study was to describe the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in patients with Tourette syndrome (TS) and explore associations with CAM use. In recent years CAM use has increased, but rates of CAM use in TS patients are not reported. Consecutive TS patients or their parent(s), seen in an academic movement disorder center, completed a questionnaire regarding their use of CAM. One hundred TS patients or parents completed the questionnaire, mean age 21.5 +/- 13.5, 76 males, 87 Caucasians. Sixty four patients had used at least one CAM modality. CAM treatments used were prayer (28), vitamins (21), massage (19), dietary supplements (15), chiropractic manipulations (12), meditation (10), diet alterations (nine), yoga (nine), acupuncture (eight), hypnosis (seven), homeopathy (six), and EEG biofeedback (six). Fifty six percent of patients using CAM reported some improvement. Users paid out of pocket for 47% of treatments pursued, and 19% of these payers received partial reimbursement by third party payer. Users and non-users did not differ in age, gender, race, income, educational level, general health, tic severity, medication use for TS, current satisfaction from medications or experience of side effects from medications. CAM use was associated with the presence of affective disorder (P = 0.004), but not with either ADHD or OCD. Among CAM users, 80% initiated CAM without informing their doctor. CAM is commonly used in children and adults with TS, and often without the neurologist's knowledge. Physicians should inquire about CAM to understand the spectrum of interventions that patients with TS use.	Kompoliti, Katie;Fan, Wenqin;Leurgans, Sue	2009 Oct 15
19701112	Evaluation of the effectiveness and efficacy of Iyengar yoga therapy on chronic low back pain.	STUDY DESIGN: The effectiveness and efficacy of Iyengar yoga for chronic low back pain (CLBP) were assessed with intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis. Ninety subjects were randomized to a yoga (n = 43) or control group (n = 47) receiving standard medical care. Participants were followed 6 months after completion of the intervention. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate Iyengar yoga therapy on chronic low back pain. Yoga subjects were hypothesized to report greater reductions in functional disability, pain intensity, depression, and pain medication usage than controls. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: CLBP is a musculoskeletal disorder with public health and economic impact. Pilot studies of yoga and back pain have reported significant changes in clinically important outcomes. METHODS: Subjects were recruited through self-referral and health professional referrals according to explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria. Yoga subjects participated in 24 weeks of biweekly yoga classes designed for CLBP. Outcomes were assessed at 12 (midway), 24 (immediately after), and 48 weeks (6-month follow-up) after the start of the intervention using the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, a Visual Analog Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, and a pain medication-usage questionnaire. RESULTS: Using intention-to-treat analysis with repeated measures ANOVA (group x time), significantly greater reductions in functional disability and pain intensity were observed in the yoga group when compared to the control group at 24 weeks. A significantly greater proportion of yoga subjects also reported clinical improvements at both 12 and 24 weeks. In addition, depression was significantly lower in yoga subjects. Furthermore, while a reduction in pain medication occurred, this was comparable in both groups. When results were analyzed using per-protocol analysis, improvements were observed for all outcomes in the yoga group, including agreater trend for reduced pain medication usage. Although slightly less than at 24 weeks, the yoga group had statistically significant reductions in functional disability, pain intensity, and depression compared to standard medical care 6-months postintervention. CONCLUSION: Yoga improves functional disability, pain intensity, and depression in adults with CLBP. There was also a clinically important trend for the yoga group to reduce their pain medication usage compared to the control group.

19694633	Effects of a yoga breath intervention alone and in combination with an exposure therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder and depression in survivors of the 2004 South-East Asia tsunami.	OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effect of a yoga breath program alone and followed by a trauma reduction exposure technique on post-traumatic stress disorder and depression in survivors of the 2004 Asian tsunami. METHOD: In this non-randomized study, 183 tsunami survivors who scored 50 or above on the Post-traumatic Checklist-17 (PCL-17) were assigned by camps to one of three groups: yoga breath intervention, yoga breath intervention followed by 3-8 h of trauma reduction exposure technique or 6-week wait list. Measures for post-traumatic stress disorder (PCL-17) and depression (BDI-21) were performed at baseline and at 6, 12 and 24 weeks. Data were analyzed using anova and mixed effects regression. RESULTS: The effect of treatment vs. control was significant at 6 weeks (F(2,178) = 279.616, P < 0.001): mean PCL-17 declined by 42.5 +/- 10.0 SD with yoga breath, 39.2 +/- 17.2 with Yoga breath + exposure and 4.6 +/- 13.2 in the control. CONCLUSION: Yoga breath-based interventions may help relieve psychological distress following mass disasters.

19690205	"Overeating is not about the food": women describe their experience of a yoga treatment program for binge eating.	As part of a larger mixed-methods study, data from 20 personal journals were analyzed to examine the experience of a 12-week yoga treatment program for binge eating among a sample of 25 women who were obese. Qualitative analysis revealed a positive shift experienced by the women during the program, summarized by a general structural description: disconnection versus connection. Women's comments suggested that the program appeared to encourage a healthy reconnection to food, as well as the development of physical self-empowerment, through cultivating present-moment awareness. Specifically, women perceived an overall reduction in the quantity of food they consumed, decreased eating speed, and an improvement in food choices throughout the program. The women also reported feeling more connected to and positive about their physical well-being. These evolving outcomes were summarized through two major themes: the way their physicality changed, and the way their food consumption changed over time. Findings provide insights relevant to therapeutic processes that might occur within eating disorder interventions that draw on meditation-based approaches.

19690044	Utilization of 3-month yoga program for adults at high risk for type 2 diabetes: a pilot study.	Various modes of physical activity, combined with dieting, have been widely recommended to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes. Among these, yoga holds promise for reducing risk factors for type 2 diabetes by promoting weight loss, improving glucose levels and reducing blood pressure and lipid levels. This pilot study aimed to assess the feasibility of implementing a 12-week yoga program among adults at high risk for type 2 diabetes. Twenty-three adults (19 Whites and 4 non-Whites) were randomly assigned to the yoga intervention group or the educational group. The yoga group participated in a 3-month yoga intervention with sessions twice per week and the educational group received general health educational materials every 2 weeks. All participants completed questionnaires and had blood tests at baseline and at the end of 3 months. Effect sizes were reported to summarize the efficacy of the intervention. All participants assigned to the yoga intervention completed the yoga program without complication and expressed high satisfaction with the program (99.2%). Their yoga session attendance ranged from 58.3 to 100%. Compared with the education group, the yoga group experienced improvements in weight, blood pressure, insulin, triglycerides and exercise self-efficacy indicated by small to large effect sizes. This preliminary study indicates that a yoga program would be a possible risk reduction option for adults at high risk for type 2 diabetes. In addition, yoga holds promise as an approach to reducing cardiometabolic risk factors and increasing exercise self-efficacy for this group.

19686231	Coping with a diagnosis of breast cancer-literature review and implications for developing countries.	Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women worldwide. Women are at an increased risk of developing both physical and psychological morbidity after diagnosis; however, many use different strategies to cope with the disease. The aim of this article is to review the available literature on the impact of breast cancer diagnoses and the strategies used by women to cope with this disease. The implications of these emerging findings are extrapolated within the context of health services provided in developing countries. Electronic databases were used to search the relevant literature. The findings showed that women who were diagnosed with breast cancer are at risk of developing several psychological morbidities such as depression, anxiety, fatigue, negative thoughts, suicidal thoughts, fear of dying, sense of aloneness, sexual and body images problems, as well as an overall decrease in the quality of life. Several strategies are used by women with breast cancer to cope with the disease, including positive cognitive restructuring, wishful thinking, emotional expression, disease acceptance, increased religious practice, family and social support, and yoga and exercise. Breast cancer diagnoses have been associated with several devastating psychological consequences; however, many women have used different coping strategies to adjust their lives accordingly. Healthcare professionals in developing countries, who work with women with breast cancer, should be aware of the different coping mechanisms that women use when diagnosed with cancer. Integrating a coping strategy into the treatment regimen would constitute an important milestone in the palliative care of patients with breast cancer.

19683130	A case of rectus sheath hematoma caused by yoga exercise.	Rectus sheath hematoma is a relatively rare condition but a significant cause of acute abdominal pain. The acute abdominal pain associated with rectus sheath hematoma can mimic several conditions, such as appendicitis, intestinal problems (obstruction, perforation, hernia, malignancy), and gynecologic disease (ovarian cyst, torsion, tubo-ovarian abscess, ectopic pregnancy). Correct diagnosis and subsequent treatment depends on careful history taking and appropriate use of diagnostic tools to avoid unnecessary laparotomy. We report a case of rectus sheath hematoma due to noncontact strenuous exercise, yoga, that mimicked gynecologic diseases.	Choi, Yoonhee;Lee, Donghoon	2009 Sep
19682666	Complementary medicine in the primary care setting: Results of a survey of gender and cultural patterns in Israel.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in a primary care practice in Israel to determine prevalence and patterns of use. METHODS: Trained research assistants invited all patients attending the administrative, medical, pharmaceutical, or nursing services of 7 clinics in urban and rural areas of northern Israel over a 16-month period, from April 1, 2005, through August 1, 2006, to complete a 13-item written questionnaire about CAM use and beliefs about CAM safety and efficacy. CAM was defined as therapies often referred to as alternative, complementary, natural, or folk/traditional medicine, and which are not usually offered as part of the medical treatment in the clinic, including herbal medicine, Chinese medicine (including acupuncture), homeopathy, folk and traditional remedies, dietary/nutritional therapy (including nutritional supplements), chiropractic, movement/manual healing therapies (including massage, reflexology, yoga, and Alexander and Feldenkrais techniques), mind-body techniques (including meditation, guided imagery, and relaxation), energy and healing therapies, and other naturopathic therapies. The Pearson chi(2) test and multivariate logistic regression were used to assess univariate associations with the odds ratios of CAM use among Arab and Jewish women. A t test was performed to determine whether there were any differences in the continuous variables between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Of 3972 consecutive patients who received the questionnaire, 3447 responded; 2139 respondents (62%) were women. Of the female respondents, 2121 reported their religion (1238 respondents [58%] self-identified as being Arab, and 883 [41.6%] as being Jewish). Compared with men, more women used CAM during the previous year (46.4% vs 39.4%; P < 0.001). Women were more likely to use CAM and to be interested in receiving CAM at primary care clinics. Arab women reported less CAM use than Jewish women but were more interested in experiencing CAM, had a higher degree of confidence in CAM efficacy and safety, and more frequently supported the integration of CAM practitioners in primary care clinics. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, women visiting primary care clinics in northern Israel used CAM more often than men did. Arab women reported less use of CAM than did Jewish women but also reported greater confidence in CAM efficacy and safety.

19682114	Yoga decreases kyphosis in senior women and men with adult-onset hyperkyphosis: results of a randomized controlled trial.	OBJECTIVES: To assess whether a specifically designed yoga intervention can reduce hyperkyphosis. DESIGN: A 6-month, two-group, randomized, controlled, single-masked trial. SETTING: Community research unit. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred eighteen women and men aged 60 and older with a kyphosis angle of 40 degrees or greater. Major exclusions were serious medical comorbidity, use of assistive device, inability to hear or see adequately for participation, and inability to pass a physical safety screen. INTERVENTION: The active treatment group attended hour-long yoga classes 3 days per week for 24 weeks. The control group attended a monthly luncheon and seminar and received mailings. MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcomes were change (baseline to 6 months) in Debrunner kyphometer-assessed kyphosis angle, standing height, timed chair stands, functional reach, and walking speed. Secondary outcomes were change in kyphosis index, flexicurve kyphosis angle, Rancho Bernardo Blocks posture assessment, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). RESULTS: Compared with control participants, participants randomized to yoga experienced a 4.4% improvement in flexicurve kyphosis angle (P=.006) and a 5% improvement in kyphosis index (P=.004). The intervention did not result in statistically significant improvement in Debrunner kyphometer angle, measured physical performance, or self-assessed HRQOL (each P>.1). CONCLUSION: The decrease in flexicurve kyphosis angle in the yoga treatment group shows that hyperkyphosis is remediable, a critical first step in the pathway to treating or preventing this condition. Larger, more-definitive studies of yoga or other interventions for hyperkyphosis should be considered. Targeting individuals with more-malleable spines and using longitudinally precise measures of kyphosis could strengthen the treatment effect.

19674483	Effect of two yoga-based relaxation techniques on memory scores and state anxiety.	BACKGROUND: A yoga practice involving cycles of yoga postures and supine rest (called cyclic meditation) was previously shown to improve performance in attention tasks more than relaxation in the corpse posture (shavasana). This was ascribed to reduced anxiety, though this was not assessed. METHODS: In fifty-seven male volunteers (group average age +/- S.D., 26.6 +/- 4.5 years) the immediate effect of two yoga relaxation techniques was studied on memory and state anxiety. All participants were assessed before and after (i) Cyclic meditation (CM) practiced for 22:30 minutes on one day and (ii) an equal duration of Supine rest (SR) or the corpse posture (shavasana), on another day. Sections of the Wechsler memory scale (WMS) were used to assess; (i) attention and concentration (digit span forward and backward), and (ii) associate learning. State anxiety was assessed using Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). RESULTS: There was a significant improvement in the scores of all sections of the WMS studied after both CM and SR, but, the magnitude of change was more after CM compared to after SR. The state anxiety scores decreased after both CM and SR, with a greater magnitude of decrease after CM. There was no correlation between percentage change in memory scores and state anxiety for either session. CONCLUSION: A cyclical combination of yoga postures and supine rest in CM improved memory scores immediately after the practice and decreased state anxiety more than rest in a classical yoga relaxation posture (shavasana).

19666194	Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) Clinical guidelines for the management of major depressive disorder in adults. V. Complementary and alternative medicine treatments.	BACKGROUND: In 2001, the Canadian Psychiatric Association and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) partnered to produce evidence-based clinical guidelines for the treatment of depressive disorders. A revision of these guidelines was undertaken by CANMAT in 2008-2009 to reflect advances in the field. There is widespread interest in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). METHODS: The CANMAT guidelines are based on a question-answer format to enhance accessibility to clinicians. An evidence-based format was used with updated systematic reviews of the literature and recommendations were graded according to Level of Evidence using pre-defined criteria. Lines of Treatment were identified based on criteria that included evidence and expert clinical support. This section on "Complementary and Alternative Medicine Treatments" is one of 5 guideline articles. RESULTS: There is Level 1 evidence to support light therapy in seasonal MDD and St. John's wort in mild to moderate MDD. There is also some evidence for the use of exercise, yoga and sleep deprivation, as well as for omega-3 fatty acids and SAM-e . Support for other natural health products and therapies is still limited. LIMITATIONS: The evidence base remains limited and studies often have methodological problems, including small samples, variability in dose, short duration of treatment, unknown quality of the agent and limited long-term data. Safety data are also sparse with little information about drug interactions. CONCLUSIONS: Some CAM treatments have evidence of benefit in MDD. However, problems with standardization and safety concerns may limit their applicability in clinical practice.

19657730	Yoga ameliorates performance anxiety and mood disturbance in young professional musicians.	Yoga and meditation can alleviate stress, anxiety, mood disturbance, and musculoskeletal problems, and can enhance cognitive and physical performance. Professional musicians experience high levels of stress, performance anxiety, and debilitating performance-related musculoskeletal disorders (PRMDs). The goal of this controlled study was to evaluate the benefits of yoga and meditation for musicians. Young adult professional musicians who volunteered to participate in a 2-month program of yoga and meditation were randomized to a yoga lifestyle intervention group (n = 15) or to a group practicing yoga and meditation only (n = 15). Additional musicians were recruited to a no-practice control group (n = 15). Both yoga groups attended three Kripalu Yoga or meditation classes each week. The yoga lifestyle group also experienced weekly group practice and discussion sessions as part of their more immersive treatment. All participants completed baseline and end-program self-report questionnaires that evaluated music performance anxiety, mood, PRMDs, perceived stress, and sleep quality; many participants later completed a 1-year followup assessment using the same questionnaires. Both yoga groups showed a trend towards less music performance anxiety and significantly less general anxiety/tension, depression, and anger at end-program relative to controls, but showed no changes in PRMDs, stress, or sleep. Similar results in the two yoga groups, despite psychosocial differences in their interventions, suggest that the yoga and meditation techniques themselves may have mediated the improvements. Our results suggest that yoga and meditation techniques can reduce performance anxiety and mood disturbance in young professional musicians.

19643002	The efficacy of a comprehensive lifestyle modification programme based on yoga in the management of bronchial asthma: a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: There is a substantial body of evidence on the efficacy of yoga in the management of bronchial asthma. Many studies have reported, as the effects of yoga on bronchial asthma, significant improvements in pulmonary functions, quality of life and reduction in airway hyper-reactivity, frequency of attacks and medication use. In addition, a few studies have attempted to understand the effects of yoga on exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) or exercise tolerance capacity. However, none of these studies has investigated any immunological mechanisms by which yoga improves these variables in bronchial asthma. METHODS: The present randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted on 57 adult subjects with mild or moderate bronchial asthma who were allocated randomly to either the yoga (intervention) group (n = 29) or the wait-listed control group (n = 28). The control group received only conventional care and the yoga group received an intervention based on yoga, in addition to the conventional care. The intervention consisted of 2-wk supervised training in lifestyle modification and stress management based on yoga followed by closely monitored continuation of the practices at home for 6-wk. The outcome measures were assessed in both the groups at 0 wk (baseline), 2, 4 and 8 wk by using Generalized Linear Model (GLM) repeated measures followed by post-hoc analysis. RESULTS: In the yoga group, there was a steady and progressive improvement in pulmonary function, the change being statistically significant in case of the first second of forced expiratory volume (FEV1) at 8 wk, and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) at 2, 4 and 8 wk as compared to the corresponding baseline values. There was a significant reduction in EIB in the yoga group. However, there was no corresponding reduction in the urinary prostaglandin D2 metabolite (11beta prostaglandin F2alpha) levels in response to the exercise challenge. There was also no significant change in serum eosinophilic cationic protein levels during the 8-wk study period in either group. There was a significant improvement in Asthma Quality of Life (AQOL) scores in both groups over the 8-wk study period. But the improvement was achieved earlier and was more complete in the yoga group. The number-needed-to-treat worked out to be 1.82 for the total AQOL score. An improvement in total AQOL score was greater than the minimal important difference and the same outcome was achieved for the sub-domains of the AQOL. The frequency of rescue medication use showed a significant decrease over the study period in both the groups. However, the decrease was achieved relatively earlier and was more marked in the yoga group than in the control group. CONCLUSION: The present RCT has demonstrated that adding the mind-body approach of yoga to the predominantly physical approach of conventional care results in measurable improvement in subjective as well as objective outcomes in bronchial asthma. The trial supports the efficacy of yoga in the management of bronchial asthma. However, the preliminary efforts made towards working out the mechanism of action of the intervention have not thrown much light on how yoga works in bronchial asthma.

19632546	Yoga as a treatment for binge eating disorder: a preliminary study.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of a 12-week yoga program aimed at reducing binge eating severity. DESIGN: A randomised trial was undertaken assigning participants to yoga (n=45) or wait-list control (n=45) groups. Of these, 25 in each group were analysed. PARTICIPANTS: A community-based sample of women between 25 and 63 years of age who identified with diagnostic criteria for binge eating disorder (BED) and a BMI>25 were recruited for the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes included the Binge Eating Scale (BES) and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Secondary outcomes comprised measures for BMI, hips and waist. RESULTS: For the yoga group, self-reported reductions in binge eating and increases in physical activity were statistically significant. Small yet statistically significant reductions for BMI, hips and waist measurement were obtained. The wait-list control group did not improve significantly on any measures. CONCLUSION: In conjunction with formal weekly sessions, home-based yoga programs are potentially efficacious for the treatment of binge eating.

19631053	Development and validation of the mindful eating questionnaire.	"Mindful eating" describes a nonjudgmental awareness of physical and emotional sensations associated with eating. This article reports the development of a mindful eating questionnaire (MEQ) to support rigorous scientific inquiry into this concept. An item pool was developed based on hypothesized domains of mindful eating. A cross-sectional survey examined associations of MEQ scores with demographic and health-related characteristics. The MEQ was distributed to seven convenience samples between January and May 2007, with an overall response rate of 62% (n=303). Participants were mostly women (81%) and white (90%), and had a mean age of 42+/-14.4 years (range 18 to 80 years). Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify factors, which were defined as the mean of items scored one to four, where four indicated higher mindfulness; the mean of all factors was the summary MEQ score. Multiple regression analysis was used to measure associations of demographic characteristics, obesity, yoga practice, and physical activity with MEQ scores. Domains of the final 28-item questionnaire were: disinhibition, awareness, external cues, emotional response, and distraction. The mean MEQ score was 2.92+/-0.37, with a reliability (Chronbach's alpha) of .64. The covariate-adjusted MEQ score was inversely associated with body mass index (3.02 for body mass index <25 vs 2.54 for body mass index >30, P<0.001). Yoga practice, but neither walking nor moderate/intense physical activity, was associated with higher MEQ score. In this study sample, the MEQ had good measurement characteristics. Its negative association with body mass index and positive association with yoga provide evidence of construct validity. Further evaluation in more diverse populations is warranted.

19626355	Theta activity and meditative states: spectral changes during concentrative meditation.	Brain oscillatory activity is associated with different cognitive processes and plays a critical role in meditation. In this study, we investigated the temporal dynamics of oscillatory changes during Sahaj Samadhi meditation (a concentrative form of meditation that is part of Sudarshan Kriya yoga). EEG was recorded during Sudarshan Kriya yoga meditation for meditators and relaxation for controls. Spectral and coherence analysis was performed for the whole duration as well as specific blocks extracted from the initial, middle, and end portions of Sahaj Samadhi meditation or relaxation. The generation of distinct meditative states of consciousness was marked by distinct changes in spectral powers especially enhanced theta band activity during deep meditation in the frontal areas. Meditators also exhibited increased theta coherence compared to controls. The emergence of the slow frequency waves in the attention-related frontal regions provides strong support to the existing claims of frontal theta in producing meditative states along with trait effects in attentional processing. Interestingly, increased frontal theta activity was accompanied reduced activity (deactivation) in parietal-occipital areas signifying reduction in processing associated with self, space and, time.

19623830	Functional and physiological effects of yoga in women with rheumatoid arthritis: a pilot study.	CONTEXT: Stress, both psychological and physiological, has been implicated as having a role in the onset and exacerbations of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether neuroendocrine and physical function in women with RA can be altered through a yoga intervention. DESIGN: Exercise intervention. SETTING: University research conducted at a medical clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen independently living, postmenopausal women with an RA classification of I, II, or III according to the American College of Rheumatology functional classification system served as either participants or controls. INTERVENTION: The study group participated in three 75-minute yoga classes a week over a 10-week period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: At baseline and on completion of the 10-week intervention, diurnal cortisol patterns and resting heart rate were measured. Balance was measured using the Berg Balance Test. Participants completed the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HIQ), a visual analog pain scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory. RESULTS: Yoga resulted in a significantly decreased HAQ disability index, decreased perception of pain and depression, and improved balance. Yoga did not result in a significant change in awakening or diurnal cortisol patterns (P = .12).	Bosch, Pamela R;Traustadottir, Tinna;Howard, Paul;Matt, Kathleen S	2009 Jul-Aug
19608122	Clinical applications of yoga for the pediatric population: a systematic review.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the evidence for clinical applications of yoga among the pediatric population. METHODS: We conducted an electronic literature search including CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EMBASE, Medline, PsycINFO, and manual search of retrieved articles from inception of each database until December 2008. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and nonrandomized controlled trials (NRCTs) were selected that included yoga or yoga-based interventions for individuals aged 0 to 21 years. Data were extracted and articles critically reviewed using a modified Jadad score and descriptive methodological criteria, with summarization in tables. RESULTS: Thirty-four controlled studies published from 1979 to 2008 were identified, with 19 RCTS and 15 NRCTs. Many studies were of low methodological quality. Clinical areas for which yoga has been studied include physical fitness, cardiorespiratory effects, motor skills/strength, mental health and psychological disorders, behavior and development, irritable bowel syndrome, and birth outcomes following prenatal yoga. No adverse events were reported in trials reviewed. Although a large majority of studies were positive, methodological limitations such as randomization methods, withdrawal/dropouts, and details of yoga intervention preclude conclusive evidence. CONCLUSIONS: There are limited data on the clinical applications of yoga among the pediatric population. Most published controlled trials were suggestive of benefit, but results are preliminary based on low quantity and quality of trials. Further research of yoga for children by using a higher standard of methodology and reporting is warranted.

19607666	Getting the balance right: a randomised controlled trial of physiotherapy and Exercise Interventions for ambulatory people with multiple sclerosis.	BACKGROUND: People with Multiple Sclerosis have a life long need for physiotherapy and exercise interventions due to the progressive nature of the disease and their greater risk of the complications of inactivity. The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Ireland run physiotherapy, yoga and exercise classes for their members, however there is little evidence to suggest which form of physical activity optimises outcome for people with the many and varied impairments associated with MS. METHODS AND DESIGN: This is a multi-centre, single blind, block randomised, controlled trial. Participants will be recruited via the ten regional offices of MS Ireland. Telephone screening will establish eligibility and stratification according to the mobility section of the Guys Neurological Disability Scale. Once a block of people of the same strand in the same geographical region have given consent, participants will be randomised. Strand A will concern individuals with MS who walk independently or use one stick to walk outside. Participants will be randomised to yoga, physiotherapy led exercise class, fitness instructor led exercise class or to a control group who don't change their exercise habits.Strand B will concern individuals with MS who walk with bilateral support or a rollator, they may use a wheelchair for longer distance outdoors. Participants will be randomised to 1:1 Physiotherapist led intervention, group intervention led by Physiotherapist, group yoga intervention or a control group who don't change their exercise habits. Participants will be assessed by physiotherapist who is blind to the group allocation at week 1, week 12 (following 10 weeks intervention or control), and at 12 week follow up. The primary outcome measure for both strands is the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale. Secondary outcomes are Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, 6 Minute Walk test, and muscle strength measured with hand held dynamometry. Strand B will also use Berg Balance Test and the Modified Ashworth Scale. Confounding variables such as sensation, coordination, proprioception, range of motion and other impairments will be recorded at initial assessment. DISCUSSION: Data analysis will analyse change in each group, and the differences between groups. Sub group analysis may be performed if sufficient numbers are recruited. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN77610415.	Coote, Susan;Garrett, Maria;Hogan, Neasa;Larkin, Aidan;Saunders, Jean	2009 Jul 16
19606645	Psychosocial correlates and outcomes of yoga or walking among older adults.	Few researchers have compared psychological correlates and outcomes of yoga with more traditional forms of exercise. The authors' primary aim was to compare changes in the psychosocial outcomes of mood and state anxiety produced by an acute bout of yoga or walking among older adults. The secondary aim was to compare selected psychosocial correlates of activity. Participants were 51 adults who were 50 years of age or older who walked for exercise or participated in a yoga class. Results revealed that yoga participants had significantly greater levels of depression and perceived barriers to exercise, and lower quality of life than did walkers. With control for these differences, yoga practitioners had improved levels of fatigue pre- to postsession, compared with walkers. With control for differences in demographic variables, these changes were no longer significant. It is possible that yoga practitioners seek out mindful-based exercise to cope with greater levels of depression and lower levels of quality of life.	Kraemer, Jennifer M;Marquez, David X	2009 Jul
19586429	Advances in the treatment of menopausal symptoms.	Vasomotor symptoms and vaginal atrophy are both common menopausal symptoms. Hormone therapy is currently the only FDA-approved treatment for hot flashes. Current recommendations are to use the lowest dose of hormone therapy for the shortest period that will allow treatment goals to be met. Although the reanalysis of the WHI in 2007 by Roussow et al. provided evidence of coronary heart safety for users of hormone therapy under the age of 60 years and within 10 years of the onset of menopause, not all women desire or are candidates for hormone therapy. In this review we present an evidence-based discussion considering the effectiveness of hormonal and nonhormonal therapies for the relief of vasomotor symptoms and vaginal atrophy. Concern exists regarding systemic absorption of vaginal estrogen and possible adverse effects on the breast and uterus. Selective estrogen receptor modulators and estrogen agonists offer benefits through targeted estrogen agonist/antagonistic effects and are being evaluated with and without estrogen for symptomatic menopausal women. Centrally acting nonhormonal therapies that are effective for the relief of vasomotor symptoms include various antidepressants, gabapentin and clonidine. A limited number of clinical trials have been conducted with nonprescription remedies, including paced respiration, yoga, acupuncture, exercise, homeopathy and magnet therapy, and some, but not all of these, have been found to be more effective than placebo. Dietary herbal supplements, such as soy and black cohosh, have demonstrated mixed and inconclusive results in placebo-controlled trials. Potential therapies for vasomotor symptoms and vaginal atrophy require randomized, placebo-controlled trials of sufficient duration to establish efficacy and safety. Agents under investigation for vasomotor symptoms relief include neuroactive agents, such as gabapentin and desvenlafaxine; an estrogen receptor-beta-targeted herbal therapy, MF-101; and the selective estrogen receptor modulator, bazedoxifene, paired with estrogen.

19585761	Effect of Raja yoga meditation on the lipid profile of post-menopausal women.	BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease is an important cause of death and disability among older women. Modification in lipid profile lowers the risk of coronary artery disease. It is claimed that yoga and transcendental meditation have a cholesterol lowering effect. This study was designed to assess the effect of raja yoga meditation of Brahmakumaris which is very simple to practice, on serum lipids in normal Indian women. METHODS AND RESULTS: 49 normal female volunteers were the subjects. They were divided into pre-menopausal (n=23) and post-menopausal (n=26) groups. They were further divided into non-meditators (who had never done any kind of meditation), short-term meditators (meditating for 6 months to 5 years) and long-term meditators (meditating for more than 5 years). Lipid profile was assessed using their respective reagent sets. Serum cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol in nonmeditators were significantly more in post-menopausal women as compared to pre-menopausal women. Serum cholesterol and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol were significantly lowered in both short and long term meditators as compared to non-meditators in post-menopausal women. No significant difference was observed in lipid profile in pre-menopausal women.

19585757	A method for computerised recording and analysis of high frequency biopotentials (oscillometry).	Oscillometry records the high frequency electrical activity on the skin surface. These are induced by external ambient electromagnetic radiations, and generated internally by physiological processes. The existence of these surface A.C. oscillations is fundamental to the existence of an electromagnetic field around the human body. Unfiltered electrical and inductive signals are digitally recorded using the computer sound card and audio analysis software. The power and frequency content of the signal is measured. A sound card with a sample rate of 96 KHz enables FFT from 0 to 45 KHz. It can be used to study the electrical response of the body to externally administered electromagnetic radiations. Some of the responses seen during yoga practices are capable of inductive influences.	Mendanha, R E	2008 Oct-Dec
19564829	Positive impact of cyclic meditation on subsequent sleep.	BACKGROUND: Cyclic meditation (CM) is a technique that combines yoga postures interspersed with supine rest. This combination is based on ancient texts and is considered easier for beginners to practice. MATERIAL/METHODS: Whole-night polysomnographic measures and the self-rating of sleep were studied on the night following a day in which 30 male participants practiced CM twice (ca. 23 minutes each time). This was compared with another night when they had had two sessions of supine rest (SR) of equal duration on the preceding day. The sessions were one day apart and the order of the sessions was randomized. Recordings were from the F4, C4, and O2 electrode sites referenced to linked earlobes and bipolar electroculography and electromyography sites. RESULTS: In the night following CM, the percentage of slow-wave sleep (SWS) was significantly higher than in the night following SR, whereas the percentage of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep and the number of awakenings per hour were less. Following CM the self-rating of sleep based on visual analog scales showed an increase in the feeling that the sleep was refreshing, an increase in feeling "good" in the morning, an overall increase in sleep duration, and decreases in the degree to which sleep was influenced by being in a laboratory as well as any associated discomfort. CONCLUSIONS: Practicing cyclic meditation twice a day appeared to improve the objective and subjective quality of sleep on the following night.	Patra, Sanjib;Telles, Shirley	2009 Jul
20842268	Effects of yoga on symptom management in breast cancer patients: A randomized controlled trial.	OBJECTIVES: This study compares the effects of an integrated yoga program with brief supportive therapy on distressful symptoms in breast cancer outpatients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-eight stage II and III breast cancer outpatients were randomly assigned to receive yoga (n = 44) or brief supportive therapy (n = 44) prior to their radiotherapy treatment. Intervention consisted of yoga sessions lasting 60 min daily while the control group was imparted supportive therapy once in 10 days during the course of their adjuvant radiotherapy. Assessments included Rotterdam Symptom Check List and European Organization for Research in the Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life (EORTC QoL C30) symptom scale. Assessments were done at baseline and after 6 weeks of radiotherapy treatment. RESULTS: A GLM repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant decrease in psychological distress (P = 0.01), fatigue (P = 0.007), insomnia (P = 0.001), and appetite loss (P = 0.002) over time in the yoga group as compared to controls. There was significant improvement in the activity level (P = 0.02) in the yoga group as compared to controls. There was a significant positive correlation between physical and psychological distress and fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, and constipation. There was a significant negative correlation between the activity level and fatigue, nausea and vomiting, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, and appetite loss. CONCLUSION: The results suggest beneficial effects with yoga intervention in managing cancer-and treatment-related symptoms in breast cancer patients.

20842267	Normative data for the digit-letter substitution task in school children.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: To establish the norms for the substitution task, a measure of psychomotor performance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight hundred and forty three school students were selected in the present study aged between 9-16 years (mean age = 12.14; SD = 1.77). Subjects were assessed one at a time for Digit-Letter Substitution Task (DLST). RESULTS: Both age and sex influenced performance on the DLST; therefore, correction scores were obtained on the basis of these factors. CONCLUSIONS: The availability of the Indian normative data for the DLST will allow wider application of this test in clinical practice.	Pradhan, Balaram;Nagendra, Hr	2009 Jul
20842266	Motion analysis of sun salutation using magnetometer and accelerometer.	BACKGROUND: Sun salutation is a part of yoga. It consists of a sequence of postures done with synchronized breathing. The practice of few cycles of sun salutation is known to help in maintaining good health and vigor. The practice of sun salutation does not need any extra gadgets. Also it is very much aerobic and invigorates the body and the mind. sun salutation, which comprises 10 postures, involves most of the joints of the body. Understanding the transition phase during motion is a challenging task, and thus, new convenient methods need to be employed. AIMS: The purpose of this study was to get an insight into the motion analysis of sun salutation during the transition from each of the 10 postures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A device MicroStrain sensor 3DM-GX1, which is a combination of magnetometers, accelerometers, and gyroscopes was used to measure the inclination and the acceleration of the body along the three axes. The acceleration obtained was then separated into gravitational and kinematic components. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The value of the gravitational component helps us to understand the position of the body and the kinematic component helps us to analyze the grace of the motion.

20842265	Effect of yogic education system and modern education system on memory.	BACKGROUND/AIM: Memory is more associated with the temporal cortex than other cortical areas. The two main components of memory are spatial and verbal which relate to right and left hemispheres of the brain, respectively. Many investigations have shown the beneficial effects of yoga on memory and temporal functions of the brain. This study was aimed at comparing the effect of one Gurukula Education System (GES) school based on a yoga way of life with a school using the Modern Education System (MES) on memory. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty nine boys of ages ranging from 11-13 years were selected from each of two residential schools, one MES and the other GES, providing similar ambiance and daily routines. The boys were matched for age and socioeconomic status. The GES educational program is based around integrated yoga modules while the MES provides a conventional modern education program. Memory was assessed by means of standard spatial and verbal memory tests applicable to Indian conditions before and after an academic year. RESULTS: Between groups there was matching at start of the academic year, while after it the GES boys showed significant enhancement in both verbal and visual memory scores than MES boys (P < 0.001, Mann-Whitney test). CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that the GES meant for total personality development adopting yoga way of life is more effective in enhancing visual and verbal memory scores than the MES.

20842264	Cardiovascular and metabolic effects of intensive Hatha Yoga training in middle-aged and older women from northern Mexico.	BACKGROUND: Hatha Yoga (HY) can be an alternative to improve physical activity in middle-aged and older women. However, conventional HY (CHY) exercising may not result in enough training stimulus to improve cardiovascular fitness. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of an intensive HY intervention (IHY) on cardiovascular risk factors in middle-aged and older women from Northern Mexico. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective quasiexperimental design, four middle-aged and nine older CHY practicing females (yoginis) were enrolled into an 11-week IHY program consisting of 5 sessions/week for 90 min (55 sessions). The program adherence, asana performance, and work intensity were assessed along the intervention. Anthropometric [body mass index (BMI), % body fat and Sigma skin folds], cardiovascular fitness [maximal expired air volume (VE(max)), maximal O(2) consumption (VO(2max)), maximal heart rate (HR(max)), systolic (BPs) and diastolic blood pressure (BPd)], biochemical [glucose, triacylglycerols (TAG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)], and dietary parameters were evaluated before and after IHY. RESULTS: Daily caloric intake (~1,916 kcal/day), program adherence (~85%), and exercising skills (asana performance) were similar in both middle-aged and older women. The IHY program did not modify any anthropometric measurements. However, it increased VO(2max) and VE(max) and HDL-C while TAG and LDL-C remained stable in both middle-aged and older groups (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The proposed IHY program improves different cardiovascular risk factors (namely VO(2max) and HDL-C) in middle-aged and older women.

19548145	Body awareness, eating attitudes, and spiritual beliefs of women practicing yoga.	This research evaluated attitudes about body image and eating in women practicing postural yoga. Study 1 described scores from questionnaires on variables related to body awareness, intuitive eating, spirituality, and reasons for practicing. Scores were favorable on all measures with significant correlations (p < .01) among all main variables except between spiritual readiness and intuitive eating, and between BMI and both body awareness and spiritual readiness. Reasons for practicing did not affect scores. Study 2 evaluated interviews in a sub-sample. Qualitative data reported improvements in body satisfaction and disordered eating due in part to yoga and its associated spirituality.	Dittmann, K A;Freedman, M R	2009 Jul-Sep
19540943	Endoscopic varicocelectomy by extraperitoneal route: a novel technique.	BACKGROUND: Varicocelectomy for male infertility has been performed laparoscopically by transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) approach. Laparoscopic varicocelectomy (LV) has a potential risk of intraperitoneal injuries. LV fails to tackle the possible collateral veins in inguinal canal below the deep inguinal ring. Despite the inherent benefits of retro or extraperitoneal approach for urological procedures, the extraperitoneal varicocelectomy has not been widely practiced. Energy sources have been suspected in potential trauma to vas. Totally extraperitoneal (TEP) approach is a well established procedure for inguinal region. We utilized TEP approach to perform varicocelectomy without using energy source. METHOD: Between January 2000 and March 2005 16 males having bilateral varicocele, subnormal semen parameters and inability to father a child with reproductively healthy female partner were operated. Varicocelectomy was done by TEP route. RESULTS: 16 males having different grades of varicocele, mean sperm counts of 29.25 million/ml and mean sperm motility of 26% were operated. There was no technical difficulty, visceral injury, conversion, bleeding or need to use energy source. There was no recurrence or reduction in testicular size. Postoperative hydroceles (11 out of 32 varicoceles) resolved within 3 months without any intervention. Mean sperm counts and motility improved to 68.25 million/ml and 63.18% respectively. Pregnancy was reported by 11 couples during a follow up of 2 years. CONCLUSION: Endoscopic varicocelectomy by extraperitoneal route is a safe procedure.	Agarwal, Brij B;Manish, Kumar	2009 Aug
19538619	The effects of mindfulness-based yoga during pregnancy on maternal psychological and physical distress.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility and level of acceptability of a mindful yoga intervention provided during pregnancy and to gather preliminary data on the efficacy of the intervention in reducing distress. DESIGN: Baseline and post-treatment measures examined state and trait anxiety, perceived stress, pain, and morning salivary cortisol in a single treatment group. Postintervention data also included participant evaluation of the intervention. SETTING: The 7 weeks mindfulness-based yoga group intervention combined elements of Iyengar yoga and mindfulness-based stress reduction. PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen healthy pregnant nulliparous women with singleton pregnancies between 12 and 32 weeks gestation at the time of enrollment. METHODS: Outcomes were evaluated from pre- to postintervention and between second and third trimesters with repeated measures analysis of variance and post hoc nonparametric tests. RESULTS: Women practicing mindful yoga in their second trimester reported significant reductions in physical pain from baseline to postintervention compared with women in the third trimester whose pain increased. Women in their third trimester showed greater reductions in perceived stress and trait anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence supports yoga's potential efficacy in these areas, particularly if started early in the pregnancy.

19534616	Effect of slow- and fast-breathing exercises on autonomic functions in patients with essential hypertension.	OBJECTIVES: Breathing exercises practiced in various forms of meditations such as yoga may influence autonomic functions. This may be the basis of therapeutic benefit to hypertensive patients. DESIGN: The study design was a randomized, prospective, controlled clinical study using three groups. SUBJECTS: The subjects comprised 60 male and female patients aged 20-60 years with stage 1 essential hypertension. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly and equally divided into the control and other two intervention groups, who were advised to do 3 months of slow-breathing and fast-breathing exercises, respectively. Baseline and postintervention recording of blood pressure (BP), autonomic function tests such as standing-to-lying ratio (S/L ratio), immediate heart rate response to standing (30:15 ratio), Valsalva ratio, heart rate variation with respiration (E/I ratio), hand-grip test, and cold pressor response were done in all subjects. RESULTS: Slow breathing had a stronger effect than fast breathing. BP decreased longitudinally over a 3-month period with both interventions. S/L ratio, 30:15 ratio, E/I ratio, and BP response in the hand grip and cold pressor test showed significant change only in patients practicing the slow-breathing exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Both types of breathing exercises benefit patients with hypertension. However, improvement in both the sympathetic and parasympathetic reactivity may be the mechanism that is associated in those practicing the slow-breathing exercise.

19523233	Interleukin-6 as an early marker for fat embolism.	BACKGROUND: Fat Embolism is a complication of long bone fractures, intramedullary fixation and joint arthroplasty. It may progress to fat embolism syndrome, which is rare but involves significant morbidity and can occasionally be fatal. Fat Embolism can be detected at the time of embolization by transoesophageal echocardiography or atrial blood sampling. Later, a combination of clinical signs and symptoms will point towards fat embolism but there is no specific test to confirm the diagnosis. We investigated serum Interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a possible early marker for fat embolism. METHODS: An animal study was conducted to simulate a hip replacement in 31 adult male Sprague Dawley rats. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia and the animals divided into 3 groups: control, uncemented and cemented. Following surgery and recovery from anaesthesia, the rats allowed to freely mobilize in their cages. Blood was taken before surgery and at 6 hours, 12 hours and 24 hours to measure serum IL-6 levels. The rats were euthanized at 24 hours and lungs removed and stained for fat. The amount of fat seen was then correlated with serum IL-6 levels. RESULTS: No rats in the control group had fat emboli. Numerous fat emboli were seen in both the uncemented and cemented implant groups. The interleukin levels were raised in all groups reaching a peak at 12 hours after surgery reaching 100 pg/ml in the control group and around 250 pg/ml in the uncemented and cemented implant groups. The IL-6 levels in the control group were significantly lower than any of the implant groups at 12 and 24 hours. At these time points, the serum IL-6 correlated with the amount of fat seen on lung histology. CONCLUSION: Serum IL-6 is a possible early marker of fat embolism.

19515284	Alternative approaches to epilepsy treatment.	Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a diverse group of health care practices and products that fall outside the realm of traditional Western medical theory and practice and that are used to complement or replace conventional medical therapies. The use of CAM has increased over the past two decades, and surveys have shown that up to 44% of patients with epilepsy are using some form of CAM treatment. This article reviews the CAM modalities of meditation, yoga, relaxation techniques, biofeedback, nutritional and herbal supplements, dietary measures, chiropractic care, acupuncture, Reiki, and homeopathy and what is known about their potential efficacy in patients with epilepsy.

19493149	Effect of dietary behaviour modification on anthropometric indices and eating behaviour in obese adolescent girls.	AIM: This paper is a report of a study conducted to evaluate the effects of behaviour modification on anthropometric indices and to explore if behaviour modification could improve eating behaviour in adolescents. BACKGROUND: Obesity is currently the most important nutritional disease of children and adolescents. To date, several attempts to achieve weight loss in children have been made, but little is known about their effects on improving eating behaviours. METHOD: Sixty obese adolescent girls participated in a behaviour modification program which was held for 16 weeks in 2007. The participants were randomly selected from two different schools and were assigned to an experimental and control group (30 participants each). Anthropometric indices and eating behaviours were assessed before and after the program. Eating behaviour was assessed using the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire. RESULT: There were statistically significant differences in changes in body weight (-2.75 kg vs. 0.62 kg), body mass index (-1.07 kg/m(2) vs. 0.24 kg/m(2)) and arm circumference (-2.31 cm vs. 0.5 cm) in the experimental group in contrast to controls (P < 0.001). There were also statistically significant differences in scores for eating behaviour, emotional eating (0.63, 0.17), external eating (0.99, 0.05) and restrained eating (0.72, 0.03) in the experimental vs. the control group respectively (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Nurses, more than other healthcare professionals, can address obesity in adolescents and they should not concentrate solely on weight reduction, but also encourage children to acquire a healthy lifestyle.

19482233	Subjective Sleep Quality and hormonal modulation in long-term yoga practitioners.	Yoga represents a fascinating mind-body approach, wherein body movements (asana), breathing exercises (pranayama) and meditation are integrated into a single multidimensional practice. Numerous beneficial mental and physical effects have been classically ascribed to this holistic ancient method. The purpose of the present study has been to examine the effects of long-term yoga practice on Subjective Sleep Quality (SSQ) and on several hormonal parameters of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Twenty-six subjects (16 experimental and 10 controls) were recruited to be part of the study. Experimental subjects were regular yoga practitioners with a minimum of 3 years of practice. Blood samples for the quantification of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S) were drawn from all subjects. Likewise, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was employed to assess SSQ. As statistical analysis, Mann-Whitney U-test was performed. The yoga group displayed lower PSQI scores and higher blood cortisol levels than control subjects. Therefore, it can be concluded that long-term yoga practice is associated with significant psycho-biological differences, including better sleep quality as well as a modulatory action on the levels of cortisol. These preliminary results suggest interesting clinical implications which should be further researched.

22122626	Review of Whole person healthcare, Volumes 1, 2, & 3 (2007).	Reviews the book, Whole person healthcare, Volumes 1, 2, & 3 by I. A. Serlin, M. A. DiCowden, K. Rockefeller, S. Brown, J. Sonke-Henderson, R. Brandman, and J. Graham-Pole (2007). With the more-than-1,000-page tour de force titled Whole Person Healthcare, Ilene Serlin, current president of the San Francisco Psychological Association, has purposefully edited a three-volume series aimed at humanizing the fields of psychotherapy and health care. Throughout the series, all of the authors carry the message that integrative treatment strategies in psychotherapy and health care are more valuable than reductionist "treat the symptom rather than the person" approaches as a way to humanize patient-client interaction. Whole Person Healthcare persuasively presents the principle reasons for integrating human-centered strategies into psychotherapeutic and health care practices. Volume 1 of the series, Humanizing Healthcare, sets the tone for the other two volumes, providing a conceptual scaffold for framing humanistic and positive psychological theories within an applied health care setting. Volume 2 of the series, Psychology, Spirituality, and Health, focuses on presenting concrete, evidence-based examples of integrative therapeutic techniques such as imagery and visualization, meditation, meaning finding, prayer and psychospiritual practices, yoga, tai chi, and qi gong. Volume 3 of the series, The Arts and Health, provides a critically important contribution to the field because the art therapies are so often forgotten in the world of managed health care. Volume 3 gives evidence-based examples of the valuable contributions of artistic interactions within therapeutic contexts. The collection of readings in Whole Person Healthcare covers a wide spectrum of modern healing approaches, and this series is a must for any practitioner of integrative, holistic therapies. However, there are two practical barriers of note. First is cost: The price is too steep for most readers, especially students and new professionals who are still in the process of training. Second is accessibility: In the age of instant Internet access and hyperlink text, the content could be more available to both clients and therapists as a Web-based resource. Those two reservations aside, I would urge serious consideration of Whole Person Healthcare. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved).	Harvey, Richard	2009 Jun
21631851	Evidence-based review of therapies at the menopause.	Background and Objective The highest level of scientific evidence available for each therapy for menopausal symptoms was sought, for example, systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Results There is reasonable evidence that some symptoms are modified by lifestyle, for example, cessation of smoking, exercise, reduction of alcohol, diet and alleviation of psychosocial stress. No complementary medicine, for example, phytoestrogens, black cohosh, herbal or homeopathic medicines or complementary therapies, for example, acupuncture, yoga, chiropractic manipulation, reflexology or magnetic devices have a greater effect than the usual placebo effect seen in quality blinded RCTs. Some have potential side-effects. So-called 'bioidentical hormones' have no evidence-base and potential for harm. None of the above therapies have evidence of efficacy and long-term safety. Selective serotonin and noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors ameliorate vasomotor symptoms and sometimes menopausal depression better than placebo. The most effective therapy for menopausal (oestrogen) deficiency symptoms is oestrogen which is the main component of hormone replacement therapies (HRT). Compared with placebo HRT is highly effective in relieving hot flushes, night sweats, dry vagina and dyspareunia. It also improved joint pains, sexuality and sleeplessness and reduced subsequent fractures in RCTs. The increased risk of oral HRT for thromboembolism is small around menopause, for those without thrombotic risk factors, and is not elevated with non-oral routes. Cardiovascular disease may be reduced when HRT is initiated near menopause. Breast cancer risk increases after several years with the use of oral HRT containing progestogens at an annual rate of 8/10 000 (<0.1%). No increase in breast cancer risk was seen with oestrogen-only HRT.	Maclennan, Alastair H	2009 Jun
19476768	Complementary and alternative medicine use among patients undergoing otolaryngologic surgery.	OBJECTIVE: The use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) may influence surgical care by inducing coagulopathies and interacting with other medication. We investigated the prevalence and pattern of CAM use in patients admitted to our department for elective otolaryngologic surgery. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Tertiary care referral centre in northeast Scotland. METHOD AND PATIENTS: All adult patients admitted for elective surgery, over a 14-week period from October 2005 to January 2006, were requested to complete an anonymous questionnaire. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics using SPSS version 12 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To establish the prevalence of CAM use in patients admitted for surgery in our unit. Secondary measures included the type of CAM used, indications for use, perceived benefit, and communication with the family physician. RESULTS: Sixty-three percent (177 of 285) of the patient group had used CAM-36% in the preceding year. Popular remedies were cod liver oil, garlic, aloe vera, cranberry, echinacea, primrose oil, herbal vitamin supplement, and St. John's wort. Nonherbal therapies included massage, acupuncture, chiropractic, aromatherapy, reflexology, yoga, homeopathy, and osteopathy. Nine percent used CAM for their admission illness. Only 8% (15 of 177) found CAM ineffective. Only 76 of 177 (43%) had discussed their CAM use with their family doctor. CONCLUSION: Despite concerns over its safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness, the use of CAM is common among patients undergoing otolaryngologic and head and neck surgery. This has implications for all health care workers involved in their care, in particular the anesthetist and the surgeon. A detailed history of CAM use by patients should be taken and documented during the preoperative clerking.	Shakeel, Muhammad;Newton, Jonathan R;Ah-See, Kim Wong	2009 Jun
19476594	The enhancement of visuospatial processing efficiency through Buddhist Deity meditation.	This study examined the effects of meditation on mental imagery, evaluating Buddhist monks' reports concerning their extraordinary imagery skills. Practitioners of Buddhist meditation were divided into two groups according to their preferred meditation style: Deity Yoga (focused attention on an internal visual image) or Open Presence (evenly distributed attention, not directed to any particular object). Both groups of meditators completed computerized mental-imagery tasks before and after meditation. Their performance was compared with that of control groups, who either rested or performed other visuospatial tasks between testing sessions. The results indicate that all the groups performed at the same baseline level, but after meditation, Deity Yoga practitioners demonstrated a dramatic increase in performance on imagery tasks compared with the other groups. The results suggest that Deity meditation specifically trains one's capacity to access heightened visuospatial processing resources, rather than generally improving visuospatial imagery abilities.

19472865	Cerebrospinal fluid stasis and its clinical significance.	We hypothesize that stasis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) occurs commonly and is detrimental to health. Physiologic factors affecting the normal circulation of CSF include cardiovascular, respiratory, and vasomotor influences. The CSF maintains the electrolytic environment of the central nervous system (CNS), influences systemic acid-base balance, serves as a medium for the supply of nutrients to neuronal and glial cells, functions as a lymphatic system for the CNS by removing the waste products of cellular metabolism, and transports hormones, neurotransmitters, releasing factors, and other neuropeptides throughout the CNS. Physiologic impedance or cessation of CSF flow may occur commonly in the absence of degenerative changes or pathology and may compromise the normal physiologic functions of the CSF. CSF appears to be particularly prone to stasis within the spinal canal. CSF stasis may be associated with adverse mechanical cord tension, vertebral subluxation syndrome, reduced cranial rhythmic impulse, and restricted respiratory function. Increased sympathetic tone, facilitated spinal segments, dural tension, and decreased CSF flow have been described as closely related aspects of an overall pattern of structural and energetic dysfunction in the axial skeleton and CNS. Therapies directed at affecting CSF flow include osteopathic care (especially cranial manipulation), craniosacral therapy, chiropractic adjustment of the spine and cranium, Network Care (formerly Network Chiropractic), massage therapy (including lymphatic drainage techniques), yoga, therapeutic breath-work, and cerebrospinal fluid technique. Further investigation into the nature and causation of CSF stasis, its potential effects upon human health, and effective therapies for its correction is warranted.

19455911	Thunder among the pines: defining a pan-Asian soma.	Many ancient cultures and religions engaged in various techniques and used various substances to instigate religious experience and to alter perception. These techniques of psycho-sexual drug yoga reached an unparalleled level of sophistication that arose and was often cloaked in practical terms of alchemy and metallurgy. The Vedic tradition describes this plant-based ritualism as soma, which has been identified by Gordon Wasson as the mushroom Amanita muscaria. This article traces these soma-influenced sects of esoteric Buddhism that exerted influences from India, China and Tibet to Japan. Some of the key components, practices and symbolism are retained despite numerous cultural filters. Japan's tradition of esoteric Buddhism can thus be seen to have preserved and incorporated the soma/amrita mushroom lore into its own traditions of mountain ascetic mystics.

19450166	A survey of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) awareness among neurosurgeons in Washington State.	OBJECTIVES: Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by the U.S. population increased significantly in the past 2 decades. To maximize a patient's recovery from a neurosurgical procedure, it is critical that neurosurgeons be aware of the benefits and potential adverse complications of CAM therapies. The survey's purpose was to assess the current patterns of CAM utilization by neurosurgery patients and neurosurgeon knowledge of CAM therapies among Washington State Association of Neurological Surgeons (WSANS) members. METHODS: Members of the WSANS were surveyed in 2005. The survey was sent via e-mail and the data were anonymously collected using an online survey tool, Catalyst WebQ. RESULTS: The majority of responses (79%) stated that their neurosurgery practice was > or =75% adults. Acupuncture, herbs, massage therapy, prayer, and yoga were the most common CAM treatments patients used or discussed with their neurosurgeon. Fifty percent (50%) of neurosurgeons discussed the use of acupuncture among their colleagues. Concerning prayer and spirituality, 38% of the surveyed neurosurgeons stated that > or =25% of their patients have disclosed that they pray for their health; 42% stated that spirituality and prayer may affect neurosurgery outcome; and 38% stated that they pray for their patients. Overall, 63% of surveyed neurosurgeons stated that CAM treatments have a role in neurosurgery. CONCLUSIONS: The use of CAM may influence neurosurgical care; and the role of spirituality and prayer should be further explored. Because CAM utilization is ubiquitous, open discussion and familiarity with CAM treatments are becoming increasingly important in the field of neurosurgery.

19446710	Alternative mind-body therapies used by adults with medical conditions.	OBJECTIVE: Mind-body therapies (MBT) are used by 16.6% of adults in the United States. Little is known about the patterns of and reasons for use of MBT by adults with common medical conditions. METHODS: We analyzed data on MBT use from the 2002 National Health Interview Survey Alternative Medicine Supplement (n=31,044). MBT included relaxation techniques (deep breathing exercises, guided imagery, meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation), yoga, tai chi, and qigong. To identify medical conditions associated with use of MBT overall and of individual MBT, we used multivariable models adjusted for sociodemographic factors, insurance status, and health habits. Among users of MBT (n=5170), we assessed which medical conditions were most frequently treated with MBT, additional rationale for using MBT, and perceived helpfulness. RESULTS: We found a positive association between MBT use and several medical conditions including various pain syndromes and anxiety/depression. Among adults using MBT to treat specific medical conditions, MBT was most commonly used for anxiety/depression and musculoskeletal pain syndromes. More than 50% of respondents used MBT in conjunction with conventional medical care, and 20% used MBT for conditions they thought conventional medicine would not help. Overall, we found high rates (68-90%) of perceived helpfulness of MBT for specific medical conditions. DISCUSSION: MBT is commonly used by patients with prevalent medical conditions. Further research is needed to determine the reasons for widespread use of MBT for treatment of specific medical conditions and to evaluate the efficacy of MBT.

19445769	Epilepsy.	INTRODUCTION: About 3% of people will be diagnosed with epilepsy during their lifetime, but about 70% of people with epilepsy eventually go into remission. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the benefits and risks of starting anti-epileptic drug treatment following a single seizure? What are the effects of monotherapy in newly diagnosed partial epilepsy, and in newly diagnosed generalised epilepsy (tonic clonic type)? What are the effects of additional treatments in people with drug-resistant partial epilepsy? Which people in remission from seizures are at risk of relapse on withdrawal of drug treatment? What are the effects of behavioural and psychological treatments for people with epilepsy? What are the effects of surgery in people with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to April 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 59 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: addition of second-line drugs (gabapentin, levetiracetam, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, tiagabine, topiramate, vigabatrin, or zonisamide), amygdalohippocampectomy, anti-epileptic drug withdrawal for people in remission, anti-epileptic drugs after a single seizure, biofeedback, carbamazepine, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), educational programmes, family counselling, hemispherectomy, lesionectomy, phenobarbital, phenytoin, relaxation therapy (alone or plus behavioural modification therapy), sodium valproate, temporal lobectomy, topiramate, vagus nerve stimulation as adjunctive therapy for partial seizures, and yoga.

19436598	Informed decision making in maternity care.	In the United States, federal acts and regulations, as well as professional guidelines, clearly dictate that every pregnant woman has the right to base her maternity care decisions on accurate, up-to-date, comprehensible information. Despite these efforts, evidence suggests that informed consent within current health-care practice is restricted and inconsistently implemented. Patient access to evidence-based research is imperative under the scope of informed consent and is particularly important during a time when perinatal mortality and morbidity rates, interventions, and disparities are on the rise in the United States. This article describes the Coalition for Improving Maternity Services' investigation of the breakdown of informed consent in maternity care.	Goldberg, Holly	2009

19428013	Physical properties of the human head: mass, center of gravity and moment of inertia.	This paper presents a synthesis of biomedical investigations of the human head with specific reference to certain aspects of physical properties and development of anthropometry data, leading to the advancement of dummies used in crashworthiness research. As a significant majority of the studies have been summarized as reports, an effort has been made to chronologically review the literature with the above objectives. The first part is devoted to early studies wherein the mass, center of gravity (CG), and moment of inertia (MOI) properties are obtained from human cadaver experiments. Unembalmed and preserved whole-body and isolated head and head-neck experiments are discussed. Acknowledging that the current version of the Hybrid III dummy is the most widely used anthropomorphic test device in motor vehicle crashworthiness research for frontal impact applications for over 30 years, bases for the mass and MOI-related data used in the dummy are discussed. Since the development and federalization of the dummy in the United States, description of methods used to arrive at these properties form a part of the manuscript. Studies subsequent to the development of this dummy including those from the US Military are also discussed. As the head and neck are coupled in any impact, and increasing improvements in technology such as advanced airbags, and pre-tensioners and load limiters in manual seatbelts affect the kinetics of the head-neck complex, the manuscript underscores the need to pursue studies to precisely determine all the physical properties of the head. Because the most critical parameters (locations of CG and occipital condyles (OC), mass, and MOI) have not been determined on a specimen-by-specimen basis in any single study, it is important to gather these data in future experiments. These critical data will be of value for improving occupant safety, designing advanced restraint systems, developing second generation dummies, and assessing the injury mitigating characteristics of modern vehicle components in all impact modalities.

19420409	[Spontanous pneumomediastinum after yoga practice - a case report].	Pneumomediastinum is defined as interstitial air in the mediastinum, without any apparent precipating factor such as trauma, oesophageal perforation or infections. It is very uncommon and usually affects young otherwise healthy individuals. The most common symtoms are chest pain and dyspnea with subcutaneous emphysema found on examination. Treatment is usually conservative with pain relief. Here, we present an unusual case of a 23-year-old previously healthy male who was diagnosed with pneumomediastinum after practising yoga. This case demonstrates the need to study patients with chest pain of unknown cause in details to find causes.	Hafberg, Einar;Gudmundsson, Gunnar;Gudbjartsson, Tomas	2009 Apr

19383065	Perceptions and attitudes of rehabilitation medicine physicians on complementary and alternative medicine in Australia.	BACKGROUND: The growing demand for complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is undeniable. We report a first study about the attitudes and behaviour of Australian rehabilitation physicians to CAM. METHODS: A prospective cross-sectional survey was undertaken to document the prevalence of, knowledge about and referrals to CAM therapies and their perceived effectiveness, by a sample of Australian rehabilitation physicians. RESULTS: Thirty-six out of 94 actively practising rehabilitation physicians from the Australasian Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, replied to the survey, a response rate of 38%, and 85% reported familiarity with CAM, the most familiar therapies being acupuncture (80%), yoga (74%) and Tai-Chi (72%). CAM referral was reported in 84%, 38% personally used CAM, 94% of patients enquired about CAM therapies, 32% of respondents routinely enquired about CAM use. Age, sex and year of Fellowship were not associated with familiarity, personal use or frequency of patient enquiry about CAM. Those who reported to be very familiar with CAM were more likely to routinely enquire about CAM use (P = 0.028) and be more confident in prescribing certain CAM therapies (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Australian rehabilitation physicians report similar CAM referral rates to Canadian physiatrists and Australian general practitioners. The most commonly prescribed therapies were acupuncture, yoga and Tai-Chi. Almost all patients use CAM therapies, but only a minority of rehabilitation physicians enquires about CAM use on a regular basis. The latter may avoid potentially harmful drug interactions, as well as improve the quality of the physician-patient relationship.	Mak, J C S;Mak, L Y H;Shen, Q;Faux, S	2009 Mar
19361005	Complementary and alternative medicine use among adults and children: United States, 2007.	OBJECTIVE: This report presents selected estimates of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among U.S. adults and children, using data from the 2007 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Trends in adult use were assessed by comparing data from the 2007 and 2002 NHIS. METHODS: Estimates were derived from the Complementary and Alternative Medicine supplements and Core components of the 2007 and 2002 NHIS. Estimates were generated and comparisons conducted using the SUDAAN statistical package to account for the complex sample design. RESULTS: In 2007, almost 4 out of 10 adults had used CAM therapy in the past 12 months, with the most commonly used therapies being nonvitamin, nonmineral, natural products (17.7%) and deep breathing exercises (12.7%). American Indian or Alaska Native adults (50.3%) and white adults (43.1%) were more likely to use CAM than Asian adults (39.9%) or black adults (25.5%). Results from the 2007 NHIS found that approximately one in nine children (11.8%) used CAM therapy in the past 12 months, with the most commonly used therapies being nonvitamin, nonmineral, natural products (3.9%) and chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation (2.8%). Children whose parent used CAM were almost five times as likely (23.9%) to use CAM as children whose parent did not use CAM (5.1%). For both adults and children in 2007, when worry about cost delayed receipt of conventional care, individuals were more likely to use CAM than when the cost of conventional care was not a worry. Between 2002 and 2007 increased use was seen among adults for acupuncture, deep breathing exercises, massage therapy, meditation, naturopathy, and yoga. CAM use for head or chest colds showed a marked decrease from 2002 to 2007 (9.5% to 2.0%).	Barnes, Patricia M;Bloom, Barbara;Nahin, Richard L	2008 Dec 10
19352398	Integrative medicine: complementary therapies and supplements.	Many patients with cancer or other urologic disorders use complementary therapies in an effort to control symptoms and to prevent and treat disease. Complementary modalities are adjuncts to mainstream treatment. These safe, evidence-based therapies reduce symptoms associated with treatment of urologic cancers and other illnesses. They are to be distinguished from 'alternative therapies', which are unproven, potentially harmful, and often promoted as substitutes for mainstream medical care. Accumulating evidence supports the beneficial impact of complementary therapies, such as acupuncture, yoga, meditation and physical activity, on physical and emotional symptoms associated with cancer treatment, for which there are few effective standard interventions. Herbs and other dietary supplements are unlikely to be beneficial, and might be problematic or dangerous when taken during cancer treatment.

19341991	Ashtanga yoga for children and adolescents for weight management and psychological well being: an uncontrolled open pilot study.	OBJECTIVE: The objective of this pilot study was to determine the effect of yoga on weight in youth at risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Secondarily, the impact of participation in yoga on self-concept and psychiatric symptoms was measured. METHODS: A 12-week prospective pilot Ashtanga yoga program enrolled twenty children and adolescents. Weight was measured before and after the program. All participants completed self-concept, anxiety, and depression inventories at the initiation and completion of the program. RESULTS: Fourteen predominately Hispanic children, ages 8-15, completed the program. The average weight loss was 2kg. Weight decreased from 61.2+/-20.2kg to 59.2+/-19.2kg (p=0.01). Four of five children with low self-esteem improved, although two had decreases in self-esteem. Anxiety symptoms improved in the study. CONCLUSION: Ashtanga yoga may be beneficial as a weight loss strategy in a predominately Hispanic population.	Benavides, Sandra;Caballero, Joshua	2009 May
19341989	Effects of yoga on depression and anxiety of women.	UNLABELLED: Yoga has often been perceived as a method of stress management tool that can assist in alleviating depression and anxiety disorders. This study sought to evaluate the influence of yoga in relieving symptoms of depression and anxiety in women who were referred to a yoga clinic. METHODS: The study involved a convenience sample of women who were referred to a yoga clinic from July 2006 to July 2007. All new cases were evaluated on admission using a personal information questionnaire well as Beck and Spielberger tests. Participants were randomly assigned into an experimental and a control group. The experimental group (n=34) participated in twice weekly yoga classes of 90 min duration for two months. The control group (n=31) was assigned to a waiting list and did not receive yoga. Both groups were evaluated again after the two-month study period. RESULTS: The average prevalence of depression in the experimental group pre and post Yoga intervention was 12.82+/-7.9 and 10.79+/-6.04 respectively, a statistically insignificant decrease (p=0.13). However, when the experimental group was compared to the control group, women who participated in yoga classes showed a significant decrease in state anxiety (p=0.03) and trait anxiety (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Participation in a two-month yoga class can lead to significant reduction in perceived levels of anxiety in women who suffer from anxiety disorders. This study suggests that yoga can be considered as a complementary therapy or an alternative method for medical therapy in the treatment of anxiety disorders.

19320319	Insulin sensitivity and cardiac autonomic function in young male practitioners of yoga.	BACKGROUND: While yoga is thought to reduce the risk of chronic non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, there are no studies on insulin sensitivity in long term practitioners of yoga. We assessed insulin sensitivity and cardiac autonomic function in long term practitioners of yoga. METHODS: Fifteen healthy, young, male practitioners of yoga were compared with 15 young, healthy males who did not practice yoga matched for body-mass index. Fasting insulin sensitivity was measured in the fasting state by the hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups in their anthropometry or body composition. However, the fasting plasma insulin was significantly lower in the yoga group. The yoga group was also more insulin sensitive (yoga 7.82 [2.29] v. control 4.86 [11.97] (mg/[kg.min])/(microU/ml), p < 0.001). While the body weight and waist circumference were negatively correlated with glucose disposal rate in the controls, there were no similar correlations in the yoga group. The yoga group had significantly higher low-frequency power and lower normalized high-frequency power. CONCLUSION: Long term yoga practice (for 1 year or more) is associated with increased insulin sensitivity and attenuates the negative relationship between body weight or waist circumference and insulin sensitivity.

19319803	[The effect of yoga exercise intervention on health related physical fitness in school-age asthmatic children].	The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of yoga exercise on the health-related physical fitness of school-age children with asthma. The study employed a quasi-experimental research design in which 31 voluntary children (exercise group 16; control group15) aged 7 to 12 years were purposively sampled from one public elementary school in Taipei County. The yoga exercise program was practiced by the exercise group three times per week for a consecutive 7 week period. Each 60-minute yoga session included 10 minutes of warm-up and breathing exercises, 40 minutes of yoga postures, and 10 minutes of cool down exercises. Fitness scores were assessed at pre-exercise (baseline) and at the seventh and ninth week after intervention completion. A total of 30 subjects (exercise group 16; control group 14) completed follow-up. Results included: 1. Compared with children in the general population, the study subjects (n = 30) all fell below the 50th percentile in all five physical fitness items of interest. There was no significant difference in scores between the two groups at baseline (i.e., pre-exercise) for all five fitness items. 2. Research found a positive association between exercise habit after school and muscular strength and endurance among asthmatic children. 3. Compared to the control group, the exercise group showed favorable outcomes in terms of flexibility and muscular endurance. Such favorable outcomes remained evident even after adjusting for age, duration of disease and steroid use, values for which were unequally distributed between the two groups at baseline. 4. There was a tendency for all item-specific fitness scores to increase over time in the exercise group. The GEE analysis showed that yoga exercise indeed improved BMI, flexibility, and muscular endurance. After 2 weeks of self-practice at home, yoga exercise continued to improve BMI, flexibility, muscular strength, and cardiopulmonary fitness.

19305239	Efficacy and tolerability of yoga breathing in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a pilot study.	PURPOSE: Yoga-derived breathing has been reported to improve gas exchange in patients with chronic heart failure and in participants exposed to high-altitude hypoxia. We investigated the tolerability and effect of yoga breathing on ventilatory pattern and oxygenation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: Patients with COPD (N = 11, 3 women) without previous yoga practice and taking only short-acting beta2-adrenergic blocking drugs were enrolled. Ventilatory pattern and oxygen saturation were monitored by means of inductive plethysmography during 30-minute spontaneous breathing at rest (sb) and during a 30-minute yoga lesson (y). During the yoga lesson, the patients were requested to mobilize in sequence the diaphragm, lower chest, and upper chest adopting a slower and deeper breathing. We evaluated oxygen saturation (SaO2%), tidal volume (VT), minute ventilation (E), respiratory rate (i>f), inspiratory time, total breath time, fractional inspiratory time, an index of thoracoabdominal coordination, and an index of rapid shallow breathing. Changes in dyspnea during the yoga lesson were assessed with the Borg scale. RESULTS: During the yoga lesson, data showed the adoption of a deeper and slower breathing pattern (VTsb L 0.54[0.04], VTy L 0.74[0.08], P = .01; i>fsb 20.8[1.3], i>fy 13.8[0.2], P = .001) and a significant improvement in SaO2% with no change in E (SaO2%sb 91.5%[1.13], SaO2%y 93.5%[0.99], P = .02; Esb L/min 11.2[1.1], Ey L/min 10.2[0.9]). All the participants reported to be comfortable during the yoga lesson, with no increase in dyspnea index. CONCLUSION: We conclude that short-term training in yoga is well tolerated and induces favorable respiratory changes in patients with COPD.

19285813	Exercise to reduce vasomotor and other menopausal symptoms: a review.	Many women are reluctant to consider HRT as a therapeutic option for menopausal symptoms and are keen to use non-pharmacological treatments. Evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) concerning the effects of aerobic exercise on vasomotor and other menopausal symptoms is limited but what evidence we do have suggests that aerobic exercise can improve psychological health and quality of life in vasomotor symptomatic women. In addition, several RCTs of middle-aged/menopausal-aged women have found that aerobic exercise can invoke significant improvements in several common menopause-related symptoms (e.g. mood, health-related QoL and insomnia), relative to non-exercise comparison groups. There is some evidence that alternative forms of low intensity exercise such as yoga are beneficial in reducing vasomotor symptoms and improving psychological well-being in menopausal women. Collectively, these RCTs highlight the broader potential that exercise could have for women during the menopause transition. Whilst both the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the UK and the North American Menopause Society have recommended that women be advised to consider aerobic exercise as a treatment for vasomotor menopausal symptoms, to make any evidence-based conclusions regarding the effectiveness of exercise in managing these symptoms, more high quality research is needed.

19271174	Yoga and physiotherapy: a speculative review and conceptual synthesis.	This article presents the potential integration of yoga and physiotherapy when considering the essence of their underlying concepts. Within the scope of this article the existence of several similarities between these two 'concepts' has been suggested. Researchers, physiotherapists and their patients as well as yoga practitioners can obtain valuable and additional arguments through the cross-fertilization of ideas across presented studies united by shared, underlying concepts. The practice of yoga is based on the following assumptions: complexity and multidimensionality, various positive influences on an individual's wholeness through the mind, body, and the relationships between them. These assumptions may have the potential to contribute towards the practice of physiotherapy and its underlying principles. The essence of physiotherapy as a multifaceted process requires teamwork and efforts of various specialists like psychologists, sociologists, occupational therapists and nurses if patients are to benefit. Ideally, the physiotherapist should possess knowledge from these areas of science in order to professionally care about patients. Therefore, it can be suggested that basic similarities exist between yoga and physiotherapy in terms of mutidisciplinarity and complexity of holistic care. Such conceptual enrichment may be a useful source of inspiration for physiotherapists concerned about their patients' overall health on a daily basis. The authors emphasize the usefulness of yoga practice in clinical units and explain how the essence of Ayurvedic knowledge might be extrapolated and incorporated into theoretical principles of physiotherapy process. The justification of the studies included is also presented.	Posadzki, Paul;Parekh, Sheetal	2009 Feb
19262243	Pediatric oncologists' views toward the use of complementary and alternative medicine in children with cancer.	BACKGROUND: Pediatric oncology patients commonly use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), yet approximately only 50% of these patients discuss CAM with their oncologist. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to assess barriers to CAM communication in pediatric oncology. DESIGN/METHODS: A 33-question survey was sent via electronic mail to 358 pediatric oncologists in the United States. RESULTS: Ninety pediatric oncologists completed the survey. Ninety-nine percent of pediatric oncologists think it is important to know what CAM therapies their patients use. However, less than half of pediatric oncologists routinely ask their patients about CAM. This is primarily because of a lack of time and knowledge. Many physicians think some forms of CAM may improve quality of life, such as massage (74%) and yoga (57%). Over half of physicians thought that dietary supplements, herbal medicine, special diets, vitamins, and chiropractic might be harmful to patients. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric oncologists believe it is important to know which CAM therapies their patients use; however, they are not asking about them owing to lack of time and knowledge. To improve communication about CAM, increased physician education is needed. In addition, physicians should identify patients using potentially harmful CAM therapies. Furthermore, CAM research in pediatric oncology should focus on those modalities physicians believe may improve patient quality of life.	Roth, Michael;Lin, Juan;Kim, Mimi;Moody, Karen	2009 Mar
19254503	Use of a patient-controlled stretching device to improve the ankle range of motion.	BACKGROUND: Ankle and subtalar stiffness are widely associated with many foot and ankle conditions and functional deficits. Loss of range of motion, particularly dorsiflexion, results in significant gait dysfunction. A variety of methods have been evaluated to address this problem, including yoga, manipulation, dance training, jogging and static stretching exercises. No tools have been described that effectively and efficiently stretch the ankle and subtalar joint without requiring supervision or assistance of a trained physical therapist. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two subjects with varying foot and ankle diagnoses who had little or no improvement in range of motion after traditional assisted physical therapy were recruited from a foot and ankle orthopaedic clinic. The subjects' ankle and subtalar range of motion (ROM) in plantarflexion (PF), dorsiflexion (DF), inversion (INV), and eversion (EVR) were measured using a standard goniometer by a single physiotherapist prior to using the stretching device. The subjects were trained on the proper use of the stretching device and then instructed to use it daily for a 6-week period. Then the same examiner repeated the above measurements. Statistical analysis was performed using a two sample t-test assuming unequal variances. RESULTS: There were statistically significant increases in ROM in all planes tested: DF to PF (p = 0.0052), and INV to EVR (p = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Stretching with the device significantly increased ankle and subtalar ROM. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The stretching device can be used at home on a regular basis with minimal training and can effectively treat stiffness of the ankle and subtalar joints. It can be cost-effective when compared to use of physiotherapy services.	Trevino, Saul G;Buford, William L;Vallurupalli, Santaram;Rowell, Margaret;Panchbhavi, Vinod K	2009 Feb
19249998	Yoga therapy decreases dyspnea-related distress and improves functional performance in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a pilot study.	BACKGROUND: There has been limited study of yoga training as a complementary exercise strategy to manage the symptom of dyspnea in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). PURPOSE: The primary purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate a yoga program for its safety, feasibility, and efficacy for decreasing dyspnea intensity (DI) and dyspnea-related distress (DD) in older adults with COPD. METHODS: Clinically stable patients with COPD (n = 29; age 69.9 +/- 9.5; forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) 47.7 +/- 15.6% predicted; female = 21) were randomized to a 12-week yoga program specifically designed for people with COPD or usual-care control (UC). The twice-weekly yoga program included asanas (yoga postures) and visama vritti pranayama (timed breathing). Safety measure outcomes included heart rate, oxygen saturation, dyspnea, and pain. Feasibility was measured by patient-reported enjoyment, difficulty, and adherence to yoga sessions. At baseline and at 12 weeks, DI and DD were measured during incremental cycle ergometry and a 6-minute walk (6MW) test. Secondary efficacy outcomes included physical performance, psychologic well-being, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). RESULTS: Yoga training was safe and feasible for patients with COPD. While yoga training had only small effects on DI after the 6MW test (effect size [ES], 0.20; p = 0.60), there were greater reductions in DD in the yoga group compared to UC (ES, 0.67; p = 0.08). Yoga training also improved 6MW distance (+71.7 +/- 21.8 feet versus -27.6 +/- 36.2 feet; ES = 0.78, p = 0.04) and self-reported functional performance (ES = 0.79, p = 0.04) compared to UC. There were small positive changes in muscle strength and HRQoL. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with COPD participated safely in a 12-week yoga program especially designed for patients with this chronic illness. After the program, the subjects tolerated more activity with less DD and improved their functional performance. These findings need to be confirmed in a larger, more sufficiently powered efficacy study.	Donesky-Cuenco, DorAnne;Nguyen, Huong Q;Paul, Steven;Carrieri-Kohlman, Virginia	2009 Mar
19249921	Immediate effect of slow pace bhastrika pranayama on blood pressure and heart rate.	OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the immediate effect of slow pace bhastrika pranayama (respiratory rate 6/min) for 5 minutes on heart rate and blood pressure and the effect of the same breathing exercise for the same duration of time (5 minutes) following oral intake of hyoscine-N-butylbromide (Buscopan), a parasympathetic blocker drug. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Heart rate and blood pressure of volunteers (n = 39, age = 25-40 years) was recorded following standard procedure. First, subjects had to sit comfortably in an easy and steady posture (sukhasana) on a fairly soft seat placed on the floor keeping head, neck, and trunk erect, eyes closed, and the other muscles reasonably loose. The subject is directed to inhale through both nostrils slowly up to the maximum for about 4 seconds and then exhale slowly up to the maximum through both nostrils for about 6 seconds. The breathing must not be abdominal. These steps complete one cycle of slow pace bhastrika pranayama (respiratory rate 6/min). During the practice the subject is asked not to think much about the inhalation and exhalation time, but rather was requested to imagine the open blue sky. The pranayama was conducted in a cool, well-ventilated room (18-20 degrees C). After 5 minutes of this breathing practice, the blood pressure and heart rate again were recorded in the aforesaid manner using the same instrument. The other group (n = 10) took part in another study where their blood pressure and heart rate were recorded following half an hour of oral intake of hyoscine-N-butylbromide 20 mg. Then they practiced the breathing exercise as stated above, and the abovementioned parameters were recorded again to study the effect of parasympathetic blockade on the same pranayama. RESULTS: It was noted that after slow bhastrika pranayamic breathing (respiratory rate 6/min) for 5 minutes, both the systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly with a slight fall in heart rate. No significant alteration in both blood pressure and heart rate was observed in volunteers who performed the same breathing exercise for the same duration following oral intake of hyoscine-N-butylbromide. DISCUSSION: Pranayama increases frequency and duration of inhibitory neural impulses by activating pulmonary stretch receptors during above tidal volume inhalation as in Hering Bruer reflex, which bring about withdrawal of sympathetic tone in the skeletal muscle blood vessels, leading to widespread vasodilatation, thus causing decrease in peripheral resistance and thus decreasing the diastolic blood pressure. After hyoscine-N-butylbromide, the parasympathetic blocker, it was observed that blood pressure was not decreased significantly as a result of pranayama, as it was observed when no drug was administered. CONCLUSIONS: Vagal cardiac and pulmonary mechanisms are linked, and improvement in one vagal limb might spill over into the other. Baroreceptor sensitivity can be enhanced significantly by slow breathing (supported by a small reduction in the heart rate observed during slow breathing and by reduction in both systolic and diastolic pressure). Slow pace bhastrika pranayama (respiratory rate 6/min) exercise thus shows a strong tendency to improving the autonomic nervous system through enhanced activation of the parasympathetic system.

23051013	Yoga in the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders: A review.	BACKGROUND: Patient use of complementary and alternative treatments, including yoga, to manage mood and anxiety disorders, has been well documented. Despite research interest, there are few recent reviews of the evidence of the benefit of yoga in these conditions. METHOD: The PubMed, Medline and PsycInfo databases were searched for literature published up to July 2008, relating to yoga and depressive and anxiety disorders. RESULTS: The paucity of reported studies and several methodological constraints limit data interpretation. In depressive disorders, yoga may be comparable to medication and the combination superior to medication alone. There is reasonable evidence for its use as second-line monotherapy or augmentation to medication in mild to moderate major depression and dysthymia, with early evidence of benefit in more severe depression. In anxiety disorders, yoga may be superior to medication for a subgroup of patients, but its benefits in specific conditions are still largely unknown. Second-line monotherapy is indicated in performance or test anxiety, but only preliminary evidence exists for obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Yoga appears to be superior to no treatment and progressive relaxation for both depression and anxiety, and may benefit mood and anxiety symptoms associated with medical illness. It shows good safety and tolerability in short-term treatment. CONCLUSION: Reasonable evidence supports the benefit of yoga in specific depressive disorders. The evidence is still preliminary in anxiety disorders. Given its patient appeal and the promising findings thus far, further research on yoga in these conditions is encouraged.	da Silva, Tricia L;Ravindran, Lakshmi N;Ravindran, Arun V	2009 Mar
19246136	Effects of a prenatal yoga programme on the discomforts of pregnancy and maternal childbirth self-efficacy in Taiwan.	OBJECTIVE: to evaluate a yoga programme provided to primigravidas in the third trimester of pregnancy with the aim of decreasing the discomforts associated with pregnancy and increasing childbirth self-efficacy. DESIGN: non-randomised controlled experimental study. SETTING: a hospital in northern Taiwan. PARTICIPANTS: the target population was primigravidas at 26-28 weeks of gestation (no high-risk pregnancies) who had not engaged in regular exercise or yoga for at least one year. The study included 88 individuals; 43 in the control group and 45 in the experimental group who took part in the prenatal yoga programme. INTERVENTION: the duration of the prenatal yoga programme was 12-14 weeks, with at least three sessions per week. Each workout lasted for 30 minutes. MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: women who took part in the prenatal yoga programme reported significantly fewer pregnancy discomforts than the control group (38.28 vs 43.26, z=-2.58, p=0.01) at 38-40 weeks of gestation. The subjects who participated in the yoga programme exhibited higher outcome and self-efficacy expectancies during the active stage of labour (104.13 vs 83.53, t=3.24, p=0.002; 99.26 vs 77.70, t=3.99, p </= 0.001) and the second stage of labour (113.33 vs 88.42, t=3.33, p=0.002; 102.19 vs 79.40, t=3.71, p </= 0.001) compared with the control group. KEY CONCLUSIONS: the provision of booklets and videos on yoga during pregnancy may contribute to a reduction in pregnancy discomforts and improved childbirth self-efficacy. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: this yoga programme provides health-care professionals with an evidence-based intervention.	Sun, Yi-Chin;Hung, Ya-Chi;Chang, Yuanmay;Kuo, Su-Chen	2010 Dec
19243275	A nonrandomized non-naive comparative study of the effects of kapalabhati and breath awareness on event-related potentials in trained yoga practitioners.	OBJECTIVES: The study was conducted to compare the P300 event-related potentials recorded before and after (1) high-frequency yoga breathing (HFYB) and (2) breath awareness. DESIGN: The P300 was recorded in participants of two groups before and after the intervention session (1 minute in duration). SETTINGS AND LOCATION: All participants were receiving yoga training in a residential yoga center, Swami Vivekanada Yoga Research Foundation in Bangalore, India. SUBJECTS: Thirty (30) male participants formed two groups (n = 15 each) with comparable ages (within an age range of 20-35 years) and comparable experience of the two techniques, the minimum experience being 3 months. INTERVENTIONS: The two groups were each given a separate intervention. One group practiced a HFYB at a frequency of approximately 2.0 Hz, called kapalabhati. The other group practiced breath awareness during which participants were aware of their breath while seated, relaxed. OUTCOME MEASURES: The P300 event-related potential, which is generated when attending to and discriminating between auditory stimuli, was recorded before and after both techniques. RESULTS: The P300 peak latency decreased after HFYB and the P300 peak amplitude increased after breath awareness. CONCLUSIONS: Both practices (HFYB and Breath awareness), though very different, influenced the P300. HFYB reduced the peak latency, suggesting a decrease in time needed for this task, which requires selective attention. Breath awareness increased the P300 peak amplitude, suggesting an increase in the neural resources available for the task.	Joshi, Meesha;Telles, Shirley	2009 Mar
19242916	Restorative yoga for women with breast cancer: findings from a randomized pilot study.	OBJECTIVES: Restorative yoga (RY) is a gentle type of yoga that may be beneficial for cancer patients and post-treatment survivors. Study goals were: to determine the feasibility of implementing a RY intervention for women with breast cancer; and to examine group differences in self-reported emotional, health-related quality of life, and symptom outcomes. METHODS: Women with breast cancer (n=44; mean age 55.8 years) enrolled in this study; 34% were actively undergoing cancer treatment. Study participants were randomized to the intervention (10 weekly 75-minute RY classes) or a waitlist control group. Participants completed questionnaires at Week 0 (baseline) and Week 10 (immediately post-intervention for the yoga group). RESULTS: Group differences favoring the yoga group were seen for mental health, depression, positive affect, and spirituality (peace/meaning). Significant baseline*group interactions were observed for negative affect and emotional well-being. Women with higher negative affect and lower emotional well-being at baseline derived greater benefit from the yoga intervention compared to those with similar values at baseline in the control group. The yoga group demonstrated a significant within-group improvement in fatigue; no significant difference was noted for the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Although limited by sample size, these pilot data suggest potential benefit of RY on emotional outcomes and fatigue in cancer patients. This study demonstrates that a RY intervention is feasible for women with breast cancer; implications for study design and implementation are noted with an emphasis on program adoption and participant adherence.

19242842	Yoga as an intervention in the treatment of eating disorders: does it help?	This article explores the uses of yoga as an experiential adjunct to other forms of therapy in the treatment of eating disorders in residential and outpatient settings. Supported by other treatment modalities, yoga can be an effective method for increasing self-awareness, reflection and the ability to self-soothe. Like other interventions, yoga has potential misuses. These misuses are uncovered with suggestions made as to how therapists can support the practice of yoga in residential and outpatient settings.

19228402	Community based yoga classes for type 2 diabetes: an exploratory randomised controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Yoga is a popular therapy for diabetes but its efficacy is contested. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility of researching community based yoga classes in Type 2 diabetes with a view to informing the design of a definitive, multi-centre trial METHODS: The study design was an exploratory randomised controlled trial with in-depth process evaluation. The setting was two multi-ethnic boroughs in London, UK; one with average and one with low mean socio-economic deprivation score. Classes were held at a sports centre or GP surgery. Participants were 59 people with Type 2 diabetes not taking insulin, recruited from general practice lists or opportunistically by general practice staff. The intervention group were offered 12 weeks of a twice-weekly 90-minute yoga class; the control group was a waiting list for the yoga classes. Both groups received advice and leaflets on healthy lifestyle and were encouraged to exercise. Primary outcome measure was HbA1c. Secondary outcome measures included attendance, weight, waist circumference, lipid levels, blood pressure, UKPDS cardiovascular risk score, diabetes-related quality of life (ADDQoL), and self-efficacy. Process measures were attendance at yoga sessions, self-reported frequency of practice between taught sessions, and qualitative data (interviews with patients and therapists, ethnographic observation of the yoga classes, and analysis of documents including minutes of meetings, correspondence, and exercise plans). RESULTS: Despite broad inclusion criteria, around two-thirds of the patients on GP diabetic registers proved ineligible, and 90% of the remainder declined to participate. Mean age of participants was 60 +/- 10 years. Attendance at yoga classes was around 50%. Nobody did the exercises regularly at home. Yoga teachers felt that most participants were unsuitable for 'standard' yoga exercises because of limited flexibility, lack of basic fitness, co-morbidity, and lack of confidence. There was a small fall in HbA1c in the yoga group which was not statistically significant and which was not sustained six months later, and no significant change in other outcome measures. CONCLUSION: The benefits of yoga in type 2 diabetes suggested in some previous studies were not confirmed. Possible explanations (apart from lack of efficacy) include recruitment challenges; practical and motivational barriers to class attendance; physical and motivational barriers to engaging in the exercises; inadequate intensity and/or duration of yoga intervention; and insufficient personalisation of exercises to individual needs. All these factors should be considered when designing future trials. TRIAL REGISTRATION: National Research Register (1410) and Current Controlled Trials (ISRCTN63637211).

19221071	Complementary and alternative medicine for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.	OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence supporting selected complementary and alternative medicine approaches used in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: MEDLINE (from January 1966), EMBASE (from January 1980), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched until March 2008, combining the terms irritable bowel syndrome or irritable colon with complementary therapies, alternative medicine, acupuncture, fiber, peppermint oil, herbal, traditional, yoga, massage, meditation, mind, relaxation, probiotic, hypnotherapy, psychotherapy, cognitive therapy, or behavior therapy. Results were screened to include only clinical trials, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Level I evidence was available for most interventions. MAIN MESSAGE: Soluble fibre improves constipation and global IBS symptoms. Peppermint oil alleviates IBS symptoms, including abdominal pain. Probiotic trials show overall benefit for IBS but there is little evidence supporting the use of any specific strain. Hypnotherapy and cognitive-behavioural therapy are also effective therapeutic options for appropriate patients. Certain herbal formulas are supported by limited evidence, but safety is a potential concern. All interventions are supported by systematic reviews or meta-analyses. CONCLUSION: Several complementary and alternative therapies can be recommended as part of an evidence-based approach to the treatment of IBS; these might provide patients with satisfactory relief and improve the therapeutic alliance.

19214878	Neck forces and moments and head accelerations in side impact.	OBJECTIVES: Although side-impact sled studies have investigated chest, abdomen, and pelvic injury mechanics, determination of head accelerations and the associated neck forces and moments is very limited. The purpose of the present study was therefore to determine the temporal forces and moments at the upper neck region and head angular accelerations and angular velocities using postmortem human subjects (PMHS). METHODS: Anthropometric data and X-rays were obtained, and the specimens were positioned upright on a custom-designed seat, rigidly fixed to the platform of the sled. PMHS were seated facing forward with the Frankfort plane horizontal, and legs were stretched parallel to the mid-sagittal plane. The normal curvature and alignment of the dorsal spine were maintained without initial torso rotation. A pyramid-shaped nine-accelerometer package was secured to the parietal-temporal region of the head. The test matrix consisted of groups A and B, representing the fully restrained torso condition, and groups C and D, representing the three-point belt-restrained torso condition. The change in velocity was 12.4 m/s for groups A and C, 17.9 m/s for group B, and 8.7 m/s for group D tests. Two specimens were tested in each group. Injuries were scored based on the Abbreviated Injury Scale. The head mass, center of gravity, and moment of inertia were determined for each specimen. Head accelerations and upper neck forces and moments were determined before head contact. RESULTS: Neck forces and moments and head angular accelerations and angular velocities are presented on a specimen-by-specimen basis. In addition, a summary of peak magnitudes of biomechanical data is provided because of their potential in serving as injury reference values characterizing head-neck biomechanics in side impacts. Though no skull fractures occurred, AIS 0 to 3 neck traumas were dependent on the impact velocity and restraint condition. CONCLUSIONS: Because specimen-specific head center of gravity and mass moment of inertia were determined, and a suitable instrumentation system was used for data collection and analysis, head angular accelerations and neck forces and moments determined in the present study can be used with confidence to advance impact biomechanics research. Although the sample size is limited in each group, results from these tests serve as a fundamental data set to validate finite element models and evaluate the performance and biofidelity of federalized and prototype side-impact dummies with a focus on head-neck biomechanics.

19214594	Yoga of Awareness program for menopausal symptoms in breast cancer survivors: results from a randomized trial.	GOAL OF WORK: Breast cancer survivors have limited options for the treatment of hot flashes and related symptoms. Further, therapies widely used to prevent recurrence in survivors, such as tamoxifen, tend to induce or exacerbate menopausal symptoms. The aim of this preliminary, randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the effects of a yoga intervention on menopausal symptoms in a sample of survivors of early-stage breast cancer (stages IA-IIB). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-seven disease-free women experiencing hot flashes were randomized to the 8-week Yoga of Awareness program (gentle yoga poses, meditation, and breathing exercises) or to wait-list control. The primary outcome was daily reports of hot flashes collected at baseline, posttreatment, and 3 months after treatment via an interactive telephone system. Data were analyzed by intention to treat. MAIN RESULTS: At posttreatment, women who received the yoga program showed significantly greater improvements relative to the control condition in hot-flash frequency, severity, and total scores and in levels of joint pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, symptom-related bother, and vigor. At 3 months follow-up, patients maintained their treatment gains in hot flashes, joint pain, fatigue, symptom-related bother, and vigor and showed additional significant gains in negative mood, relaxation, and acceptance. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study provides promising support for the beneficial effects of a comprehensive yoga program for hot flashes and other menopausal symptoms in early-stage breast cancer survivors.

19204502	Association of contact loading in diffuse axonal injuries from motor vehicle crashes.	BACKGROUND: Although studies have been conducted to analyze brain injuries from motor vehicle crashes, the association of head contact has not been fully established. This study examined the association in occupants sustaining diffuse axonal injuries (DAIs). METHODS: The 1997 to 2006 motor vehicle Crash Injury Research Engineering Network database was used. All crash modes and all changes in velocity were included; ejections and rollovers were excluded; injuries to front and rear seat occupants with and without restraint use were considered. DAI were coded in the database using Abbreviated Injury Scale 1990. Loss of consciousness was included and head contact was based on medical- and crash-related data. RESULTS: Sixty-seven occupants with varying ages were coded with DAI. Forty-one adult occupants (mean, 33 years of age, 171-cm tall, 71-kg weight; 30 drivers, 11 passengers) were analyzed. Mean change in velocity was 41.2 km/h and Glasgow Coma Scale score was 4. There were 33 lateral, 6 frontal, and 2 rear crashes with 32 survivors and 9 were fatalities. Two occupants in the same crash did not sustain DAI. Although skull fractures and scalp injuries occurred in some impacts, head contact was identified in all frontal, rear, and far side, and all but one nearside crashes. CONCLUSIONS: Using a large sample size of occupants sustaining DAI in 1991 to 2006 model year vehicles, DAI occurred more frequently in side than frontal crashes, is most commonly associated with impact load transfer, and is not always accompanied by skull fractures. The association of head contact in >95% of cases underscores the importance of evaluating crash-related variables and medical information for trauma analysis. It would be prudent to include contact loading in addition to angular kinematics in the analysis and characterization of DAI.

19202482	The spiritual and religious identities, beliefs, and practices of academic pediatricians in the United States.	PURPOSE: Physicians' spiritual and religious identities, beliefs, and practices are beginning to be explored. The objective of this study was to gather descriptive information about personal religion and spirituality from a random sample of academic American pediatricians and to compare this information with similar data from the public. METHOD: In 2005, a Web-based survey of a random sample of 208 pediatrician faculty from 13 academic centers ranked by the US News & World Report as "honor roll" hospitals was conducted. Surveys elicited information about personal beliefs and practices as well as their influence on decisions about patient care and clinical practice. Multiple questions were replicated from the General Social Survey to enable comparisons with the public. Descriptive statistics were generated, and logistic regression analyses were conducted on relevant variables. RESULTS: Nearly 88% of respondents were raised in a religious tradition, but just 67.2% claimed current religious identification. More than half (52.6%) reported praying privately; additional spiritual practices reported included relaxation techniques (38.8%), meditation (29.3%), sacred readings (26.7%), and yoga (19%). The majority of academic pediatricians (58.6%) believed that personal spiritual or religious beliefs influenced their interactions with patients/colleagues. These odds increased 5.1-fold when academic pediatricians attended religious services monthly or more (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the American public, a notably smaller proportion of academic pediatricians reported a personal religious identity. The majority believed spiritual and religious beliefs influenced their practice of pediatrics. Whether secular or faith-based belief systems measurably modify academic pediatric practice is unknown.

19190034	Effects of a yoga program on cortisol rhythm and mood states in early breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy: a randomized controlled trial.	UNLABELLED: Objectives. This study compares the effects of an integrated yoga program with brief supportive therapy in breast cancer outpatients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy at a cancer center. METHODS: Eighty-eight stage II and III breast cancer outpatients are randomly assigned to receive yoga (n = 44) or brief supportive therapy (n = 44) prior to radiotherapy treatment. Assessments include diurnal salivary cortisol levels 3 days before and after radiotherapy and self-ratings of anxiety, depression, and stress collected before and after 6 weeks of radiotherapy. RESULTS: Analysis of covariance reveals significant decreases in anxiety (P < .001), depression (P = .002), perceived stress (P < .001), 6 a.m. salivary cortisol (P = .009), and pooled mean cortisol (P = .03) in the yoga group compared with controls. There is a significant positive correlation between morning salivary cortisol level and anxiety and depression. CONCLUSION: Yoga might have a role in managing self-reported psychological distress and modulating circadian patterns of stress hormones in early breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy.

19184028	The benefits of yoga for rheumatoid arthritis: results of a preliminary, structured 8-week program.	The aim of this study was to measure the effects of a bi-weekly Raj yoga program on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity. Subjects were recruited from among RA patients in Dubai, United Arab Emirates by email invitations of the RA database. Demographic data, disease activity indices, health assessment questionnaire (HAQ), and quality of life (QOL) by SF-36 were documented at enrollment and after completion of 12 sessions of Raj yoga. A total of 47 patients were enrolled: 26 yoga and 21 controls. Baseline demographics were similar in both groups. Patients who underwent yoga had statistically significant improvements in DAS28 and HAQ, but not QOL. Our pilot study of 12 sessions of yoga for RA was able to demonstrate statistically significant improvements in RA disease parameters. We believe that a longer duration of treatment could result in more significant improvements.	Badsha, Humeira;Chhabra, Vishwas;Leibman, Cathy;Mofti, Ayman;Kong, Kok Ooi	2009 Oct
19182695	Discontinuing postmenopausal hormone therapy: an observational study of tapering versus quitting cold turkey: is there a difference in recurrence of menopausal symptoms?	OBJECTIVE: Because no current evidence-based guidelines for postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) discontinuation strategies exist, we compared female veterans who tapered HT to those who stopped abruptly with regard to patient-specific health factors and recurrence of menopausal symptoms. METHODS: We identified female veterans who used combined estrogen/medroxyprogesterone HT in 2001 using the VA Pharmacy Benefits Management database. We then randomly sorted and selected 4,000 women for a mailed invitation to participate in a HT survey. Women who agreed to participate were mailed the National Women Veterans Hormone Replacement Survey. RESULTS: Of 836 participants who discontinued HT, 75% stopped cold turkey and 25% tapered. In bivariate analysis, taperers were more likely to report higher incomes, less smoking, and more use of alternatives such as vitamin E, other dietary supplements, and exercise or yoga for menopausal symptoms. They also more frequently reported discussions of menopausal symptoms with providers and used HT for menopausal symptoms and had longer median years of HT (P <or= 0.05 for each comparison). In multivariate analysis, tapering was significantly associated with younger age (odds ratio [OR], 0.97; 95% CI, 0.94-0.99), initiating HT for menopausal symptoms (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.06-2.62), moderate (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.11-2.51) or prolonged (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 1.76-4.65) years of HT use, use of vitamin E (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.02-2.44), use of yoga (OR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.05-5.55), and higher income (OR for income <$20.000/y, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46-0.92). Separately, tapering HT was significantly associated with lower menopausal symptom scores after discontinuation (beta = -0.58 +/- 0.21, P = 0.01). However, tapering HT also had a significant association with resumption of hormones at a later date (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.20-3.52). CONCLUSIONS: Tapering HT may lessen recurrence of menopausal symptoms after discontinuation, but some women may remain inclined to return to HT. Separately, in the Department of Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, female veterans resuming HT need providers who can discuss HT options.

19169169	Yoga for menopausal symptoms: a systematic review.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of yoga as a treatment option for menopausal symptoms. METHODS: We searched the literature using 14 databases from their inception to July 2008 and included all types of clinical studies regardless of their design. The methodological quality of all studies was assessed using a modified Jadad score. RESULTS: Seven studies met our inclusion criteria. Two randomized clinical trials compared the effects of yoga with those of walking or physical exercise. The meta-analysis of these data failed to show specific effects of yoga on menopausal complaints including psychological, somatic, and vasomotor symptoms. Two randomized clinical trials found no effects of yoga on total menopausal symptoms compared with wait-list control or no treatment. The remaining studies were either non-randomized (n = 1) or uncontrolled clinical trials (n = 3). They reported favorable effects of yoga on menopausal symptoms. These data collectively show that the results of rigorous studies of the effects of yoga for menopausal symptoms are unconvincing. CONCLUSION: The evidence is insufficient to suggest that yoga is an effective intervention for menopause. Further research is required to investigate whether there are specific benefits of yoga for treating menopausal symptoms.

19169167	Physical activity, menopause, and quality of life: the role of affect and self-worth across time.	OBJECTIVE: Physical activity has been shown to enhance quality of life (QOL); however, few investigations of these effects exist in women undergoing the menopausal transition. The present study examined the long-term effects of physical activity on menopause-related QOL and tested the mediating effects of physical self-worth and positive affect in this relationship. METHODS: Middle-aged women previously enrolled in a 4-month randomized controlled trial involving walking and yoga, and a control group completed a follow-up mail-in survey 2 years after the end of the trial. The survey included a battery of psychological and physical activity measures, including measures of menopausal symptoms and menopause-related QOL. Longitudinal linear panel analysis was conducted within a covariance modeling framework to test whether physical self-worth and positive affect mediated the physical activity-QOL relationship over time. RESULTS: At the end of the trial, physical activity and menopausal symptoms were related to physical self-worth and positive affect, and in turn, greater levels of physical self-worth and positive affect were associated with higher levels of menopause-related QOL. Analyses indicated that increases in physical activity and decreases in menopausal symptoms over the 2-year period were related to increases in physical self-worth (betas = 0.23 and -0.52, physical activity and menopausal symptoms, respectively) and, for symptoms, also to decreased positive affect (beta = -0.47), and both physical self-worth (beta = 0.34) and affect (beta = 0.43) directly influenced enhancements in QOL (R = 0.775). CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the position that the effects of physical activity on QOL are mediated, in part, by intermediate psychological outcomes and that physical activity can have long-term benefits for women undergoing the menopausal transition.

19130866	Immediate effects of right and left nostril breathing on verbal and spatial scores.	The immediate effect of two yoga breathing techniques was assessed on verbal and spatial memory tasks, considered hemisphere-specific. Forty-five participants (24 males; age range 20 to 45 years (mean age 27.1 +/- 8.1 years) were randomly allocated to three groups (n = 15 each) and were assessed immediately before and after 45 minutes of three breathing practices i.e., right nostril yoga breathing, left nostril yoga breathing, or breath awareness as a control intervention. Spatial memory scores increased after left nostril yoga breathing compared to before (by 16 percent, P = 0.03, paired t-test). Hence, breathing through the left nostril increased performance in a spatial cognitive task, corresponding to the cerebral hemisphere contralateral to the patent nostril.

19130860	Effect of six weeks yoga training on weight loss following step test, respiratory pressures, handgrip strength and handgrip endurance in young healthy subjects.	The present study was designed to test whether yoga training of six weeks duration modulates sweating response to dynamic exercise and improves respiratory pressures, handgrip strength and handgrip endurance. Out of 46 healthy subjects (30 males and 16 females, aged 17-20 yr), 23 motivated subjects (15 male and 8 female) were given yoga training and the remaining 23 subjects served as controls. Weight loss following Harvard step test (an index of sweat loss), maximum inspiratory pressure, maximum expiratory pressure, 40 mm endurance, handgrip strength and handgrip endurance were determined before and after the six week study period. In the yoga group, weight loss in response to Harvard step test was 64 +/- 30 g after yoga training as compared to 161 +/- 133 g before the training and the difference was significant (n = 15 male subjects, P < 0.0001). In contrast, weight loss following step test was not significantly different in the control group at the end of the study period. Yoga training produced a marked increase in respiratory pressures and endurance in 40 mm Hg test in both male and female subjects (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). In conclusion, the present study demonstrates attenuation of the sweating response to step test by yoga training. Further, yoga training for a short period of six weeks can produce significant improvements in respiratory muscle strength and endurance.

19130855	Effect of yoga based lifestyle intervention on subjective well-being.	Yoga is assuming importance in improving mental health and quality of life in the treatment of a number of psychiatric and psychosomatic disorders. The present study was a prospective controlled study to explore the short-term impact of a comprehensive but brief lifestyle intervention, based on yoga, on subjective well being levels in normal and diseased subjects. Normal healthy individuals and subjects having hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus or a variety of other illnesses were included in the study. The outcome measures were 'subjective well being inventory' (SUBI) scores, taken on the first and last day of the course. The inventory consists of questions related to one's feelings and attitude about various areas of life, such as happiness, achievement and interpersonal relationship. There was significant improvement in the subjective well being scores of the 77 subjects within a period of 10 days as compared to controls. These observations suggest that a short lifestyle modification and stress management educational program leads to remarkable improvement in the subjective well being scores of the subjects and can therefore make an appreciable contribution to primary prevention as well as management of lifestyle diseases.

19126911	Isolated rupture of the lateral collateral ligament during yoga practice: a case report.	We report a case of isolated rupture of the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) of the knee while attempting to place the left foot behind the head during yoga practice. The 34-year-old man had discomfort of the lateral aspect of the knee particularly with varus strain. A magnetic resonance image revealed rupture of the LCL at the insertion onto the fibula. The patient had grade-II laxity of the LCL and was treated non-operatively. At the 12-month follow-up, grade-I laxity of the LCL remained clinically evident, but function was not impaired.

19123876	Commentary on the AHRQ report on research on meditation practices in health.	The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) report is a major reference point for establishing where the research on meditation stands and where it should go from here. This commentary argues that double blinding, a major component of the report's evaluation criteria, is not an appropriate control for placebo in meditation research. A viable alternative is to make the treatment and control groups equivalent on nonspecific therapeutic attention factors and expectation. High quality meditation research must also use qualified instructors, have high compliance levels, insure proficient practice, use state-of-the-art measurement methodology, and make sure control subjects are not inadvertently practicing the same or another form of meditation. None of these determinants of research quality was assessed by the AHRQ report. It is noteworthy that whereas randomized controlled trials have their place in demonstrating clinical efficacy, few if any of the major ideas in the basic or behavioral sciences have come from randomized trails. A wide range of study designs have demonstrated that the traditional goal of meditation, a state of inner silence called "transcendental consciousness," has unique physiological characteristics with far ranging implications for health, cognition, and behavior. Such studies need to be included in future reviews of meditation techniques.	Orme-Johnson, David W	2008 Dec
19123875	Clinical trials of meditation practices in health care: characteristics and quality.	OBJECTIVE: To provide a descriptive overview of the clinical trials assessing meditation practices for health care. DESIGN: Systematic review of the literature. Comprehensive searches were conducted in 17 electronic bibliographic databases through September 2005. Other sources of potentially relevant studies included hand searches, reference tracking, contacting experts, and gray literature searches. Included studies were clinical trials with 10 or more adult participants using any meditation practice, providing quantitative data on health-related outcomes, and published in English. Two independent reviewers assessed study relevance, extracted the data, and assessed the methodological quality of the studies. RESULTS: Four hundred clinical trials on meditation (72% described as randomized) were included in the review (publication years 1956-2005). Five broad categories of meditation practices were identified: mantra meditation, mindfulness meditation, yoga, t'ai chi, and qigong. The three most studied clinical conditions were hypertension, miscellaneous cardiovascular diseases, and substance abuse. Psychosocial measures were the most frequently reported outcomes. Outcome measures of psychiatric and psychological symptoms dominate the outcomes of interest. Overall, the methodological quality of clinical trials is poor, but has significantly improved over time by 0.014 points every year (95% CI, 0.005, 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: Most clinical trials on meditation practices are generally characterized by poor methodological quality with significant threats to validity in every major quality domain assessed. Despite a statistically significant improvement in the methodological quality over time, it is imperative that future trials on meditation be rigorous in design, execution, analysis, and the reporting of results.

19118798	Yoga techniques as a means of core stability training.	Core stability in general involves the muscular control required around the lumbar spine to maintain functional stability. Stability and movement are critically dependent on the coordination of all the muscles surrounding the lumbar spine. This paper aims to show that an age-old yoga practice, called Uddhyana Bhanda and Nouli, is an effective means of core stability.	Omkar, S N;Vishwas, S;Tech, B	2009 Jan
21234215	Effect of yoga on academic performance in relation to stress.	BACKGROUND: Academic performance is concerned with the quantity and quality of learning attained in a subject or group of subjects after a long period of instruction. Excessive stress hampers students' performance. Improvement in academic performance and alertness has been reported in several yogic studies. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The main objective of the study was to assess the effect of yoga on academic performance in relation to stress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study started with 800 adolescent students; 159 high-stress students and 142 low-stress students were selected on the basis of scores obtained through Stress Battery. Experimental group and control group were given pre test in three subjects, i.e., Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies. A yoga module consisting of yoga asanas, pranayama, meditation, and a value orientation program was administered on experimental group for 7 weeks. The experimental and control groups were post-tested for their performance on the three subjects mentioned above. RESULTS: The results show that the students, who practiced yoga performed better in academics. The study further shows that low-stress students performed better than high-stress students, meaning thereby that stress affects the students' performance.	Kauts, Amit;Sharma, Neelam	2009 Jan
21234214	Effect of yogic education system and modern education system on sustained attention.	BACKGROUND/AIM: Sustained attention is a vital function mediated by the right frontoparietal cortex. The Six Letter Cancellation Task (SLCT) measures sustained attention. Development of sustained attention in a yoga-based education system compared to a modern one is the theme of the present study. AIM: To compare the effectiveness of the Modern Education System (MES) and the Gurukula Education System (GES) in developing sustained attention. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty nine boys (11-13 years) were selected from two residential schools, one MES and the other GES, providing similar ambiance and daily routines. The boys were matched for age and socioeconomic status. The GES educational program is based around integrated yoga modules while the MES provides a conventional modern education program. Sustained attention was assessed using the SLCT at the start and end of an academic year. RESULTS: Within groups, the pre-post test differences were significant for both groups. However, the between groups result showed improvement in the GES group compared to the MES group at a P < 0.001 significance level. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that both MES and GES improve sustained attention in school boys, but GES is more effective.	Rangan, R;Nagendra, H R;Bhatt, Ramachandra	2009 Jan
21234213	Effect of yoga relaxation techniques on performance of digit-letter substitution task by teenagers.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Memory and selective attention are important skills for academic and professional performance. Techniques to improve these skills are not taught either in education or company training courses. Any system which can systematically improve these skills will be of value in schools, universities, and workplaces. AIMS: To investigate possible improvements in memory and selective attention, as measured by the Digit-Letter Substitution Task (DLST), due to practice of Cyclic Meditation (CM), a yoga relaxation technique, as compared to Supine Rest (SR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects consisted of 253 school students, 156 boys, 97 girls, in the age range 13-16 years, who were attending a 10-day yoga training course during summer vacation. The selected subjects had English as their medium of instruction in school and they acted as their own controls. They were allocated to two groups, and tested on the DLST, immediately before and after 22.5 minutes practice of CM on one day, and immediately before and after an equal period of SR on the other day. The first group performed CM on day 9 and SR on day 10. For the second group, the order was reversed. RESULTS: Within each group pre-post test differences were significant for both the relaxation techniques. The magnitude of net score improvement was greater after SR (7.85%) compared to CM (3.95%). Significance levels were P < 0.4 x 10(-9)for SR and P < 0.1 x 10(-3) for CM. The number of wrong attempts also increased significantly on both interventions, even after removing two outlier data points on day 1 in the SR group. CONCLUSIONS: Both CM and SR lead to improvement in performance on the DLST. However, these relaxation techniques lead to more wrong cancellation errors.	Pradhan, Balaram;Nagendra, H R	2009 Jan
21234212	Can physical activity maintain normal grades of body mass index and body fat percentage?	BACKGROUND/AIMS: A cross-sectional study was undertaken on 767 urban male volunteers performing physical activity and 469 age and socioeconomic status matched controls not doing any physical activity from the city limits of North India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Height and weight were recorded for each participant to determine their Body Mass Index (BMI). Body fat percentage and weight was measured using a body fat monitor. RESULTS: Fifty three percent of the physical activity performers showed normal BMI compared to 49% nonphysical activity performers. Overweight was observed in 43.3% physical activity performers compared to 44.7% nonphysical activity performers. Fifty two percent of physical activity performers had normal body fat percent compared to 48.5% nonphysical activity performers. Low body fat percent was observed in 23.4% physical activity performers compared to 2.7% nonphysical activity performers. High body fat percent was observed in 48.7% nonphysical activity performers compared to 45.8% physical activity performers. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the study suggested that physical activity alone cannot maintain BMI and body fat percent, but it can reduce the risk of overweight and high body fat percent in the population.

21234211	The effect of various breathing exercises (pranayama) in patients with bronchial asthma of mild to moderate severity.	BACKGROUND/AIM: The incidence of bronchial asthma is on increase. Chemotherapy is helpful during early course of the disease, but later on morbidity and mortality increases. The efficacy of yoga therapy though appreciated is yet to be defined and modified. AIM: To study the effect of breathing exercises (pranayama) in patients with bronchial asthma of mild to moderate severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty cases of bronchial asthma (Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) > 70%) were studied for 12 weeks. Patients were allocated to two groups: group A and group B (control group). Patients in group A were treated with breathing exercises (deep breathing,Brahmari, and Omkara, etc.) for 20 minutes twice daily for a period of 12 weeks. Patients were trained to perform Omkara at high pitch (forceful) with prolonged exhalation as compared to normal Omkara. Group B was treated with meditation for 20 minutes twice daily for a period of 12 weeks. Subjective assessment, FEV1%, and Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) were done in each case initially and after 12 weeks. RESULTS: After 12 weeks, group A subjects had significant improvement in symptoms, FEV1, and PEFR as compared to group B subjects. CONCLUSION: Breathing exercises (pranayama), mainly expiratory exercises, improved lung function subjectively and objectively and should be regular part of therapy.

21234210	A randomized control trial of the effect of yoga on Gunas (personality) and Self esteem in normal healthy volunteers.	BACKGROUND/AIMS: To study the efficacy of yoga on Gunas (personality) and self esteem in normal adults through a randomized comparative study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of the 1228 persons who attended motivational lectures, 226 subjects aged 18-71 years, of both sexes, who satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and who consented to participate in the study were randomly allocated into two groups. The Yoga (Y) group practised an integrated yoga module that included asanas, pranayama, meditation, notional correction, and devotional sessions. The comparison group practised mild to moderate physical exercises (PE). Both groups had supervised practices for one hour daily, six days a week, for eight weeks. Guna (personality) was assessed before and after eight weeks using the self-administered "The 'Gita" Inventory of Personality" (GIN) to assess Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas. Self esteem in terms of competency (COM), global self esteem (GSE), moral and self esteem (MSE), social esteem (SET), family self esteem (FSE), body and physical appearance (BPA), and the lie scale (LIS) were assessed using the self esteem questionnaire (SEQ). RESULTS: The baseline scores for all domains for both the groups did not differ significantly (P > 0.05 independent samples t-test). There were significant pre-post improvements in all domains in both groups (P < 0.001 paired t-test). The number of persons who showed improvement in Sattva and decrease in Tamas was significant in the Y but not in the PE group (McNemar test). The effect size for self esteem in the Y group is greater than for the PE group in three out of seven domains. CONCLUSIONS: This randomized controlled study has shown the influence of Yoga on Gunas and self esteem in comparison to physical exercise.

20681086	Grasping at ontological straws: overcoming reductionism in the Advaita Vedanta-Neuroscience dialogue.	Contemporary neuropsychology reveals that the parietal lobe contains neurons that are specifically attuned to the act of grasping and this act may be fundamental to the establishment of the phenomenal boundaries between subject and object. Furthermore, alterations to this process, such as the hypoactivation of this region during meditation or the hyperactivation associated with schizophrenia, may eliminate or confuse, respectively, the phenomenal boundaries between subject and object. Traversing disciplines, the Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism traces some of its key terms for subject and object to the verbal root grah, to grasp. The subject is literally the grasper. Furthermore, the practice of asparsa yoga, the yoga of no-touch, is aimed at stopping, hypoactivating, the grasping process in order to transcend all subject-object boundaries. This paper will argue that while we have not uncovered an identity of thought, we have uncovered a confluence of ideas between these two disciplines. We will see that this confluence of ideas has not pitted the believer against the critic-not forced us into the great reductionism debate that has dominated so much of the interchange between religious studies and the sciences. This case study will illuminate some of the methodological ways around this reductionism battle and also the boundaries of both disciplines for the intellectual benefit of each.	Kaplan, Stephen	2009
20617123	Seekership, Spirituality and Self-Discovery: Ayurveda Trainees in Britain.	This paper examines the backgrounds and motivations of persons trained or training as Ayurvedic practitioners at two London-based institutions offering Ayurveda programmes at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. It draws upon in-depth interviews with individuals at various stages of their training and practice in order to examine the paths that bring them to Ayurveda, their motivations for undergoing training, and the ways in which they apply their knowledge of Ayurveda during and after their training period. The findings here corroborate what other scholars have demonstrated in the case of Asian traditions like Yoga and Ayurveda in the West; these traditions have inevitably undergone shifts in meaning by virtue of their assimilation into the Western, in this case British, holistic health milieu. Most significant in Ayurveda's case is the shift away from a preoccupation with remedial medicine (the bedrock of mainstream Ayurveda in modern South Asia), to a focus on self-knowledge and self-empowerment as a path to 'holistic healing' (understood to address mental and spiritual, not just physical, wellbeing). Even though the Ayurvedic curriculum transmitted at the educational institutions in London is based largely on that taught at Ayurveda colleges in India, the completely different orientations and dispositions of students in Britain (as compared to their South Asian counterparts) ensures that the Ayurveda they go on to apply and practise is radically different - this is 'spiritualised' Ayurveda, in radical contrast to the 'biomedicalised' version obtaining in modern mainstream South Asian contexts.

19114222	Anxiolytic effects of a yoga program in early breast cancer patients undergoing conventional treatment: a randomized controlled trial.	OBJECTIVES: This study compares the anxiolytic effects of a yoga program and supportive therapy in breast cancer outpatients undergoing conventional treatment at a cancer centre. METHODS: Ninety-eight stage II and III breast cancer outpatients were randomly assigned to receive yoga (n=45) or brief supportive therapy (n=53) prior to their primary treatment i.e., surgery. Only those subjects who received surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and six cycles of chemotherapy were chosen for analysis following intervention (yoga, n=18, control, n=20). Intervention consisted of yoga sessions lasting 60min daily while the control group was imparted supportive therapy during their hospital visits as a part of routine care. Assessments included Speilberger's State Trait Anxiety Inventory and symptom checklist. Assessments were done at baseline, after surgery, before, during, and after radiotherapy and chemotherapy. RESULTS: A GLM-repeated measures ANOVA showed overall decrease in both self-reported state anxiety (p<0.001) and trait anxiety (p=0.005) in yoga group as compared to controls. There was a positive correlation between anxiety states and traits with symptom severity and distress during conventional treatment intervals. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that yoga can be used for managing treatment-related symptoms and anxiety in breast cancer outpatients.

19110245	Effect of integrated yoga on stress and heart rate variability in pregnant women.	OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of integrated yoga practice and guided yogic relaxation on both perceived stress and measured autonomic response in healthy pregnant women. METHOD: The 122 healthy women recruited between the 18th and 20th week of pregnancy at prenatal clinics in Bangalore, India, were randomized to practicing yoga and deep relaxation or standard prenatal exercises 1-hour daily. The results for the 45 participants per group who completed the study were evaluated by repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: Perceived stress decreased by 31.57% in the yoga group and increased by 6.60% in the control group (P=0.001). During a guided relaxation period in the yoga group, compared with values obtained before a practice session, the high-frequency band of the heart rate variability spectrum (parasympathetic) increased by 64% in the 20th week and by 150% in the 36th week, and both the low-frequency band (sympathetic), and the low-frequency to high-frequency ratio were concomitantly reduced (P<0.001 between the 2 groups). Moreover, the low-frequency band remained decreased after deep relaxation in the 36th week in the yoga group. CONCLUSION: Yoga reduces perceived stress and improves adaptive autonomic response to stress in healthy pregnant women.

19102742	Traditional Indian medicine and homeopathy for HIV/AIDS: a review of the literature.	BACKGROUND: Allopathic practitioners in India are outnumbered by practitioners of traditional Indian medicine and homeopathy (TIMH), which is used by up to two-thirds of its population to help meet primary health care needs, particularly in rural areas. India has an estimated 2.5 million HIV infected persons. However, little is known about TIMH use, safety or efficacy in HIV/AIDS management in India, which has one of the largest indigenous medical systems in the world. The purpose of this review was to assess the quality of peer-reviewed, published literature on TIMH for HIV/AIDS care and treatment. RESULTS: Of 206 original articles reviewed, 21 laboratory studies, 17 clinical studies, and 6 previous reviews of the literature were identified that covered at least one system of TIMH, which includes Ayurveda, Unani medicine, Siddha medicine, homeopathy, yoga and naturopathy. Most studies examined either Ayurvedic or homeopathic treatments. Only 4 of these studies were randomized controlled trials, and only 10 were published in MEDLINE-indexed journals. Overall, the studies reported positive effects and even "cure" and reversal of HIV infection, but frequent methodological flaws call into question their internal and external validity. Common reasons for poor quality included small sample sizes, high drop-out rates, design flaws such as selection of inappropriate or weak outcome measures, flaws in statistical analysis, and reporting flaws such as lack of details on products and their standardization, poor or no description of randomization, and incomplete reporting of study results. CONCLUSION: This review exposes a broad gap between the widespread use of TIMH therapies for HIV/AIDS, and the dearth of high-quality data supporting their effectiveness and safety. In light of the suboptimal effectiveness of vaccines, barrier methods and behavior change strategies for prevention of HIV infection and the cost and side effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for its treatment, it is both important and urgent to develop and implement a rigorous research agenda to investigate the potential risks and benefits of TIMH and to identify its role in the management of HIV/AIDS and associated illnesses in India.

19099570	Treatments for irritable bowel syndrome: patients' attitudes and acceptability.	BACKGROUND: Irritable Bowel Syndrome, a highly prevalent chronic disorder, places significant burden on the health service and the individual. Symptomatic distress and reduced quality of life are compounded by few efficacious treatments available. As researchers continue to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of alternative therapies, it would be useful to gain a patient-perspective of treatment acceptability and identify patient's attitudes towards those modalities considered not acceptable. METHODS: Six hundred and forty-five participants identified from an earlier IBS-prevalence study received a postal questionnaire to evaluate preferences and acceptability of nine forms of treatment. Proportions accepting each form of treatment were calculated and thematic analysis of qualitative data undertaken. RESULTS: A total of 256 (39.7%) of 645 potential respondents completed the questionnaire (mean age 55.9 years, 73% female). Tablets were most acceptable (84%), followed by lifestyle changes (diet (82%), yoga (77%)). Acupuncture (59%) and suppositories (57%) were less acceptable. When explaining lack of acceptability, patient views fell into four broad categories: dislike treatment modality, do not perceive benefit, general barriers and insufficient knowledge. Scepticism, lack of scientific rationale and fear of CAM were mentioned, although others expressed a dislike of conventional medical treatments. Past experiences, age and health concerns, and need for proof of efficacy were reported. CONCLUSION: Most patients were willing to accept various forms of treatment. However, the reservations expressed by this patient-population must be recognised with particular focus directed towards allaying fears and misconceptions, seeking further evidence base for certain therapies and incorporating physician support and advice.

19090937	Eastern approaches for enhancing women's sexuality: mindfulness, acupuncture, and yoga (CME).	INTRODUCTION: A significant proportion of women report unsatisfying sexual experiences despite no obvious difficulties in the traditional components of sexual response (desire, arousal, and orgasm). Some suggest that nongoal-oriented spiritual elements to sexuality might fill the gap that more contemporary forms of treatment are not addressing. AIM: Eastern techniques including mindfulness, acupuncture, and yoga, are Eastern techniques, which have been applied to women's sexuality. Here, we review the literature on their efficacy. METHODS: Our search revealed two empirical studies of mindfulness, two of acupuncture, and one of yoga in the treatment of sexual dysfunction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Literature review of empirical sources. RESULTS: Mindfulness significantly improves several aspects of sexual response and reduces sexual distress in women with sexual desire and arousal disorders. In women with provoked vestibulodynia, acupuncture significantly reduces pain and improves quality of life. There is also a case series of acupuncture significantly improving desire among women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Although yoga has only been empirically examined and found to be effective for treating sexual dysfunction (premature ejaculation) in men, numerous historical books cite benefits of yoga for women's sexuality. CONCLUSIONS: The empirical literature supporting Eastern techniques, such as mindfulness, acupuncture, and yoga, for women's sexual complaints and loss of satisfaction is sparse but promising. Future research should aim to empirically support Eastern techniques in women's sexuality.	Brotto, Lori A;Krychman, Michael;Jacobson, Pamela	2008 Dec

19075418	Central retinal vein occlusion following Sirsasana (headstand posture).	We report a case of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) following Sirsasana, a head-down postural yoga. A 55-year-old male patient presented to us, with sudden-onset loss of vision following Sirsasana, in the right eye. The patient had suffered from pulmonary thromboembolism 5 years earlier and was receiving warfarin prophylaxis. Over 6 months of follow-up, the patient developed neovascularization of the iris and was subjected to panretinal laser with no improvement in visual acuity. Sirsasana could be an important risk factor for CRVO especially in predisposed patients.	Shah, Nikunj J;Shah, Urmi N	2009 Jan-Feb

19054292	Paediatric melioidosis in North Queensland, Australia.	AIM: to review admissions to the hospital due to Paediatric Melioidosis over a 10 year period. METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review of all paediatric patients admitted to Townsville Hospital between 1996 and 2006 that were proven to have positive cultures for B. pseudomallei. Details were obtained from the Microbiology Department of Townsville Hospital. RESULTS: Between 1996 and 2006, there were 150 cases of culture-confirmed melioidosis in North Queensland. Of these, eight (5.3%) were in children aged under 16 years. There were three deaths in this group. Three patients developed neurological melioidosis and there were no cases of parotid involvement. In our series, neurological melioidosis appeared to be statistically more significant in children compared with adults. CONCLUSION: Melioidosis is an uncommon paediatric infection in Australia. In our series, neurological melioidosis appeared to be common in children compared with adults with devastating sequelae. The reasons for this remain unclear.	Kandasamy, Yoga;Norton, Robert	2008 Dec

19012133	Non-traditional psychiatric treatments in Asia.	Non-traditional (Eastern/non-conventional) treatments have gained increased interest and recognition recently. The utilization of these treatments in psychiatry challenges mental health professionals to examine the impact of cultural factors and the bi-directional effects of body on mind and mind on body when treating psychiatric illnesses. Professionals in the psychiatric field need to be aware of commonly practised treatments used by people in Asia, the most populous region in the world. There is a wide variety of non-traditional (Eastern) psychiatric treatments in Asia. This article selects only a few commonly practised treatments and describes the clinical application of each treatment.	Liu, Pozi;Zhu, Weiguo;Pi, Edmond H	2008 Oct

18991515	Yoga for veterans with chronic low-back pain.	OBJECTIVES: Chronic back pain affects a large proportion of both the general population and of military veterans. Although numerous therapies exist for treating chronic back pain, they can be costly and tend to have limited effectiveness. Thus, demonstrating the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of additional treatment alternatives is important. The purpose of our study was to examine the benefits of a yoga intervention for Veterans Administration (VA) patients. SUBJECTS/INTERVENTION: VA patients with chronic back pain were referred by their primary care providers to a yoga program as part of clinical care. Before starting yoga, a VA physician trained in yoga evaluated each patient to ensure that they could participate safely. DESIGN: The research study consisted of completing a short battery of questionnaires at baseline and again 10 weeks later. OUTCOME MEASURES: Questionnaires included measures of pain, depression, energy/fatigue, health-related quality of life, and program satisfaction. Paired t-tests were used to compare baseline scores to those at the 10-week follow-up for the single group, pre-post design. Correlations were used to examine whether yoga attendance and home practice were associated with better outcomes. RESULTS: Baseline and follow-up data were available for 33 participants. Participants were VA patients with a mean age of 55 years. They were 21% female, 70% white, 52% married, 68% college graduates, and 44% were retired. Significant improvements were found for pain, depression, energy/fatigue, and the Short Form-12 Mental Health Scale. The number of yoga sessions attended and the frequency of home practice were associated with improved outcomes. Participants appeared highly satisfied with the yoga instructor and moderately satisfied with the ease of participation and health benefits of the yoga program. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary data suggest that a yoga intervention for VA patients with chronic back pain may improve the health of veterans. However, the limitations of a pre-post study design make conclusions tentative. A larger randomized, controlled trial of the yoga program is planned.

Siddha Samadhi Yoga is a program in which meditation is associated with pranayama (breathing exercises). 22 volunteers with anxiety complaints (M age = 42.8 yr., SD = 10.3) were assigned to two groups: 14 attended the yoga group, and 8 attended a waiting-list or control group. They were evaluated before the intervention and 1 month after it on the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory, Tension Feelings Self-evaluation Scales, and the Well-being Self-evaluation Scales. A significant reduction in scores on anxiety, depression, and tension was found in yoga group, as well as an increase in well-being in comparison with the control group.

18955338	Yoga Practice for the Management of Type II Diabetes Mellitus in Adults: A systematic review.	The effect of practicing yoga for the management of type II Diabetes was assessed in this systematic review through searching related electronic databases and the grey literature to the end of May 2007 using Ovid. All randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) comparing yoga practice with other type of intervention or with regular practice or both, were included regardless of language or type of publication. Each study was assessed for quality by two independent reviewers. Mean difference was used for summarizing the effect of each study outcomes with 95% confidence intervals. Pooling of the studies did not take place due to the wide clinical variation between the studies. Publication bias was assessed by statistical methods. Five trials with 363 participants met the inclusion criteria with medium to high risk of bias and different intervention characteristics. The studies' results show improvement in outcomes among patients with diabetes type II. These improvements were mainly among short term or immediate diabetes outcomes and not all were statistically significant. The results were inconclusive and not significant for the long-term outcomes. No adverse effects were reported in any of the included studies. Short-term benefits for patients with diabetes may be achieved from practicing yoga. Further research is needed in this area. Factors like quality of the trials and other methodological issues should be improved by large randomized control trials with allocation concealment to assess the effectiveness of yoga on diabetes type II. A definitive recommendation for physicians to encourage their patients to practice yoga cannot be reached at present.	Aljasir, Badr;Bryson, Maggie;Al-Shehri, Bandar	2010 Dec
18947826	Sleep quality, depression state, and health status of older adults after silver yoga exercises: cluster randomized trial.	BACKGROUND: Sleep disturbances, depression, and low perception of health status are commonly seen in elderly population; however, clinicians tend to underestimate or overlook the presence of these symptoms and assume them to be a part of normal aging. Non-pharmacological methods that promote a mind-body interaction should be tested to enhance the mental health of older adults. OBJECTIVE: To test the effects of 6 months of silver yoga exercises in promoting the mental health of older adults in senior activity centers, especially their sleep quality, depression, and self-perception of health status. DESIGN: Cluster randomized trial. SETTINGS: Eight senior activity centers, southern Taiwan. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 139 participants was recruited, and 128 of them completed the study. INCLUSION CRITERIA: (1) community-dwelling older adults ages 60 and over, (2) no previous training in yoga, (3) able to walk without assistance, (4) cognitively alert based on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) score of eight or higher, and (5) independent or mildly dependent in self-care based on a Barthel Index (BI) score of 91 or higher. The mean age of the participants was 69.20 +/- 6.23 years, and the average number of chronic illness was 0.83 +/- 0.90. The average BI score of the participants was 99.92 +/- 0.62, and the mean SPMSQ score was 9.90 +/- 0.30. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned into either the experimental (n=62) or the control (n=66) group based on attendance at selected senior activity centers. A 70-min silver yoga exercise program was implemented three times per week for 6 months as the intervention for the participants in the experimental group. RESULTS: Most of the mental health indicators of the participants in the experimental group had significantly improved after the silver yoga interventions, and many of the indicators improved after 3 months of intervention and were maintained throughout the 6 months study. The mental health indicators of the participants in the experimental group were all better than the participants in the control group (all p<.05). CONCLUSIONS: After 6 months of silver yoga exercises, the sleep quality, depression, and health status of older adults were all improved.

18844516	Benefits, barriers, and cues to action of yoga practice: a focus group approach.	OBJECTIVES: To explore perceived benefits, barriers, and cues to action of yoga practice among adults. METHODS: Focus groups were conducted with persons who had never practiced yoga, practitioners of one year or less, and practitioners for more than one year. The Health Belief Model was the theoretical foundation of inquiry. RESULTS: All participants acknowledged a variety of benefits of yoga. Barriers outweighed benefits among persons who had never practiced despite knowledge of benefits. Positive experiences with yoga and yoga instructors facilitated practice. CONCLUSIONS: Newly identified benefits and barriers indicate the need for quantitative research and behavioral trials.	Atkinson, Nancy L;Permuth-Levine, Rachel	2009 Jan-Feb
18834271	Comparison of the conceptualization of wisdom in ancient Indian literature with modern views: focus on the Bhagavad Gita.	The study of wisdom has recently become a subject of growing scientific interest, although the concept of wisdom is ancient. This article focuses on conceptualization of wisdom in the Bhagavad Gita, arguably the most influential of all ancient Hindu philosophical/religious texts. Our review, using mixed qualitative/quantitative methodology with the help of Textalyser and NVivo software, found the following components to be associated with the concept of wisdom in the Gita: Knowledge of life, Emotional Regulation, Control over Desires, Decisiveness, Love of God, Duty and Work, Self-Contentedness, Compassion/Sacrifice, Insight/Humility, and Yoga (Integration of Personality). A comparison of the conceptualization of wisdom in the Gita with that in modern scientific literature shows several similarities, such as rich knowledge about life, emotional regulation, insight, and a focus on common good (compassion). Apparent differences include an emphasis on control over desires and renunciation of materialistic pleasures. Importantly, the Gita suggests that at least certain components of wisdom can be taught and learned. We believe that the concepts of wisdom in the Gita are relevant to modern psychiatry in helping develop psychotherapeutic interventions that could be more individualistic and more holistic than those commonly practiced today, and they aim at improving personal well-being rather than just psychiatric symptoms.

18831354	Effect of '61-points relaxation technique' on stress parameters in premenstrual syndrome.	Premenstrual Syndrome is a psychoneuroendocrine stress related disorder and more than 300 treatment modalities for PMS show that the existing remedies have not provided satisfactory help to relieve PMS. 61-points relaxation exercise (61-PR), a relatively less known hatha yoga technique, is a successful means of stress relaxation and is expected to relieve PMS as well. The present study was conducted on 50 clinically healthy women volunteers who were in their reproductive age group and in their premenstrual period, from which a control group (n = 20) and a PMS group (n = 30) based on the symptoms were identified. In both groups basal heart rate (HR/min), systolic (SBP; mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP; mmHg), electromyogram (EMG; mV), electrodermal galvanic activity (EDG; microv), respiratory rate (RR/min) and peripheral temperature (T; degrees F) were recorded and the subjects were taken through a guided 61-PR. The symptoms and parameters were re-recorded after the 61-PR. In control group, the basal HR was 82.06 +/- 8.07, SBP 111.95 +/- 8.23, DBP 76.8 +/- 6.42, EMG 4.08 +/- 2.99, EDG 9.77 +/- 3.29, RR 15.60 +/- 3.77 and T was 97.86 +/- 0.63. After 10 minutes of 61-PR, HR (77.27 +/-10.85, P < 0.05), SBP (107.35 +/- 7.41, P < 0.05), DBP (75.25 +/-7.57, P < 0.05), EMG (2.07 +/- 1.90, P < 0.05), EDG (8.06 +/- 2.87, P < 0.05), RR (16.00 +/- 4.12, P < 0.05) fell significantly and T (97.97 +/- 0.64, P > 0.05) rose significantly. In the PMS group, the basal HR was 90.61 +/- 8.46, SBP 122.5 +/- 11.52, DBP 83.53 +/- 8.26, EMG 5.79 +/-2.75, EDG 13.14 +/- 6.54, RR 19.13 +/- 3.76 and T was 93.43 -/+ 5.29. After 10 minutes of 61-PR, HR (75.58 +/- 10.11, P < 0.0001), SBP (114.53 +/- 9.70, p < 0.0001), DBP (77.46 +/- 8.68, P < 0.0001), EMG (2.56 +/- 1.77, P < 0.0001), EDG (10.64 +/- 5.72, P < 0.0001), and RR (16.13 +/- 3.76, P < 0.0001) declined to a much greater extent and T (93.49 +/- 5.28, P < 0.0001) rose more significantly. These results suggest a reduction in sympathetic activity by 61-PR, also the high basal sympathetic tone present in subjects of PMS group due to stress is considerably reduced by relaxation. 61-PR is effective in providing relief from PMS and may be a useful adjuvant to medical therapy of PMS and other stress disorders.

18826781	Help-seeking preferences for psychological distress in primary care: effect of current mental state.	BACKGROUND: There is much debate over when it is appropriate to intervene medically for psychological distress, and limited evidence on patients' perspectives about a broad range of possible treatment options. It is currently unclear whether preferences may differ for those patients with milder symptoms compared to those experiencing more severe distress. AIM: To determine patient preferences for professional, informal, and alternative help for psychological distress in primary care, and the impact of their current mental state on these. DESIGN OF STUDY: Cross-sectional survey in seven general practices across suburban/urban London. METHOD: Participants were 1357 consecutive general practice attenders aged 18 years and over. The main outcome measure was the General Health Questionnaire 12-item version and a questionnaire on help-seeking preferences. RESULTS: Overall, only 47% of participants reported wanting 'some help' if feeling stressed, worried, or low and it was affecting their daily life. Those currently experiencing mild-to-moderate distress preferred informal sources of help such as friends/family support, relaxation/yoga, exercise/sport, or massage along with general advice from their GP and talking therapies. Self-help (books/leaflets or computer/internet) was not popular at any level of distress, and less favoured by those with mild-to-moderate distress (odds ratio [OR] = 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.35 to 0.70). Those experiencing severe distress were much more likely to want talking therapies (OR = 3.43, 95% CI = 2.85 to 4.14), tablets (OR = 3.07, 95% CI = 2.00 to 4.71), and support groups (OR = 3.07, 95% CI = 1.72 to 5.47). CONCLUSION: People with mild-to-moderate distress appear to prefer informal sources of help and those involving human contact, compared to medication or self-help. This has implications for the implementation of potential interventions for psychological distress in primary care.	Walters, Kate;Buszewicz, Marta;Weich, Scott;King, Michael	2008 Oct
23105788	Influence of pranayamas and yoga-asanas on serum insulin, blood glucose and lipid profile in type 2 diabetes.	A distinguishable feature of type 2 diabetes besides hyperglycemia and deranged lipid profile is an impaired insulin secretion, peripheral insulin resistance and obesity which has become a major health concern worldwide. India with an estimated 31million diabetics in 2000 and 79mllions by the yr 2030 has the highest number of type 2 diabetics in the world. In this study, we aimed to see if yoga-asanas and pranayamas have any influence in modifying certain biochemical parameters. Sixty patients of uncomplicated type 2 diabetes (age 35-60 yrs of 1-10 yrs duration) were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n=30): performed yoga along with the conventional hypoglycemic medicines and group 2 (n=30): patients who only received conventional medicines. Duration of the study was 45 days. Basal recordings of blood glucose (fasting and post-prandial), lipid profile and serum insulin were taken at the time of recruitment and the second reading after forty five days. Results showed a significant improvement in all the biochemical parameters in group 1 while group 2 showed significant improvement in only few parameters, thus suggesting a beneficial effect of yoga regimen on these parameters in diabetic patients.

20664144	A review of the literature examining the physiological processes underlying the therapeutic benefits of Hatha yoga.	An estimated 7.4 million Americans currently practice Hatha yoga. Moreover, 64% of individuals who practice yoga report doing so for well-being. Previous research has reported an association between yoga practice and subjective well-being; however, few studies have investigated the physiological mechanisms involved. The following review provides an historical overview of the field of integrative medicine, which conceptualizes yoga as a mind-body practice. A brief description of Hatha yoga is provided that describes the purported relationship between yoga and the relaxation response. A review of the emerging literature related to nitric oxide and oxidative stress as potential mechanisms in the relationship between yoga and well-being also is included. The article concludes with a brief discussion of the state of the research and provides suggestions for future studies.	Dunn, Karen D	2008 Fall
18821529	An evidence-based review of yoga as a complementary intervention for patients with cancer.	OBJECTIVE: To conduct an evidence-based review of yoga as an intervention for patients with cancer. Specifically, this paper reviewed the impact of yoga on psychological adjustment among cancer patients. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted between May 2007 and April 2008. Data from each identified study were extracted by two independent raters; studies were included if they assessed psychological functioning and focused on yoga as a main intervention. Using a quality rating scale (range = 9-45), the raters assessed the methodological quality of the studies, and CONSORT guidelines were used to assess randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Effect sizes were calculated when possible. In addition, each study was narratively reviewed with attention to outcome variables, the type of yoga intervention employed, and methodological strengths and limitations. RESULTS: Ten studies were included, including six RCTs. Across studies, the majority of participants were women, and breast cancer was the most common diagnosis. Methodological quality ranged greatly across studies (range = 15.5-42), with the average rating (M = 33.55) indicating adequate quality. Studies also varied in terms of cancer populations and yoga interventions sampled. CONCLUSIONS: This study provided a systematic evaluation of the yoga and cancer literature. Although some positive results were noted, variability across studies and methodological drawbacks limit the extent to which yoga can be deemed effective for managing cancer-related symptoms. However, further research in this area is certainly warranted. Future research should examine what components of yoga are most beneficial, and what types of patients receive the greatest benefit from yoga interventions.	Smith, Kelly B;Pukall, Caroline F	2009 May

18815948	Beyond the individual: group effects in mindfulness-based stress reduction.	The authors explored the group as a source of change in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR). Participants consisted of 606 adults in 59 groups who completed an 8-week MBSR program. The authors examined change in the General Symptom Index (GSI) of the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised and the Medical Symptom Checklist (MSC) from pre- to postintervention. Multilevel models were used to examine the extent to which groups differed in the amount of change reported by the participants. After controlling for pretreatment severity, group accounted for 7% of the variability in the GSI and 0% in the MSC. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for the practice of MBSR as well as for research investigating the effects of MBSR and other programs or psychotherapies.

18810037	Knowledge about idiopathic scoliosis among students of physiotherapy.	The aim of the study was to determine the level of basic knowledge about idiopathic scoliosis (IS) among students of physiotherapy. The study included 37 students of Medical University of Silesia (17F and 20M aged 22-25, mean 22.6), attending the 3(rd) year of a 1(st) degree of physiotherapy. All students had credits in kinesiotherapy, including methods of conservative treatment of IS. Students were examined using a questionnaire, comprising general knowledge of IS, questions related to sagittal plane correction, influence of various physical activities on IS and known methods of conservative treatment. 81 students considered IS as 3-D deformity. 62.2% of those questioned would diagnose IS when the Cobb angle reaches 10 degrees . All students agreed that the aetiology of IS remains unknown. 54.1% considered forcible extensory exercises of back as favourable in IS. Questioned students mostly preferred swimming (94.6%), yoga (73.0%) and martial arts (32.4%) as beneficial to IS. The methods of conservative treatment which were known best were: Lehnert-Schroth-Weiss (94.6%), Klapp (91.9%), Majoch (89.2%) and Dobosiewicz (78.4%). The conclusions indicate that the average level of knowledge of idiopathic scoliosis among students of physiotherapy is unsatisfactory, despite the education programme including the SOSORT guidelines. Education in the field of scoliosis should be comprehensive and meet contemporary guidelines and standards.	Ciazynski, D;Czernicki, K;Durmala, J	2008

18808628	Physical fitness of older adults in senior activity centres after 24-week silver yoga exercises.	AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Promoting physical fitness of young-older adults is essential in reducing healthcare expenditures which would occur in the future for those with chronic health problems. The silver yoga exercise programme was developed to accommodate the reduced body flexibility experienced by many older adults and was critically reviewed by experts and pilot-tested with community-dwelling older adults. This study aimed to test older adults' physical fitness after a 24-week silver yoga exercise programme and to examine whether the programme could be further shortened to fit senior activity centres' programme designs. DESIGN: A quasi-experimental, pre-post tests design was used: baseline, at 12-week and at 24-week periods. METHODS: Convenience samples of 204 subjects were recruited from eight senior activity centres and 176 subjects completed the study. Subjects were randomly assigned into three groups based on the centres: (1) Experiment I: complete silver yoga with stretching and meditation, (2) Experiment II: shortened silver yoga without the guided-imagery meditation and (3) Wait-list control. The interventions were conducted three times per week for 24 weeks. Physical fitness indicators included body compositions, cardiovascular-respiratory functions, physical functions and the range of motion. RESULTS: At the end of the 24-week period, the physical fitness of subjects in Experiments I and II had significantly improved whether or not guided-imagery meditation was used and all had better physical fitness than subjects in the control group (all p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The physical fitness of older adults in both the 70-minute complete silver yoga group and the 55-minute shortened silver yoga group had significantly improved after the interventions. It was recommended that the silver yoga programme be shortened by eliminating the guided-imagery meditation. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The shortened silver yoga exercise programme is recommended to be incorporated as an activity programme in community-settings to promote the physical fitness of older adults.

18780582	Pregnancy and labor alternative therapy research.	This review covers research from the last 5 years on the most popular complementary and alternative therapies used during pregnancy and labor and potential underlying biological bases for their effects. MEDLINE was searched and papers were reviewed for the most popular complementary and alternative therapies used during pregnancy and labor, including massage therapy, acupuncture, relaxation, yoga, and exercise. The pregnancy research generally suggests that alternative therapies have been effective for reducing pregnancy-related back and leg pain and nausea and for reducing depression and cortisol levels and the associated prematurity rate. The labor research generally shows that alternative therapies reduce pain and thereby the need for medication. Although the literature suggests positive effects of alternative therapies for pregnancy and labor and some potential biological mechanisms, the research has several methodological limitations.

18779682	Menopause, the metabolic syndrome, and mind-body therapies.	Cardiovascular disease risk rises sharply with menopause, likely due to the coincident increase in insulin resistance and related atherogenic changes that together comprise the metabolic or insulin resistance syndrome, a cluster of metabolic and hemodynamic abnormalities strongly implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease. A growing body of research suggests that traditional mind-body practices such as yoga, tai chi, and qigong may offer safe and cost-effective strategies for reducing insulin resistance syndrome-related risk factors for cardiovascular disease in older populations, including postmenopausal women. Current evidence suggests that these practices may reduce insulin resistance and related physiological risk factors for cardiovascular disease; improve mood, well-being, and sleep; decrease sympathetic activation; and enhance cardiovagal function. However, additional rigorous studies are needed to confirm existing findings and to examine long-term effects on cardiovascular health.	Innes, Kim E;Selfe, Terry Kit;Taylor, Ann Gill	2008 Sep-Oct
18769575	Impact and outcomes of an Iyengar yoga program in a cancer centre.	BACKGROUND: Individuals have increasingly sought complementary therapies to enhance health and well-being during cancer, although little evidence of their effect is available. OBJECTIVES: We investigated how an Iyengar yoga program affects the self-identified worst symptom in a group of participants. Whether quality of life, spiritual well-being, and mood disturbance change over the Iyengar yoga program and at 6 weeks after the program. How, from a participant's perspective, the Iyengar yoga program complements conventional cancer treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This pre-post instrumental collective case study used a mixed methods design and was conducted at a private Iyengar yoga studio. The sample consisted of 24 volunteers (23 women, 1 man; 88% Caucasian; mean age: 49 years) who were currently on treatment or who had been treated for cancer within the previous 6 months, and who participated in ten 90-minute weekly Iyengar yoga classes. The main outcome measures were most-bothersome symptom (Measure Your Medical Outcome Profile 2 instrument), quality of life and spiritual well-being (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-General subscale and Spiritual subscale), and mood disturbance (Profile of Mood States-Short Form). Participant perspectives were obtained in qualitative interviews. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements were reported in most-bothersome symptom (t((23)) = 5.242; p < 0.001), quality of life (F((2,46)) = 14.5; p < 0.001), spiritual well-being (F((2,46)) = 14.4; p < 0.001), and mood disturbance (F((2,46)) = 10.8; p < 0.001) during the program. At follow-up, quality of life (t((21)) = -3.7; p = 0.001) and mood disturbance (t((21)) = 2.4; p = 0.025) significantly improved over time. Categorical aggregation of the interview data showed that participants felt the program provided them with various benefits not included on the outcomes questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS: Over the course of the Iyengar Yoga for Cancer program, participants reported an improvement in overall well-being. The program was also found to present participants with a holistic approach to care and to provide tools to effectively manage the demands of living with cancer and its treatment.

26525515	Paediatric Pain Management: Using Complementary and Alternative Medicine.	Children undergo acute painful procedures and many also experience chronic pain.Due to their developing systems, infants and children may be at greater risk than adults for protracted pain sensitivity.There is a need to manage acute and chronic paediatric pain to reduce children's suffering and to prevent future pain problems.Consistent with a biopsychosocial perspective, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) should be considered in management of acute and chronic paediatric pain.Although research is limited for paediatric pain, CAM interventions receiving the most empirical attention include hypnotherapy, acupuncture and music therapy. Evidence also exists for the therapeutic benefits of yoga, massage, humor therapy and the use of certain biological based therapies.	Evans, Subhadra;Tsao, Jennie C I;Zeltzer, Lonnie K	2008 Sep

18717444	Progressive optic neuropathy in congenital glaucoma associated with the Sirsasana yoga posture.	The authors describe a case of progressive optic neuropathy in a patient with congenital glaucoma who had routinely practiced the Sirsasana (headstand) yoga posture for several years. Ophthalmic examination included best-corrected visual acuity, anterior segment examination, indirect ophthalmoscopy, ultrasound pachymetry for central corneal thickness, and intraocular pressure before, during, and after maintaining the Sirsasana posture for 5 minutes. Intraocular pressure increased significantly during the Sirsasana posture. Transient elevation in intraocular pressure during yoga exercises may lead to progressive glaucomatous optic neuropathy, especially in susceptible patients with congenital glaucoma.	de Barros, Daniela S Monteiro;Bazzaz, Sheila;Gheith, Moataz E;Siam, Ghada A;Moster, Marlene R	2008 Jul-Aug
18714217	Yoga as steadiness training: effects on motor variability in young adults.	Exercise training programs can increase strength and improve submaximal force control, but the effects of yoga as an alternative form of steadiness training are not well described. The purpose was to explore the effect of a popular type of yoga (Bikram) on strength, steadiness, and balance. Young adults performed yoga training (n = 10, 29 +/- 6 years, 24 yoga sessions in 8 weeks) or served as controls (n = 11, 26 +/- 7 years). Yoga sessions consisted of 1.5 hours of supervised, standardized postures. Measures before and after training included maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) force of the elbow flexors (EF) and knee extensors (KE), steadiness of isometric EF and KE contractions, steadiness of concentric (CON) and eccentric (ECC) KE contractions, and timed balance. The standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV, SD/mean force) of isometric force and the SD of acceleration during CON and ECC contractions were measured. After yoga training, MVC force increased 14% for KE (479 +/- 175 to 544 +/- 187 N, p < 0.05) and was unchanged for the EF muscles (219 +/- 85 to 230 +/- 72 N, p > 0.05). The CV of force was unchanged for EF (1.68 to 1.73%, p > 0.05) but was reduced in the KE muscles similarly for yoga and control groups (2.04 to 1.55%, p < 0.05). The variability of CON and ECC contractions was unchanged. For the yoga group, improvement in KE steadiness was correlated with pretraining steadiness (r = -0.62 to -0.84, p < 0.05); subjects with the greatest KE force fluctuations before training experienced the greatest reductions with training. Percent change in balance time for individual yoga subjects averaged +228% (19.5 +/- 14 to 34.3 +/- 18 seconds, p < 0.05), with no change in controls. For young adults, a short-term yoga program of this type can improve balance substantially, produce modest improvements in leg strength, and improve leg muscle control for less-steady subjects.

18710330	Restorative yoga in adults with metabolic syndrome: a randomized, controlled pilot trial.	BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome increases the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Yoga improves some metabolic parameters, but it has not been studied in persons with metabolic syndrome. We conducted a randomized controlled pilot trial to determine whether a restorative yoga intervention was feasible and acceptable in underactive, overweight adults with metabolic syndrome. METHODS: Twenty six underactive, overweight adult men and women with metabolic syndrome were randomized to attend 15 yoga sessions of 90 minutes each over 10 weeks or to a wait-list control group. Feasibility was measured by recruitment rates, subject retention, and adherence. Acceptability was assessed by interview and questionnaires. Changes in metabolic outcomes and questionnaire measures from baseline to week 10 were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 280 people were screened by phone, and 93 with high likelihood of metabolic syndrome were invited to a screening visit. Of the 68 who attended screening visits, 26 (38%) were randomized, and 24 (92%) completed the trial. Attendance at yoga classes and adherence to home practice exceeded our goals. In the yoga group, all participants gave the study the highest possible satisfaction rating, and the majority (87%) felt that the yoga poses were easy to perform. There was trend to reduced blood pressure (p = 0.07), a significant increase in energy level (p < 0.009), and trends to improvement in well-being (p < 0.12) and stress (p < 0.22) in the yoga versus control group. CONCLUSIONS: Restorative yoga was a feasible and acceptable intervention in overweight adults with metabolic syndrome. The efficacy of yoga for improving metabolic parameters in this population should be explored in a larger randomized controlled trial.

18704692	Mind-body interventions in oncology.	OPINION STATEMENT: A number of mind-body interventions have been studied for use with cancer patients, primarily measuring outcomes relating to pain control, anxiety reduction, and enhancing quality of life. This chapter defines the scope and characteristics of mind-body interventions, followed by a selective review of research indicating their appropriate use or cautions in cancer care. Mind-body interventions included are hypnosis, imagery/relaxation, meditation, yoga, and creative therapies. Current evidence supports the efficacy of hypnosis and imagery/relaxation for control of pain and anxiety during cancer treatments. Meditation is supported for reductions in stress and improvements in mood, quality of life, and sleep problems. There is a growing body of support for yoga from randomized controlled trials for improving quality of life, sleep, and mood. Creative therapies such as visual arts, dance, and music may help cancer patients express their feelings and cope with the demands of a cancer experience. Research on biological marker effects of mind-body therapies remains inconclusive. Study of mind-body interventions generally requires additional, methodologically rigorous investigation of how various interventions best assist patients during various phases of cancer survivorship, although a major benefit of these therapies lies in the opportunity for patients to self-select them.

18700626	Effect of alternate nostril breathing exercise on cardiorespiratory functions.	Pranayama (breathing exercise), one of the yogic techniques can produce different physiological responses in healthy individuals. The responses of Alternate Nostril Breathing (ANB) the Nadisudhi Pranayama on some cardio-respiratory functions were investigated in healthy young adults. The subjects performed ANB exercise (15 minutes everyday in the morning) for four weeks. Cardio-respiratory parameters were recorded before and after 4-weeks training period. A significant increment in Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR L/min) and Pulse pressure (PP) was noted. Although Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was decreased insignificantly, the decrease in pulse rate (PR), respiratory rate (RR), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were significant. Results indicate that regular practice of ANB (Nadisudhi) increases parasympathetic activity.	Upadhyay Dhungel, K;Malhotra, V;Sarkar, D;Prajapati, R	2008 Mar

18690948	Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder: controversies of diagnosis and safety of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment.	Attention-Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a condition that presents with a variety of behavioral and social problems. The objective of this review was to examine the evidence concerning the controversies surrounding the diagnosis of ADHD and the safety of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment. A MEDLINE search was conducted using MeSH terms ADHD, children, treatments or behavioral therapy. The search was limited to January 1990 to present, randomized clinical trials, retrospective studies and English. Fifty-seven articles were selected for review. Controversies exist regarding the diagnosis: variations exist by gender, across countries and by method of diagnosis. These issues are currently unresolved. The interventions with the most data concerning their safety and efficacy in children were stimulant medications. Children with ADHD who took stimulant medications showed the greatest improvement in behavior when compared to other interventions such as behavior therapy or family counseling. Limitations of behavior therapy included that it is often a difficult process to continue on an ongoing basis and only a portion of the therapy stimulated the child's natural reward system. However, a combination of both stimulant medication and behavior therapy demonstrated synergistic efficacy. Care must be taken to insure that issues of gender and race, as well as the adverse effects of treatment options, are adequately taken into account by the treating clinician.

18673078	Effect of short-term intensive yoga program on pain, functional disability and spinal flexibility in chronic low back pain: a randomized control study.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the effect of a short-term intensive residential yoga program with physical exercise (control) on pain and spinal flexibility in subjects with chronic low-back pain (CLBP). DESIGN: This was a wait-list, randomized controlled study. SETTING: The study was conducted at a residential integrative health center in Bangalore, South India. SUBJECTS: Eighty (80) subjects (females, n = 37) with CLBP, who consented were randomly assigned to receive yoga or physical exercise if they satisfied the selection criteria. INTERVENTION: The intervention consisted of a 1-week intensive residential yoga program comprised of asanas (physical postures) designed for back pain, pranayamas (breathing practices), meditation, and didactic and interactive sessions on philosophical concepts of yoga. The control group practiced physical exercises under a trained physiatrist and also had didactic and interactive sessions on lifestyle change. Both of the groups were matched for time on intervention and attention. OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain-related outcomes were assessed by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and by spinal flexibility, which was assessed using goniometer at pre and post intervention. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA). RESULTS: Data conformed to a Gaussian distribution. There was a significant reduction in ODI scores in the yoga group compared to the control group (p = 0.01; effect size 1.264). Spinal flexibility measures improved significantly in both groups but the yoga group had greater improvement as compared to controls on spinal flexion (p = 0.008; effect size 0.146), spinal extension (p = 0.002; effect size 0.251), right lateral flexion (p = 0.059; effect size 0.006); and left lateral flexion (p = 0.006; effect size 0.171). CONCLUSIONS: Seven (7) days of a residential intensive yoga-based lifestyle program reduced pain-related disability and improved spinal flexibility in patients with CLBP better than a physical exercise regimen.

BACKGROUND: Functional Bowel Disorders (FBD) are chronic disorders that are difficult to treat and manage. Many patients and doctors are dissatisfied with the level of improvement in symptoms that can be achieved with standard medical care which may lead them to seek alternatives for care. There are currently no data on the types of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) used for FBDs other than Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), or on the economic costs of CAM treatments. The aim of this study is to determine prevalence, types and costs of CAM in IBS, functional diarrhea, functional constipation, and functional abdominal pain. METHODS: 1012 Patients with FBD were recruited through a health care maintenance organization and followed for 6 months. Questionnaires were used to ascertain: Utilization and expenditures on CAM, symptom severity (IBS-SS), quality of life (IBS-QoL), psychological distress (BSI) and perceived treatment effectiveness. Costs for conventional medical care were extracted from administrative claims. RESULTS: CAM was used by 35% of patients, at a median yearly cost of $200. The most common CAM types were ginger, massage therapy and yoga. CAM use was associated with female gender, higher education, and anxiety. Satisfaction with physician care and perceived effectiveness of prescription medication were not associated with CAM use. Physician referral to a CAM provider was uncommon but the majority of patients receiving this recommendation followed their physician's advice. CONCLUSION: CAM is used by one-third of FBD patients. CAM use does not seem to be driven by dissatisfaction with conventional care. Physicians should discuss CAM use and effectiveness with their patients and refer patients if appropriate.	van Tilburg, Miranda A L;Palsson, Olafur S;Levy, Rona L;Feld, Andrew D;Turner, Marsha J;Drossman, Douglas A;Whitehead, William E	2008 Jul 24
18651193	Characteristics of yoga users: results of a national survey.	BACKGROUND: There are limited data on the characteristics of yoga users in the U.S. OBJECTIVE: To characterize yoga users, medical reasons for use, perceptions of helpfulness, and disclosure of use to medical professionals. METHODS: Utilizing cross-sectional survey data from the 2002 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Alternative Medicine Supplement (n = 31044), we examined correlates of yoga use for health. The estimated prevalence from 2002 NHIS of yoga for health was 5.1% corresponding to over 10 million adults. RESULTS: In 2002, yoga users were predominately Caucasian (85%) and female (76%) with a mean age of 39.5 years. Compared to non-yoga users, yoga users were more likely female (OR 3.76, 95% CI 3.11-4.33); less likely black than white (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.53-0.80); tended to be younger; and more likely college educated (OR 2.70, 95% CI 2.37-3.08). Musculoskeletal conditions (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.42-1.83), mental health conditions (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.22-1.67), severe sprains in the last 12 months (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.22-1.81), and asthma (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05-1.54) were independently associated with higher yoga use, while hypertension (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64-0.95) and chronic obstructive lung disease (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48-1.00) were associated with lower use. Yoga was most commonly used to treat musculoskeletal or mental health conditions, and most users reported yoga to be helpful for these conditions. A majority of yoga users (61%) felt yoga was important in maintaining health, though only 25% disclosed yoga practice to their medical professional. CONCLUSIONS: We found that yoga users are more likely to be white, female, young and college educated. Yoga users report benefit for musculoskeletal conditions and mental health, indicating that further research on the efficacy of yoga for the treatment and/or prevention of these conditions is warranted.

18646158	Physical activity programs for persons with dementia.	BACKGROUND: There is some evidence that physical activity delays the onset of dementia in healthy older adults and slows down cognitive decline to prevent the onset of cognitive disability. Studies using animal models suggest that physical activity has the potential to attenuate the pathophysiology of dementia. 'Physical activity' refers to 'usual care plus physical activity'. OBJECTIVES: Primary: do physical activity programs maintain or improve cognition, function, behaviour, depression, and mortality compared to usual care in older persons with dementia?Secondary: do physical activity programs have an indirect positive impact on family caregivers' health, quality of life, and mortality compared to family caregivers of older persons with dementia who received usual care alone? Do physical activity programs reduce the use of health care services (e.g., visits to the emergency department) compared to usual care in older persons with dementia and their family caregiver? SEARCH STRATEGY: The trials were identified from searches of the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group, The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS on 9 September 2007 using the search terms: exercise OR "physical activity" OR cycling OR swim* OR gym* OR walk* OR danc* OR yoga OR "tai chi". SELECTION CRITERIA: All relevant, randomized controlled trials in which physical activity programs were compared with usual care for the effect on managing or improving cognition, function, behaviour, depression, and mortality in people with dementia of any type and degree of severity. Secondary outcomes related to the family caregiver(s) included quality of life, mortality, and use of health care services were intended to be examined. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently assessed the retrieved articles for relevance and methodological quality, and extracted data from the selected trials. These were pooled were appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: Four trials met the inclusion criteria. However, only two trials were included in the analyses because the required data from the other two trials were not made available. Only one meta-analysis was conducted. The results from this review suggest that there is insufficient evidence of the effectiveness of physical activity programs in managing or improving cognition, function, behaviour, depression, and mortality in people with dementia. Few trials have examined these important outcomes. In addition, family caregiver outcomes and use of health care services were not reported in any of the included trials. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to be able to say whether or not physical activity programs are beneficial for people with dementia.

18640629	Complementary therapy use by persons with multiple sclerosis: benefits and research priorities.	People with multiple sclerosis (MS) are commonly actively involved in self-care, with many accessing complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) to help in symptom management. To provide increased insight into benefits from CAM use and service user ideas over research priorities, a two-part study, involving a questionnaire and interactive workshop, was undertaken with attendees at a national Congress of the MS Trust in the UK. The six most used therapies were reflexology, massage, yoga, relaxation and meditation, acupuncture and aromatherapy. Each was rated by a quarter to two-fifths as 'extremely helpful'. Insight into the nature of the therapeutic benefit was provided in user comments. Despite the self-selected nature of the sample, the findings point to potential benefits of a set of CAM therapies in helping people with MS. More research on potential benefits of therapies was called for by participants and on the dynamics of the therapeutic effect.	Esmonde, Lisa;Long, Andrew F	2008 Aug
18632773	Complementary and alternative medicine for multiple sclerosis.	We analyzed characteristics, motivation, and effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine in a large sample of people with multiple sclerosis. A 53-item survey was mailed to the members of the German Multiple Sclerosis Society, chapter of Baden-Wuerttemberg. Surveys of 1573 patients (48.5 +/- 11.7 years, 74% women, duration of illness 18.1 +/- 10.5 years) were analyzed. In comparison with conventional medicine, more patients displayed a positive attitude toward complementary and alternative medicine (44% vs 38%, P < 0.05), with 70% reporting lifetime use of at least one method. Among a wide variety of complementary and alternative medicine, diet modification (41%), Omega-3 fatty acids (37%), removal of amalgam fillings (28%), vitamins E (28%), B (36%), and C (28%), homeopathy (26%), and selenium (24%) were cited most frequently. Most respondents (69%) were satisfied with the effects of complementary and alternative medicine. Use of complementary and alternative medicine was associated with religiosity, functional independence, female sex, white-collar job, and higher education (P < 0.05). Compared with conventional therapies, complementary and alternative medicine rarely showed unwanted side effects (9% vs 59%, P < 0.00001). A total of 52% stated that the initial consultation with their physician lasted less than 15 min. To conclude, main reasons for the use of complementary and alternative medicine include the high rate of side effects and low levels of satisfaction with conventional treatments and brief patients/physicians contacts.

22557297	Diet and regimen during pregnancy.	To rely on Ayurveda is the best way to ensure a safe and natural childbirth. Ayurveda understands all the factors, which bring about a hazard-free childbirth. By following a regulated diet and regimen, the pregnant mother is prepared for a natural delivery. By helping nature to take its course, women enjoy a risk-free childbirth. This paper provides a broad view of the diet and regimen during pregnancy.	Girija, P Lt	2008 Jul
22557295	Anaemia among women and children of India.	Anaemia is a major public health issue in India today. Anemia can be called our national disease and in fact it is a national calamity. The figures for anemia among women and children of India are truly staggering. It is estimated that more than half of all Indian women and (3/4)th of Indian children suffer from anemia. The paradox about anemia is that, in India the level of anemia does not seem to have any relationship with the ^material wealth of the state- measured in terms of Net State Domestic Product (NSDP). Nor does anemia seem to have any relationship to the nutritional intake in different states measured in terms of calories proteins and fat. Neither the nutritionists nor the economists and sociologists of our country are able to provide any insight into this paradox. The only explanation possible for this paradox is provided by an Ayurvedic perspective. Ayurveda understands and treats anemia effectively and can offer a solution for this national problem.

21829289	A randomized control trial of the effect of yoga on verbal aggressiveness in normal healthy volunteers.	OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of yoga on verbal aggressiveness in normal healthy adults. METHODS: Of the 1228 persons who attended introductory lectures, 226 subjects of both sexes who satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria and who consented to participate in the study were randomly allocated into two groups. These 226 subjects were between the ages of 17 and 62 years and 173/226 completed the eight weeks of intervention. The Yoga (Y) group practised an integrated yoga module that included asanas, pranayama, meditation, notional correction, and devotional sessions. The control group practised mild to moderate physical exercises (PE). Both groups had supervised practices (by trained experts) for one hour daily, six days a week for eight weeks. Verbal Aggressiveness was assessed before and after eight weeks using the self-administered Verbal Aggressive Scale. RESULTS: The baseline score of the two groups did not differ significantly (P = 0.66). There was a significant decrease in verbal aggressiveness in the yoga group (P = 0.01 paired samples t-test) with a nonsignificant increase in the PE group. ANCOVA using pre- values as covariates showed a significant difference between the groups (P = 0.013). RMANOVA for interaction between the sexes or age groups in change scores were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: This study has demonstrated that an eight week intervention of an integrated yoga module decreased verbal aggressiveness in the yoga group (in males and those below 25 years of age), with a nonsignificant increase in the PE group.

21829288	Normative data for the letter-cancellation task in school children.	AIMS: To establish the norms for the letter-cancellation task-a psychomotor performance task. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight hundred nineteen school students were selected in the present study in an age range between nine and 16 years (M = 12.14; SD = 1.78 years). Subjects were assessed once for the cancellation task. RESULTS: Both age and sex influenced performance on the SLCT; therefore, correction scores were obtained on the basis of these factors. CONCLUSIONS: The availability of Indian normative data for the SLCT will allow wider application of this test in clinical practice.	Pradhan, Balaram;Nagendra, H R	2008 Jul
21829287	Investigating paranormal phenomena: Functional brain imaging of telepathy.	AIM: "Telepathy" is defined as "the communication of impressions of any kind from one mind to another, independently of the recognized channels of sense". Meta-analyses of "ganzfield" studies as well as "card-guessing task" studies provide compelling evidence for the existence of telepathic phenomena. The aim of this study was to elucidate the neural basis of telepathy by examining an individual with this special ability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using functional MRI, we examined a famous "mentalist" while he was performing a telepathic task in a 1.5 T scanner. A matched control subject without this special ability was also examined under similar conditions. RESULTS: The mentalist demonstrated significant activation of the right parahippocampal gyrus after successful performance of a telepathic task. The comparison subject, who did not show any telepathic ability, demonstrated significant activation of the left inferior frontal gyrus. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study are suggestive of a limbic basis for telepathy and warrant further systematic research.

21829286	Planning ability improves in a yogic education system compared to a modern.	BACKGROUND: Planning skills play a key role in higher developmental processes. The Tower of London test not only measures planning skills, but also the ability to execute plans. Yoga practices aim to bring about higher development. Can a Yoga-based education system be shown to meet this challenge? AIM: This study was aimed at comparing a Modern Education System (MES) with the ancient Yoga-based system of education, the Gurukula Education System (GES), in developing planning skills. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-nine boys with ages ranging from 11 to 13 years were selected from each of two residential schools, one MES and the other GES, providing similar ambience and daily routines. The boys were matched for age and socio-economic status. The GES educational program is based around integrated yoga modules while the MES provides a conventional modern education program. Planning and executive abilities were assessed using the Tower of London test at the start and the end of an academic year. RESULTS: Within groups, the pre-post test differences were significant for both groups. However, the between-groups results showed improvement in the GES group compared to the MES group at a P < 0.001 significance level. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that whereas both MES and GES Yoga-based education improve planning and execution skills in school boys, GES is more effective of the two systems.

21829285	Nostril dominance at rest associated with performance of a left hemisphere-specific cancellation task.	BACKGROUND: An association has been reported between the dominant nostril through which we breathe and the cerebral hemisphere found to be active. AIMS: To understand the association between the nostril dominant at rest and the performance in a cancellation task using verbal information-a left hemisphere task. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred eighty-nine normal, healthy volunteers attending a one week nonresidential yoga camp were assessed in a single 30 minute period. Nostril dominance was assessed using a standard method. After this, participants were given the letter cancellation task and nostril dominance was again checked. For each participant, the numbers of letters that had been left out and wrongly cancelled as well as total errors were assessed. The Mann-Whitney u test and Chi-Square test were used to assess whether there was a significant difference in cancellation task performance between right and left nostril-dominant persons. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between right and left nostril-dominant participants. CONCLUSIONS: The present results do not support previous findings of contralateral cerebral hemisphere improvement with breathing through a specific nostril.

21829284	Modulation of immune responses in stress by Yoga.	Stress is a constant factor in today's fastpaced life that can jeopardize our health if left unchecked. It is only in the last half century that the role of stress in every ailment from the common cold to AIDS has been emphasized, and the mechanisms involved in this process have been studied. Stress influences the immune response presumably through the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis, hypothalamic pituitary-gonadal axis, and the sympathetic-adrenal-medullary system. Various neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, hormones, and cytokines mediate these complex bidirectional interactions between the central nervous system (CNS) and the immune system. The effects of stress on the immune responses result in alterations in the number of immune cells and cytokine dysregulation. Various stress management strategies such as meditation, yoga, hypnosis, and muscle relaxation have been shown to reduce the psychological and physiological effects of stress in cancers and HIV infection. This review aims to discuss the effect of stress on the immune system and examine how relaxation techniques such as Yoga and meditation could regulate the cytokine levels and hence, the immune responses during stress.

20664141	Ten years of treating eating disorders: what have we learned? A personal perspective on the application of 12-step and wellness programs.	Conventional therapy for eating disorders has focused on behavioral approaches, medical models, and combinations of both, with lesser emphasis on psychological and wellness models. Because eating disorders are often difficult to treat and the individuals who have them often exhibit significant comorbidities, the long-term success rate (3-5 years or more)-defined as recovery and abstinence from the disorder behaviors-is in the 40% to 50% range, at best. Moreover, if one examines randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that test the efficacy of the most commonly used behavioral approaches in a historical manner, as is described in this article, by assigning RCTs to 2 different time periods for the treatment of bulimia nervosa (BN), it is found that no progress has been made in the success rate of treating this disorder. Many reasons exist for this lack of progress, including comorbidities, failure of patient-therapist relationships to be dynamic, failure to appreciate that BN and binge eating disorder have addiction components that might require 12-step or multimodal approaches, and an absence of treating the whole person, which requires using a wellness model and elements such as body awareness exercises, yoga, and spirituality. Based on a review of the literature and my personal experience over the last 10 years, it is suggested that best practices for treating these disorders should include wellness and 12-step models that focus less on self-centeredness, highlighting the strengths of the person and helping individuals to find their true spirituality, which can be used as a focal point for all treatment. Conventional approaches can still be useful in treating eating disorders, but clinicians and psychiatrists should cease seeing eating disorders as "diseases" that should be treated by pharmacodynamics and consider that these are conditions that have taken many years to develop and that have many background psychological factors, often reaching back to childhood.

18556004	Influence of angular acceleration-deceleration pulse shapes on regional brain strains.	Recognizing the association of angular loading with brain injuries and inconsistency in previous studies in the application of the biphasic loads to animal, physical, and experimental models, the present study examined the role of the acceleration-deceleration pulse shapes on region-specific strains. An experimentally validated two-dimensional finite element model representing the adult male human head was used. The model simulated the skull and falx as a linear elastic material, cerebrospinal fluid as a hydrodynamic material, and cerebrum as a linear viscoelastic material. The angular loading matrix consisted coronal plane rotation about a center of rotation that was acceleration-only (4.5 ms duration, 7.8 krad/s/s peak), deceleration-only (20 ms, 1.4 krad/s/s peak), acceleration-deceleration, and deceleration-acceleration pulses. Both biphasic pulses had peaks separated by intervals ranging from 0 to 25 ms. Principal strains were determined at the corpus callosum, base of the postcentral sulcus, and cerebral cortex of the parietal lobe. The cerebrum was divided into 17 regions and peak values of average maximum principal strains were determined. In all simulations, the corpus callosum responded with the highest strains. Strains were the least under all simulations in the lower parietal lobes. In all regions peak strains were the same for both monophase pulses suggesting that the angular velocity may be a better metric than peak acceleration or deceleration. In contrast, for the biphasic pulse, peak strains were region- and pulse-shape specific. Peak values were lower in both biphasic pulses when there was no time separation between the pulses than the corresponding monophase pulse. Increasing separation time intervals increased strains, albeit non-uniformly. Acceleration followed by deceleration pulse produced greater strains in all regions than the other form of biphasic pulse. Thus, pulse shape appears to have an effect on regional strains in the brain.	Yoganandan, Narayan;Li, Jianrong;Zhang, Jiangyue;Pintar, Frank A;Gennarelli, Thomas A	2008 Jul 19
18552604	Contextualizing the effects of yoga therapy on diabetes management: a review of the social determinants of physical activity.	This article provides a review of literature both to identify the effects of yoga-based therapy on the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus and to examine the social context of physical activity. Findings from the review indicate that yoga has a positive short-term effect on multiple diabetes-related outcomes; however, long-term effects of yoga therapy on diabetes management remain unclear. The context of the social environment, including interpersonal relationships, community characteristics, and discrimination, influences the adoption and maintenance of health behaviors such as physical activity, including yoga practice. Further research is necessary to determine the extent of this influence.	Alexander, Gina K;Taylor, Ann Gill;Innes, Karen E;Kulbok, Pamela;Selfe, Terry K	2008 Jul-Sep
18551817	Is prenatal childbirth preparation effective in decreasing adverse maternal and neonatal response to labor? A nested case-control study.	Sophrology, based on a combination of Western relaxation therapy and Eastern yoga and meditation might decrease maternal stress during labor. This study aimed to evaluate whether prenatal sophrologic childbirth preparation may decrease maternal and neonatal adverse response associated with delivery. In a nested case-control study, 69 nulliparous, singleton pregnant women who underwent an educational course of sophrologic childbirth preparation were compared to 69 nulliparous, singleton, age- and gestational age-matched pregnant women who did not receive any childbirth preparation. All babies were vaginally delivered. Groups were not different (P > 0.05) in the number of neonates born with meconium-stained amniotic fluid as well as in the number of babies with Apgar score < or = 7 at 1 and 5 minutes after birth. Duration of labor was not different between groups. The number of women requiring oxytocin and delivering babies with low pH blood levels tended to be lower in the group undergoing sophrologic childbirth preparation, i.e. 58.0% vs 72.5% (P = 0.07) and 1.4% vs 10.9% (P = 0.06), respectively. In conclusion, we were unable to confirm that prenatal sophrologic childbirth preparation has a definitive role in decreasing adverse maternal and fetal response to pain or in shortening labor. Prospective cohort studies with a larger sample size or randomized trials may help to clarify this gap.

18544284	Restorative yoga for women with ovarian or breast cancer: findings from a pilot study.	Yoga has demonstrated benefit in healthy individuals and those with various health conditions. There are, however, few systematic studies to support the development of yoga interventions for cancer patients. Restorative yoga (RY) is a gentle type of yoga that has been described as "active relaxation." The specific aims of this pilot study were to determine the feasibility of implementing an RY intervention as a supportive therapy for women diagnosed with ovarian or breast cancer and to measure changes in self-reported fatigue, psychological distress and well-being, and quality of life. Fifty-one women with ovarian (n = 37) or breast cancer (n = 14) with a mean age of 58.9 years enrolled in this study; the majority (61%) were actively undergoing cancer treatment at the time of enrollment. All study participants participated in 10 weekly 75-minute RY classes that combined physical postures, breathing, and deep relaxation. Study participants completed questionnaires at baseline, immediately postintervention, and 2 months postintervention. Significant improvements were seen for depression, negative affect, state anxiety, mental health, and overall quality of life. Fatigue decreased between baseline and postintervention follow-up. Health-related quality of life improved between baseline and the 2-month follow-up. Qualitative feedback from participants was predominantly positive; relaxation and shared group experience were two common themes.

18541886	Mind-body interventions: applications in neurology.	OBJECTIVE: Half of the adults in the United States use complementary and alternative medicine with mind-body therapy being the most commonly used form. Neurology patients often turn to their physicians for insight into the effectiveness of the therapies and resources to integrate them into their care. The objective of this article is to give a clinical overview of mind-body interventions and their applications in neurology. METHODS: Medline and PsychInfo were searched on mind-body therapies and neurologic disease search terms for clinical trials and reviews and published evidence was graded. RESULTS: Meditation, relaxation, and breathing techniques, yoga, tai chi, and qigong, hypnosis, and biofeedback are described. Mind-body therapy application to general pain, back and neck pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, headaches, fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, muscular dysfunction, stroke, aging, Parkinson disease, stroke, and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder are reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: There are several conditions where the evidence for mind-body therapies is quite strong such as migraine headache. Mind-body therapies for other neurology applications have limited evidence due mostly to small clinical trials and inadequate control groups.

18514933	Effects of yoga on inflammation and exercise capacity in patients with chronic heart failure.	BACKGROUND: Despite recent advances in pharmacologic and device therapy, morbidity and mortality from heart failure (HF) remain high. Yoga combines physical and breathing exercises that may benefit patients with HF. We hypothesized that an 8-week regimen of yoga in addition to standard medical therapy would improve exercise capacity, inflammatory markers, and quality of life (QoL) in patients with HF. METHODS AND RESULTS: New York Heart Association Class I-III HF patients were randomized to yoga treatment (YT) or standard medical therapy (MT). Measurements included a graded exercise test (GXT) to V O(2Peak) and the following serum biomarkers: interleukin-6 (IL-6), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD). The Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) was administered to assess changes in QoL. A total of 19 patients were enrolled after the initial screening. Of the 19 patients, 9 were randomized to YT and 10 to MT. Patients had a mean EF of 25%. GXT time and V O(2Peak) were significantly improved in the YT versus MT groups (+18% in the YT and -7.5% in MT; P = .03 vs. control and +17 in YT and -7.1 in MT; P = .02, respectively). There were statistically significant reductions in serum levels of IL-6 and hsCRP and an increase in EC-SOD in the YT group (all P < .005 vs. MT). MLHFQ scores improved by 25.7% in the YT group and by 2.9% in the MT group. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga improved exercise tolerance and positively affected levels of inflammatory markers in patients with HF, and there was also a trend toward improvements in QoL.

18512052	Tactile acuity in experienced Tai Chi practitioners: evidence for use dependent plasticity as an effect of sensory-attentional training.	The scientific discovery of novel training paradigms has yielded better understanding of basic mechanisms underlying cortical plasticity, learning and development. This study is a first step in evaluating Tai Chi (TC), the Chinese slow-motion meditative exercise, as a training paradigm that, while not engaging in direct tactile stimulus training, elicits enhanced tactile acuity in long-term practitioners. The rationale for this study comes from the fact that, unlike previously studied direct-touch tactile training paradigms, TC practitioners focus specific mental attention on the body's extremities including the fingertips and hands as they perform their slow routine. To determine whether TC is associated with enhanced tactile acuity, experienced adult TC practitioners were recruited and compared to age-gender matched controls. A blinded assessor used a validated method (Van Boven et al. in Neurology 54(12): 2230-2236, 2000) to compare TC practitioners' and controls' ability to discriminate between two different orientations (parallel and horizontal) across different grating widths at the fingertip. Study results showed that TC practitioners' tactile spatial acuity was superior to that of the matched controls (P < 0.04). There was a trend showing TC may have an enhanced effect on older practitioners (P < 0.066), suggesting that TC may slow age related decline in this measure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate a long-term attentional practice's effects on a perceptual measure. Longitudinal studies are needed to examine whether TC initiates or is merely correlated with perceptual changes and whether it elicits long-term plasticity in primary sensory cortical maps. Further studies should also assess whether related somatosensory attentional practices (such as Yoga, mindfulness meditation and Qigong) achieve similar effects.

18503578	Effect of yoga on cognitive functions in climacteric syndrome: a randomised control study.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of an integrated approach of yoga therapy (IAYT) on cognitive abilities in climacteric syndrome. DESIGN: A randomised control study wherein the participants were divided into experimental and control groups. SETTINGS: Fourteen centres of Swami Vivekananda Yoga Research Foundation, Bangalore, India. SAMPLE: One hundred and eight perimenopausal women between 40 and 55 years with follicle-stimulating hormone level equal to or greater than 15 miu/ml. One hundred and twenty perimenopausal women were randomly allotted into the yoga and the control groups. METHODS: The yoga group practised a module comprising breathing practices, sun salutation and cyclic meditation, whereas the control group practised a set of simple physical exercises, under supervision (1 hour/day, 5 days/week for 8 weeks). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Assessments were made by vasomotor symptom checklist, six-letter cancellation test (SLCT) for attention and concentration and Punit Govil Intelligence Memory Scale (PGIMS) with ten subtests. RESULTS: The Wilcoxon test showed significant (P < 0.001) reduction in hot flushes, night sweats and sleep disturbance in yoga group, with a trend of significant difference between groups at P = 0.06 on Mann-Whitney test in night sweats. There was no change within or between groups in the control group. The SLCT score and the PGIMS showed significant improvement in eight of ten subtests in the yoga group and six of ten subtests in the control group. The yoga group performed significantly better (P < 0.001) with higher effect sizes in SLCT and seven tests of PGIMS compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Integrated approach of yoga therapy can improve hot flushes and night sweats. It also can improve cognitive functions such as remote memory, mental balance, attention and concentration, delayed and immediate recall, verbal retention and recognition tests.

18503485	Interoceptive awareness in experienced meditators.	Attention to internal body sensations is practiced in most meditation traditions. Many traditions state that this practice results in increased awareness of internal body sensations, but scientific studies evaluating this claim are lacking. We predicted that experienced meditators would display performance superior to that of nonmeditators on heartbeat detection, a standard noninvasive measure of resting interoceptive awareness. We compared two groups of meditators (Tibetan Buddhist and Kundalini) to an age- and body mass index-matched group of nonmeditators. Contrary to our prediction, we found no evidence that meditators were superior to nonmeditators in the heartbeat detection task, across several sessions and respiratory modulation conditions. Compared to nonmeditators, however, meditators consistently rated their interoceptive performance as superior and the difficulty of the task as easier. These results provide evidence against the notion that practicing attention to internal body sensations, a core feature of meditation, enhances the ability to sense the heartbeat at rest.

18477407	Effect of exercise therapy on lipid profile and oxidative stress indicators in patients with type 2 diabetes.	BACKGROUND: Yoga has been shown to be a simple and economical therapeutic modality that may be considered as a beneficial adjuvant for type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study investigated the impact of Hatha yoga and conventional physical training (PT) exercise regimens on biochemical, oxidative stress indicators and oxidant status in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: This prospective randomized study consisted of 77 type 2 diabetic patients in the Hatha yoga exercise group that were matched with a similar number of type 2 diabetic patients in the conventional PT exercise and control groups. Biochemical parameters such as fasting blood glucose (FBG), serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were determined at baseline and at two consecutive three monthly intervals. The oxidative stress indicators (malondialdehyde - MDA, protein oxidation - POX, phospholipase A2 - PLA2 activity) and oxidative status [superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities] were measured. RESULTS: The concentrations of FBG in the Hatha yoga and conventional PT exercise groups after six months decreased by 29.48% and 27.43% respectively (P < 0.0001) and there was a significant reduction in serum TC in both groups (P < 0.0001). The concentrations of VLDL in the managed groups after six months differed significantly from baseline values (P = 0.036). Lipid peroxidation as indicated by MDA significantly decreased by 19.9% and 18.1% in the Hatha yoga and conventional PT exercise groups respectively (P < 0.0001); whilst the activity of SOD significantly increased by 24.08% and 20.18% respectively (P = 0.031). There was no significant difference in the baseline and 6 months activities of PLA2 and catalase after six months although the latter increased by 13.68% and 13.19% in the Hatha yoga and conventional PT exercise groups respectively (P = 0.144). CONCLUSION: The study demonstrate the efficacy of Hatha yoga exercise on fasting blood glucose, lipid profile, oxidative stress markers and antioxidant status in patients with type 2 diabetes and suggest that Hatha yoga exercise and conventional PT exercise may have therapeutic preventative and protective effects on diabetes mellitus by decreasing oxidative stress and improving antioxidant status.

18476387	Role of temporalis muscle over activity in chronic tension type headache: effect of yoga based management.	The role of central versus peripheral mechanisms has always been questioned while explaining the etiopathogenesis of chronic tension type headache (CTTH). The following study was done to study the role of muscle spasm in CTTH. 15 patients of CTTH and 7 age matched controls were included in the study and their m. temporalis EMG was recorded for one minute each during rest, mental activity and maximal voluntary contraction and subjective pain scoring was done by visual analogue scale. The results revealed significant overactivity of m.temporalis in CTTH patients at rest when compared with control subjects (P = 0.01 and 0.03 left and right side respectively). After respective interventions namely non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs, botulinum toxin injections and yogic life style course, the EMG records revealed decrease in the mean EMG amplitude of m. temporalis during rest and mental activity more significantly after yoga based interventions (P = 0.03) and subjective pain scores decreased from 7.00 +/- 2.10 to 2.00 +/- 1.26 (P = 0.02) supporting the beneficial effect of such non invasive techniques.

18463543	Treating the climacteric symptoms in Indian women with an integrated approach to yoga therapy: a randomized control study.	OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of yoga on the climacteric symptoms, perceived stress, and personality in perimenopausal women. DESIGN: One hundred twenty participants (ages 40-55 y) were randomly divided into two study arms, ie, yoga and control. The yoga group practiced an integrated approach to yoga therapy comprising surya namaskara (sun salutation) with 12 postures, pranayama (breathing practices), and avartan dhyan (cyclic meditation), whereas the control group practiced a set of simple physical exercises under supervision of trained teachers for 8 weeks (1 h daily, 5 days per week). The assessments were made by Greene Climacteric Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, and Eysenck's Personality Inventory before and after the intervention. RESULTS: Of the three factors of the Greene Climacteric Scale, the Mann-Whitney test showed a significant difference between groups (P < 0.05) in the vasomotor symptoms, a marginally significant difference (P = 0.06) in psychological factors but not in the somatic component. Effect sizes were higher in the yoga group for all factors. There was a significantly greater degree of decrease in Perceived Stress Scale scores (P < 0.001, independent samples t test) in the yoga group compared with controls (between-group analysis) with a higher effect size in the yoga group (1.10) than the control (0.27). On the Eysenck's Personality Inventory, the decrease in neuroticism was greater (P < 0.05) in the yoga group (effect size = 0.43) than the control group (effect size = 0.21) with no change in extroversion in either the yoga or control group. CONCLUSIONS: Eight weeks of an integrated approach to yoga therapy decreases climacteric symptoms, perceived stress, and neuroticism in perimenopausal women better than physical exercise.

18461841	Embodying the mind: movement as a container for destructive aggression.	Violent, nonmentalizing individuals who act out aggression do not usually respond to verbal therapeutic approaches alone. We suggest the movement in physically oriented therapies, such as yoga and martial arts, combined with psychodynamic psychotherapy are critical in reaching these individuals. We also suggest embodiment as a direct link to the kinesthetic core of easily disturbed attachment experiences. This process embodying the mind requires a safe, containing context found in the therapist. Clinical vignettes show how this might be done in both individual and social contexts. These vignettes also show a way to think about such a combination of techniques and theories.	Twemlow, Stuart W;Sacco, Frank C;Fonagy, Peter	2008

18459121	Meditation with yoga, group therapy with hypnosis, and psychoeducation for long-term depressed mood: a randomized pilot trial.	This randomized pilot study investigated the effects of meditation with yoga (and psychoeducation) versus group therapy with hypnosis (and psychoeducation) versus psychoeducation alone on diagnostic status and symptom levels among 46 individuals with long-term depressive disorders. Results indicate that significantly more meditation group participants experienced a remission than did controls at 9-month follow-up. Eight hypnosis group participants also experienced a remission, but the difference from controls was not statistically significant. Three control participants, but no meditation or hypnosis participants, developed a new depressive episode during the study, though this difference did not reach statistical significance in any case. Although all groups reported some reduction in symptom levels, they did not differ significantly in that outcome. Overall, these results suggest that these two interventions show promise for treating low- to moderate-level depression.

18456339	Complementary and alternative medicine in the treatment of bipolar disorder--a review of the evidence.	A growing number of patients with mood disorders are using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interventions. In this paper, we review the published scientific evidence on the benefits and risks of CAM for the treatment of patients with bipolar disorder. Since very few studies of CAM have involved patients with bipolar disorder, most available evidence is derived from trials conducted in patients with major depressive disorder. The use of omega-3 fatty acids has been studied in two controlled studies in bipolar disorder while St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAMe), and acupuncture have been studied in a series of randomized controlled trials in patients with major depression. Overall, the best evidence supports the use of St. John's wort for the treatment of mild to moderate depression. SAMe may also be effective for depression. However, both of these products have the potential to induce mania; the extent of this risk needs to be quantified. St. John's wort can also interact with a variety of medications. Evidence regarding the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids or acupuncture is inconsistent. Data regarding other CAM interventions (e.g., aromatherapy massage, massage therapy, yoga) are almost entirely lacking. In conclusion, better studies are needed before CAM interventions can be recommended to patients with bipolar disorder. In the meantime, patients need to be informed about the possible risks associated with the use of these interventions.	Andreescu, Carmen;Mulsant, Benoit H;Emanuel, James E	2008 Sep
18451783	Use of complementary and alternative therapies by overweight and obese adults.	OBJECTIVE: Obesity is associated with higher health-care costs due, in part, to higher use of traditional health care. Few data are available on the relationship between obesity and the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). METHODS AND PROCEDURES: We analyzed data on CAM use from the 2002 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Alternative Medicine Supplement (n=31,044). We compared the use of CAM overall, within the past 12 months, between normal weight (BMI from 18 to <25), overweight (from 25 to <30), mildly obese (from 30 to <35), moderately obese (from 35 to <40), and extremely obese (>40) adults. For the primary analysis, our multivariable model was adjusted for sociodemographic factors, insurance status, medical conditions, and health behaviors. We performed additional analyses to explore the association of BMI and the use of seven CAM modalities. RESULTS: We found that adults with obesity have lower prevalence of use of yoga therapy, and similar prevalence of use of several CAM modalities, including relaxation techniques, natural herbs, massage, chiropractic medicine, tai chi, and acupuncture, compared to normal-weight individuals. After adjustment for sociodemographic factors, insurance status, medical conditions, and health behaviors, adults with obesity were generally less likely to use most individual CAM modalities, although the magnitude of these differences were quite modest in many cases. DISCUSSION: Even though adults with obesity have a greater illness burden and higher utilization of traditional medical care, adults with higher BMIs were no more likely to use each of the individual CAM therapies studied. Additional research is needed to improve our understanding of CAM use by adults with obesity.	Bertisch, Suzanne M;Wee, Christina C;McCarthy, Ellen P	2008 Jul

18426568	Psychological, social and biological determinants of ill health (pSoBid): study protocol of a population-based study.	BACKGROUND: Disadvantaged communities suffer higher levels of physical and mental ill health than more advantaged communities. The purpose of the present study was to examine the psychosocial, behavioural and biological determinants of ill health within population groups in Glasgow that differed in socioeconomic status and in their propensity to develop chronic disease especially coronary heart disease and Type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Participants were selected at random from areas known to be at the extremes of the socioeconomic continuum in Glasgow. Within the categories of least deprived and most deprived, recruitment was stratified by sex and age to achieve an overall sample containing approximately equal numbers of males and females and an even distribution across the age categories 35-44, 45-54 and 55-64 years. Individuals were invited by letter to attend for assessment of their medical history, risk factor status, cognitive function and psychological profile, morbidity, and carotid intima-media thickness and plaque count as indices of atherosclerosis. Anonymised data on study subjects were collected from the General Practice Administration System for Scotland to analyse characteristics of participants and non-participants. RESULTS: 700 subjects were recruited. The response (active participants per 100 invitation letters) in the least deprived group was 35.1% and in the most deprived group was 20.3%. Lowest response was seen in young males (least deprived 22.4% and most deprived 14.1%). CONCLUSION: This cross-sectional study recruited the planned sample of subjects from least deprived and most deprived areas within Glasgow. As evident in other studies response differed between the most and least deprived areas. This study brought together researchers/academics from diverse disciplines to build a more sophisticated understanding of the determinants of health inequalities than can be achieved through unidisciplinary approaches. Future analyses will enable an understanding of the relationships between the different types of measure, and of the pathways that link poverty, biology, behaviour and psychology and lead to health inequalities.

18398780	Chest deflections and injuries in oblique lateral impacts.	A majority of laboratory-driven side-impact injury assessments are conducted using postmortem human subjects (PMHS) under the pure lateral mode. Because real-world injuries occur under pure and oblique modes, this study was designed to determine chest deflections and injuries using PMHS under the latter mode. Anthropometrical data were obtained and x-rays were taken. Specimens were seated on a sled and lateral impact acceleration corresponding to a change in velocity of 24 km/h was applied such that the vector was at an angle of 20 or 30 degrees. Chestbands were fixed at the level of the axilla (upper), xyphoid process (middle), and tenth rib (lower) location. Deflection contours as a function of time at the levels of the axilla and mid-sternum, representing the thorax, and at the tenth rib level, representing the abdomen, were evaluated for peak magnitudes. All data were normalized using mass-scaling procedures. Injuries were identified following the test at autopsy. Trauma graded according to the Abbreviated Injury Score, 1990 version, indicated primarily unilateral rib fractures and soft tissue abnormalities such as lung contusion and diaphragm laceration occurred. Mean peak deflections at the upper, middle, and lower levels of the chest for the 30-degree tests were 96.2, 78.5, and 76.8 mm. For the 20-degree tests, these magnitudes were 77.5, 89.9, and 73.6 mm. Statistical analysis indicated no significant (p > 0.05) differences in peak chest deflections at all levels between the two obliquities although the metric was significantly greater in oblique than pure lateral impacts at the mid and lower thoracic levels. These response data are valuable in oblique lateral impact assessments.	Yoganandan, Narayan;Pintar, Frank A;Gennarelli, Thomas A;Martin, Peter G;Ridella, Stephen A	2008 Jun
18396254	Yoga during pregnancy: effects on maternal comfort, labor pain and birth outcomes.	This study examined the effects of a yoga program during pregnancy, on maternal comfort, labor pain, and birth outcomes. A randomized trial was conducted using 74-primigravid Thai women who were equally divided into two groups (experimental and control). The yoga program involved six, 1-h sessions at prescribed weeks of gestation. A variety of instruments were used to assess maternal comfort, labor pain and birth outcomes. The experimental group was found to have higher levels of maternal comfort during labor and 2h post-labor, and experienced less subject evaluated labor pain than the control group. In each group, pain increased and maternal comfort decreased as labor progressed. No differences were found, between the groups, regarding pethidine usage, labor augmentation or newborn Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min. The experimental group was found to have a shorter duration of the first stage of labor, as well as the total time of labor.	Chuntharapat, Songporn;Petpichetchian, Wongchan;Hatthakit, Urai	2008 May
18392106	Current status of herbal drugs in India: an overview.	Herbal drugs constitute a major share of all the officially recognised systems of health in India viz. Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy and Naturopathy, except Allopathy. More than 70% of India's 1.1 billion population still use these non-allopathic systems of medicine. Currently, there is no separate category of herbal drugs or dietary supplements, as per the Indian Drugs Act. However, there is a vast experiential-evidence base for many of the natural drugs. This offers immense opportunities for Observational Therapeutics and Reverse Pharmacology. Evidence-based herbals are widely used in the diverse systems and manufactured, as per the pharmacopoeial guidelines, by a well-organised industry. Significant basic and clinical research has been carried out on the medicinal plants and their formulations, with the state-of-the-art methods in a number of Institutes/Universities. There are some good examples. Indian medicinal plants also provide a rich source for antioxidants that are known to prevent/delay different diseased states. The antioxidant protection is observed at different levels. The medicinal plants also contain other beneficial compounds like ingredients for functional foods. Hence, the global knowledge about Ayurveda and Indian herbals will hopefully be enhanced by information on the evidence-base of these plants. This will yield rich dividends in the coming years.

18370583	A pilot study comparing the effects of mindfulness-based and cognitive-behavioral stress reduction.	OBJECTIVES: The objective of this pilot study was to compare the effects of two mind-body interventions: mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and cognitive-behavioral stress reduction (CBSR). SUBJECTS: Fifty (50) subjects were recruited from the community and took part in MBSR (n = 36) and CBSR (n = 14) courses. Participants self-selected into MBSR or CBSR courses taught at different times. There were no initial differences between the MBSR and CBSR subjects on demographics, including age, gender, education, and income. INTERVENTION: MBSR was an 8-week course using meditation, gentle yoga, and body scanning exercises to increase mindfulness. CBSR was an 8-week course using cognitive and behavioral techniques to change thinking and reduce distress. DESIGN: Perceived stress, depression, psychological well-being, neuroticism, binge eating, energy, pain, and mindfulness were assessed before and after each course. Pre-post scores for each intervention were compared by using paired t tests. Pre-post scores across interventions were compared by using a general linear model with repeated measures. SETTINGS/LOCATIONS: Weekly meetings for both courses were held in a large room on a university medical center campus. RESULTS: MBSR subjects improved on all eight outcomes, with all of the differences being significant. CBSR subjects improved on six of eight outcomes, with significant improvements on well-being, perceived stress, and depression. Multivariate analyses showed that the MBSR subjects had better outcomes across all variables, when compared with the CBSR subjects. Univariate analyses showed that MBSR subjects had better outcomes with regard to mindfulness, energy, pain, and a trend for binge eating. CONCLUSIONS: While MBSR and CBSR may both be effective in reducing perceived stress and depression, MBSR may be more effective in increasing mindfulness and energy and reducing pain. Future studies should continue to examine the differential effects of cognitive behavioral and mindfulness-based interventions and attempt to explain the reasons for the differences.

18348106	Pilot-testing the effects of a newly-developed silver yoga exercise program for female seniors.	This study aimed to pilot-test the health promotion effects of a silver yoga exercise program for female seniors. Using a one-group, pre-post test design, a convenience sample of 16 community-dwelling female seniors was recruited. The silver yoga exercise intervention was administered three times a week, 70 minutes per session, for four weeks. Data were collected at baseline and after completion of the four-week intervention. Results indicated that participants' body fat percentage and systolic blood pressure decreased, balance and range of motion on shoulder flexion and abduction improved, and sleep disturbance was minimized (all p < .05). Preliminary evidence supports that the silver yoga exercise program provides positive effects on the promotion of good health in female seniors living in the communities.

18347974	Immediate effect of specific nostril manipulating yoga breathing practices on autonomic and respiratory variables.	The effect of right, left, and alternate nostril yoga breathing (i.e., RNYB, LNYB, and ANYB, respectively) were compared with breath awareness (BAW) and normal breathing (CTL). Autonomic and respiratory variables were studied in 21 male volunteers with ages between 18 and 45 years and experience in the yoga breathing practices between 3 and 48 months. Subjects were assessed in five experimental sessions on five separate days. The sessions were in fixed possible sequences and subjects were assigned to a sequence randomly. Each session was for 40 min; 30 min for the breathing practice, preceded and followed by 5 min of quiet sitting. Assessments included heart rate variability, skin conductance, finger plethysmogram amplitude, breath rate, and blood pressure. Following RNYB there was a significant increase in systolic, diastolic and mean pressure. In contrast, the systolic and diastolic pressure decreased after ANYB and the systolic and mean pressure were lower after LNYB. Hence, unilateral nostril yoga breathing practices appear to influence the blood pressure in different ways. These effects suggest possible therapeutic applications.

18346056	Self-management strategies to reduce pain and improve function among older adults in community settings: a review of the evidence.	CONTEXT: Self-management strategies for pain hold substantial promise as a means of reducing pain and improving function among older adults with chronic pain, but their use in this age group has not been well defined. OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence regarding self-management interventions for pain due to musculoskeletal disorders among older adults. DESIGN: We searched the Medline and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases to identify relevant articles for review and analyzed English-language articles that presented outcome data on pain, function, and/or other relevant endpoints and evaluated programs/strategies that could be feasibly implemented in the community. Abstracted information included study sample characteristics, estimates of treatment effect, and other relevant outcomes when present. RESULTS: Retained articles (N = 27) included those that evaluated programs sponsored by the Arthritis Foundation and other programs/strategies including yoga, massage therapy, Tai Chi, and music therapy. Positive outcomes were found in 96% of the studies. Proportionate change in pain scores ranged from an increase of 18% to a reduction of 85% (median = 23% reduction), whereas change in disability scores ranged from an increase of 2% to a reduction of 70% (median = 19% reduction). Generalizability issues identified included limited enrollment of ethnic minority elders, as well as non-ethnic elders aged 80 and above. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a broad range of self-management programs may provide benefits for older adults with chronic pain. Research is needed to establish the efficacy of the programs in diverse age and ethnic groups of older adults and identify strategies that maximize program reach, retention, and methods to ensure continued use of the strategies over time.

18343200	Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and yoga for drug-refractory epilepsy: a randomized controlled trial.	OBJECTIVE: There is a need for controlled outcome studies on behavioral treatment of epilepsy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and yoga in the treatment of epilepsy. METHODS: The design consisted of a randomized controlled trial with repeated measures (N=18). All participants had an EEG-verified epilepsy diagnosis with drug-refractory seizures. Participants were randomized into one of two groups: ACT or yoga. Therapeutic effects were measured using seizure index (frequency x duration) and quality of life (Satisfaction with Life Scale, WHOQOL-BREF). The treatment protocols consisted of 12 hours of professional therapy distributed in two individual sessions, two group sessions during a 5-week period, and booster sessions at 6 and 12 months posttreatment. Seizure index was continuously assessed during the 3-month baseline and 12-month follow-up. Quality of life was measured after treatment and at the 6-month and 1-year follow-ups. RESULTS: The results indicate that both ACT and yoga significantly reduce seizure index and increase quality of life over time. ACT reduced seizure index significantly more as compared with yoga. Participants in both the ACT and yoga groups improved their quality of life significantly as measured by one of two quality-of-life instruments. The ACT group increased their quality of life significantly as compared with the yoga group as measured by the WHOQOL-BREF, and the yoga group increased their quality of life significantly as compared with the ACT group as measured by the SWLS. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that complementary treatments, such as ACT and yoga, decrease seizure index and increase quality of life.

18336440	Mind-body interventions during pregnancy.	OBJECTIVE: To examine published evidence on the effectiveness of mind-body interventions during pregnancy on perceived stress, mood, and perinatal outcomes. DATA SOURCES: Computerized searches of PubMed, Cinahl, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library. STUDY SELECTION: Twelve out of 64 published intervention studies between 1980 and February 2007 of healthy, adult pregnant women met criteria for review. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Studies were categorized by type of mind-body modality used. Progressive muscle relaxation was the most common intervention. Other studies used a multimodal psychoeducation approach or a yoga and meditation intervention. The research contained methodological problems, primarily absence of a randomized control group or failure to adequately control confounding variables. Nonetheless, there was modest evidence for the efficacy of mind-body modalities during pregnancy. Treatment group outcomes included higher birthweight, shorter length of labor, fewer instrument-assisted births, and reduced perceived stress and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that pregnant women have health benefits from mind-body therapies used in conjunction with conventional prenatal care. Further research is necessary to build on these studies in order to predict characteristics of subgroups that might benefit from mind-body practices and examine cost effectiveness of these interventions on perinatal outcomes.

18319369	A preliminary investigation of the effects of giving testimony and learning yogic breathing techniques on battered women's feelings of depression.	Researchers have shown that mood and sense of control over one's life are significantly affected by testimony and other forms of disclosure and that learning to control breathing has positive effects on mood and anxiety. This preliminary experiment tests whether African American and European American abused women who give testimony about their experiences of intimate partner violence and learn how to use yogic breathing techniques have reduced feelings of depression. Results indicate that learning yogic breathing techniques alone and combined with giving testimony significantly reduces feelings of depression. Recasting women as authorities on domestic violence and teaching them how to calm their minds by focusing on yogic breathing may be simple and effective ways to help women take control over their bodies and lives.

18317923	Cardiorespiratory and metabolic changes during yoga sessions: the effects of respiratory exercises and meditation practices.	The novelty of this study was to investigate the changes in cardiorespiratory and metabolic intensity brought about by the practice of pranayamas (breathing exercises of yoga) and meditation during the same hatha-yoga session. The technique applied was the one advocated by the hatha-yoga system. Nine yoga instructors-five females and four males, mean age of 44+/-11, 6, were subjected to analysis of the gases expired during three distinct periods of 30 min: rest, respiratory exercises and meditative practice. A metabolic open circuit computerized system was applied (VO2000, MedGraphics-USA). The oxygen uptake (VO(2)) and the carbon dioxide output (VCO(2)) were statistically different (P <or= 0.05) during meditation and pranayama practices when compared with rest. The heart rate also suffered relevant reductions when results at rest were compared with those during meditation. A smaller proportion of lipids was metabolized during meditation practice compared with rest. The results suggest that the meditation used in this study reduces the metabolic rate whereas the specific pranayama technique in this study increases it when compared with the rest state.

18317191	Normative segment-specific axial and coronal angulation corridors of subaxial cervical column in axial rotation.	STUDY DESIGN: In contrast to clinical studies wherein loading magnitudes are indeterminate, experiments permit controlled and quantifiable moment applications, record kinematics in multiple planes, and allow derivation of moment-angulation corridors. Axial and coronal moment-angulation corridors were determined at every level of the subaxial cervical spine, expressed as logarithmic functions, and level-specificity of range of motion and neutral zones were evaluated. OBJECTIVE: HYPOTHESIS: segmental primary axial and coupled coronal motions do not vary by level. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although it is known that cervical spine responses are coupled, segment-specific corridors of axial and coronal kinematics under axial twisting moments from healthy normal spines are not reported. METHODS: Ten human cadaver columns (23-44 years, mean: 34 +/- 6.8) were fixed at the ends and targets were inserted to each vertebra to obtain kinematics in axial and coronal planes. The columns were subjected to pure axial twisting moments. Range of motion and neutral zone for primary-axial and coupled-coronal rotation components were determined at each spinal level. Data were analyzed using factorial analysis of variance. Moment-rotation angulations were expressed using logarithmic functions, and mean +/-1 standard deviation corridors were derived at each level for both components. RESULTS: Moment-angulations responses were nonlinear. Each segmental curve for both components was well represented by a logarithmic function (r2 > 0.95). Factorial analysis of variance indicated that the biomechanical metrics are spinal level-specific (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Axial and coronal angulations of cervical spinal columns show statistically different level-specific responses. The presentation of moment-angulation corridors for both metrics forms a dataset for the normal population. These segment-specific nonlinear corridors may help clinicians assess dysfunction or instability. These data will assist mathematical models of the spine in improved validation and lead to efficacious design of stabilizing systems.

19468897	Yoga and pilates in the management of low back pain.	Many interventions for the management of low back pain exist, however most have modest efficacy at best, and there are few with clearly demonstrated benefits once pain becomes chronic. Therapeutic exercise, on the other hand, does appear to have significant benefits for managing patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) in terms of decreasing pain and improving function. In addition, because chronic pain is complex and does not fit a simple model, there have also been numerous trials investigating and demonstrating the efficacy of multidisciplinary pain programs for CLBP. It follows that interventions that treat more than one aspect of LBP would have significant benefits for this patient population. Yoga and Pilates which have, both been gaining in popularity over the last decade are two mind-body exercise interventions that address both the physical and mental aspects of pain with core strengthening, flexibility, and relaxation. There has been a slow evolution of these nontraditional exercise regimens into treatment paradigms for LBP, although few studies examining their effects have been published. The following article will focus on the scientific and theoretical basis of using yoga and Pilates in the management of CLBP.	Sorosky, Susan;Stilp, Sonja;Akuthota, Venu	2008 Mar
18300936	Therapeutic effects of yoga for children: a systematic review of the literature.	PURPOSE: We completed a systematic review of the literature on the effect of yoga on quality of life and physical outcome measures in the pediatric population. We explored various databases and included case-control and pilot studies, cohort and randomized controlled trials that examined yoga as an exercise intervention for children. SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS: Using the Sackett levels of evidence, this article reviews the literature on yoga as a complementary mind-body movement therapy. We address the research through three practice patterns according to the Guide to Physical Therapist Practice and provide considerations for the inclusion of yoga into clinical practice. STATEMENT OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: The evidence shows physiological benefits of yoga for the pediatric population that may benefit children through the rehabilitation process, but larger clinical trials, including specific measures of quality of life are necessary to provide definitive evidence.

18299208	EEG paroxysmal gamma waves during Bhramari Pranayama: a yoga breathing technique.	Here we report that a specific form of yoga can generate controlled high-frequency gamma waves. For the first time, paroxysmal gamma waves (PGW) were observed in eight subjects practicing a yoga technique of breathing control called Bhramari Pranayama (BhPr). To obtain new insights into the nature of the EEG during BhPr, we analyzed EEG signals using time-frequency representations (TFR), independent component analysis (ICA), and EEG tomography (LORETA). We found that the PGW consists of high-frequency biphasic ripples. This unusual activity is discussed in relation to previous reports on yoga and meditation. It is concluded this EEG activity is most probably non-epileptic, and that applying the same methodology to other meditation recordings might yield an improved understanding of the neurocorrelates of meditation.

18286369	Integrating a portable biofeedback device into clinical practice for patients with anxiety disorders: results of a pilot study.	This study examined the effectiveness of a portable Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA) biofeedback device as an adjunct to CBT in persons with anxiety disorders and other disorders associated with autonomic dysfunction attending outpatient treatment. Participants were 24 individuals attending outpatient cognitive behavioral treatment for a range of anxiety disorders. Participants were assessed over a 3 week period. Outcomes included measures of anxiety (STAI-Y), sleep disturbances (PSQI), anger (STAEI), and subjective questions about the effectiveness of the device as a treatment adjunct. Significant reductions were found for anxiety and anger and for certain sleep variables (e.g. sleep latency). There was a significant dos-effect in that those who were more compliant had significantly greater reductions in most domains including sleep, anger and trait anxiety. Overall, participants found the device more helpful than other relaxation techniques such as mediation, yoga and unassisted breathing techniques but less helpful than exercise. The most frequently endorsed side effects were dizziness (15%) and sleepiness (55%). These preliminary results suggest that portable RSA biofeedback appears to be a promising treatment adjunct for disorders of autonomic arousal and is easily integrated into treatment. Results support the need for further investigation with more rigorous experimental designs.	Reiner, Robert	2008 Mar
18280906	Siddha medicine--background and principles and the application for skin diseases.	Siddha medicine is one of the most ancient medical systems of India. Siddha is the mother medicine of ancient Tamils/Dravidians of peninsular South India. The word Siddha means established truth. The persons who were associated with establishing such a Siddha school of thought were known as Siddhars. They recorded their mystic findings in medicine, yoga, and astrology in Tamil. Fundamental Principles of Siddha include theories of Five Elements (Aimpootham), and Three Forces/Faults (Mukkuttram). The Eight Methods of Examination (Envakai Thervukal) is used to determine diagnosis, etiology, treatment and prognosis. Siddha has safe herbal and herbo mineral treatment for psoriasis, eczema, alopecia, diabetic ulcer, warts, vitiligo, pemphigus, pompholyx, leprosy, and many more very common and rare diseases. Lifestyle modifications including diet are important.	Thas, J Joseph	2008 Jan-Feb
18271780	Reported effects of non-traditional treatments and complementary and alternative medicine by retinitis pigmentosa patients.	BACKGROUND: Benefits of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)-related interventions have been demonstrated for patients with chronic, systemic diseases in which stress, anxiety and disability are prevalent. Subjects with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) commonly indicate that they have 'good' and 'bad' vision days, stating that stress causes a decrease in vision and that vision improves when the stress is alleviated. We assessed CAM use by RP patients and its perceived effectiveness. METHODS: We enquired about nine CAM areas: meditation, mind-body therapies, yoga, movement therapies, energy therapies, acupuncture, massage therapy, spirituality/religion and herbal therapies/aromatherapy. Ninety-six RP patients with any level of vision completed an anonymous internet survey. RESULTS: Ninety-five per cent of respondents tried at least one of the nine CAM areas. Seventy-five per cent have used nutritional supplements, including lutein (47 per cent), bilberry (32), vitamin A palmitate (36) and docosahexaenoic acid (23 per cent). Some tried meditation (47) and yoga (31 per cent). Stress and anxiety levels were reported as improved in 93, 92 and 87 per cent of those who used yoga, meditation and mind-body therapies, respectively. Many of those who tried mind-body therapies (40) or acupuncture (50 per cent), used it with a desire to fight RP. Vision was subjectively affected in 65 per cent of acupuncture users and from 20 to 35 per cent of the users of the other CAM areas. Those who indicated that their vision was affected by at least one type of CAM (35 per cent) were statistically significantly more likely to require magnification to read (that is, they had lost more vision and RP had progressed), than those who did not believe vision was impacted (59 versus 84 per cent). CONCLUSIONS: RP patients are using CAM and are experiencing some impact on vision and physical/emotional well-being. Clinicians and researchers should be aware of its use. Clinical trials with CAM interventions are necessary to attempt to validate these findings.	Kiser, Ava K;Dagnelie, Gislin	2008 Mar
18258582	Integrating yoga into cancer care.	Although yoga has been practiced in Eastern culture for thousands of years as part of life philosophy, classes in the United States only recently have been offered to people with cancer. The word yoga is derived from the Sanskrit root yuj, meaning to bind, join, and yoke. This reflection of the union of the body, mind, and spirit is what differentiates yoga from general exercise programs. Yoga classes in the United States generally consist of asanas (postures), which are designed to exercise every muscle, nerve, and gland in the body. The postures are combined with pranayama, or rhythmic control of the breath. As a complementary therapy, yoga integrates awareness of breath, relaxation, exercise, and social support--elements that are key to enhancing quality of life in patients with cancer. Yoga practice may assist cancer survivors in managing symptoms such as depression, anxiety, insomnia, pain, and fatigue. As with all exercise programs, participants need to be aware of potential risks and their own limitations. The purpose of this article is to familiarize nurses with yoga as a complementary therapy, including current research findings, types of yoga, potential benefits, safety concerns, teacher training, and ways to integrate yoga into cancer care.

18254519	Complementary and alternative medicine use in rheumatoid arthritis: an audit of patients visiting a tertiary care centre.	BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) enjoys widespread popularity in chronic illnesses such as rheumatic diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the commonest inflammatory joint disease seen in clinical practice. No systematic study on the use of CAM by patients with RA is available from northern India. METHODS: We evaluated the prevalence and usage characteristics of CAM in Indian patients with RA using a questionnaire at a tertiary care centre in northern India. RESULTS: Of the 102 patients with RA included in the study, 39% reported current CAM use. As many as 84 respondents (82%) reported having tried CAM during the course of their disease. A total of 215 CAM courses were used, out of which 77 were being continued. Ayurveda was the commonest (28% courses) followed by homoeopathy (20%), yoga asana (17%) and pranayama (12%). Pain control was the primary reason for using CAM (69% of users). Most CAM therapies (78%) were started on the advice of friends and relatives. Discontinuation of CAM was attributed to lack of clinical benefit (78%) and adverse effects (10%). Of the patients using CAM, 87% did not reveal its use to their physicians, primarily because the physician did not enquire about it. CONCLUSION: Patients with RA frequently use CAM for pain control. These practices are often not revealed to the treating physician. Knowledge of the concurrent use of CAM may serve to alert the physician about potential side-effects or drug interactions.

18237457	Effects of mindful and non-mindful exercises on people with depression: a systematic review.	PURPOSE: An emerging body of evidence has shown the therapeutic effect of both mindful and non-mindful physical exercises on the treatment of depression. The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of mindful and non-mindful physical exercises as an intervention in managing depression or depressive symptoms based on a systematic literature review. METHODS: Our review was conducted among five electronic databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which tested the effects of mindful or/and non-mindful physical exercises on depression. Studies were classified according to the baseline depression status of participants and its relation to allocation concealment, blinding at outcome assessment, follow-up, and whether intention to treat analysis was employed. RESULTS: The results based on 12 RCTs indicated that both the mindful and non-mindful physical exercises were effective in their short-term effect in reducing depression levels or depressive symptoms. However, most of studies had methodological problems that only small sample size was used, and the maintenance effects of physical exercise were not reported. Specific comparisons between RCTs on mindful and non-mindful exercises were not performed because of the limitations on the designs. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that more well-controlled studies have to be conducted in the future to address the short- and long-term effects of physical exercise on alleviating depression. Efforts should be focused on unveiling the differential effects of mindful and non-mindful exercises on depression and the underlying mechanisms of their therapeutic action.

18227920	A phase I feasibility study of yoga on the physical health and coping of informal caregivers.	Family and friends who provide unpaid care to an individual with a disease or disability (known as informal caregivers) experience numerous threats to their physical health as a result of providing care. In spite of evidence that participation in physical and leisure activities can be health promoting, informal caregivers have reported diminished or completely absent leisure participation. Hatha yoga has documented therapeutic benefits, including reduced anxiety, as well as improved muscle strength and endurance and flexibility. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of conducting an 8-week yoga program with informal caregivers, and to gather pilot data on the effects of yoga on the physical fitness and coping of informal caregivers. Caregivers were randomized into a yoga intervention (n = 8) or control group (n = 9). The yoga sessions were 2.5 hours/week for 8 weeks and consisted of a variety of pranayama (breathing) and asana (postures) activities and were led by a certified yoga instructor. Four caregivers (two in each group) dropped out of the study. After the conclusion of the 8-week yoga program, lower body strength increased significantly for those in the yoga group and other notable trends occurred in terms of coping, upper body strength and aerobic endurance. Caregivers in the control group experienced an unexpected increase in lower body flexibility. These findings indicate that caregivers in a yoga program may receive some benefits. Future studies are encouraged to test the efficacy of yoga as an intervention for caregivers.	Van Puymbroeck, Marieke;Payne, Laura L;Hsieh, Pei-Chun	2007 Dec
18227919	Iyengar yoga increases cardiac parasympathetic nervous modulation among healthy yoga practitioners.	Relaxation techniques are established in managing of cardiac patients during rehabilitation aiming to reduce future adverse cardiac events. It has been hypothesized that relaxation-training programs may significantly improve cardiac autonomic nervous tone. However, this has not been proven for all available relaxation techniques. We tested this assumption by investigating cardiac vagal modulation during yoga.We examined 11 healthy yoga practitioners (7 women and 4 men, mean age: 43 +/- 11; range: 26-58 years). Each individual was subjected to training units of 90 min once a week over five successive weeks. During two sessions, they practiced a yoga program developed for cardiac patients by B.K.S. Iyengar. On three sessions, they practiced a placebo program of relaxation. On each training day they underwent ambulatory 24 h Holter monitoring. The group of yoga practitioners was compared to a matched group of healthy individuals not practicing any relaxation techniques. Parameters of heart rate variability (HRV) were determined hourly by a blinded observer. Mean RR interval (interval between two R-waves of the ECG) was significantly higher during the time of yoga intervention compared to placebo and to control (P < 0.001 for both). The increase in HRV parameters was significantly higher during yoga exercise than during placebo and control especially for the parameters associated with vagal tone, i.e. mean standard deviation of NN (Normal Beat to Normal Beat of the ECG) intervals for all 5-min intervals (SDNNi, P < 0.001 for both) and root mean square successive difference (rMSSD, P < 0.01 for both). In conclusion, relaxation by yoga training is associated with a significant increase of cardiac vagal modulation. Since this method is easy to apply with no side effects, it could be a suitable intervention in cardiac rehabilitation programs.

18227918	Yoga reduces symptoms of distress in tsunami survivors in the andaman islands.	A month after the December 2004 tsunami the effect of a 1 week yoga program was evaluated on self rated fear, anxiety, sadness and disturbed sleep in 47 survivors in the Andaman Islands. Polygraph recordings of the heart rate, breath rate and skin resistance were also made. Among the 47 people, 31 were settlers from the mainland (i.e. India, ML group) and 16 were endogenous people (EP group). There was a significant decrease in self rated fear, anxiety, sadness and disturbed sleep in both groups, and in the heart and breath rate in the ML group, and in the breath rate alone in the EP group, following yoga (P < 0.05, t-test). This suggests that yoga practice may be useful in the management of stress following a natural disaster in people with widely differing social, cultural and spiritual beliefs.

18227917	Yoga as a complementary treatment of depression: effects of traits and moods on treatment outcome.	Preliminary findings support the potential of yoga as a complementary treatment of depressed patients who are taking anti-depressant medications but who are only in partial remission. The purpose of this article is to present further data on the intervention, focusing on individual differences in psychological, emotional and biological processes affecting treatment outcome. Twenty-seven women and 10 men were enrolled in the study, of whom 17 completed the intervention and pre- and post-intervention assessment data. The intervention consisted of 20 classes led by senior Iyengar yoga teachers, in three courses of 20 yoga classes each. All participants were diagnosed with unipolar major depression in partial remission. Psychological and biological characteristics were assessed pre- and post-intervention, and participants rated their mood states before and after each class. Significant reductions were shown for depression, anger, anxiety, neurotic symptoms and low frequency heart rate variability in the 17 completers. Eleven out of these completers achieved remission levels post-intervention. Participants who remitted differed from the non-remitters at intake on several traits and on physiological measures indicative of a greater capacity for emotional regulation. Moods improved from before to after the yoga classes. Yoga appears to be a promising intervention for depression; it is cost-effective and easy to implement. It produces many beneficial emotional, psychological and biological effects, as supported by observations in this study. The physiological methods are especially useful as they provide objective markers of the processes and effectiveness of treatment. These observations may help guide further clinical application of yoga in depression and other mental health disorders, and future research on the processes and mechanisms.

18227916	A review of yoga programs for four leading risk factors of chronic diseases.	Yoga, a form of physical activity, is rapidly gaining in popularity and has many health benefits. Yet healthcare providers have been slow to recognize yoga for its ability to improve health conditions, and few interventions have been developed that take full advantage of its benefits. The purpose of this article is to review published studies using yoga programs and to determine the effect of yoga interventions on common risk factors of chronic diseases (overweight, hypertension, high glucose level and high cholesterol). A systematic search yielded 32 articles published between 1980 and April 2007. The studies found that yoga interventions are generally effective in reducing body weight, blood pressure, glucose level and high cholesterol, but only a few studies examined long-term adherence. Additionally, not enough studies included diverse populations at high risk for diabetes and its related common health problems.	Yang, Kyeongra	2007 Dec
18227915	The influence of yoga-based programs on risk profiles in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review.	There is growing evidence that yoga may offer a safe and cost-effective intervention for Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (DM 2). However, systematic reviews are lacking. This article critically reviews the published literature regarding the effects of yoga-based programs on physiologic and anthropometric risk profiles and related clinical outcomes in adults with DM 2. We performed a comprehensive literature search using four computerized English and Indian scientific databases. The search was restricted to original studies (1970-2006) that evaluated the metabolic and clinical effects of yoga in adults with DM 2. Studies targeting clinical populations with cardiovascular disorders that included adults with comorbid DM were also evaluated. Data were extracted regarding study design, setting, target population, intervention, comparison group or condition, outcome assessment, data analysis and presentation, follow-up, and key results, and the quality of each study was evaluated according to specific predetermined criteria. We identified 25 eligible studies, including 15 uncontrolled trials, 6 non-randomized controlled trials and 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Overall, these studies suggest beneficial changes in several risk indices, including glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, lipid profiles, anthropometric characteristics, blood pressure, oxidative stress, coagulation profiles, sympathetic activation and pulmonary function, as well as improvement in specific clinical outcomes. Yoga may improve risk profiles in adults with DM 2, and may have promise for the prevention and management of cardiovascular complications in this population. However, the limitations characterizing most studies preclude drawing firm conclusions. Additional high-quality RCTs are needed to confirm and further elucidate the effects of standardized yoga programs in populations with DM 2.	Innes, Kim E;Vincent, Heather K	2007 Dec
18227907	Complementary and alternative approaches to pain relief during labor.	This review evaluated the effect of complementary and alternative medicine on pain during labor with conventional scientific methods using electronic data bases through 2006 were used. Only randomized controlled trials with outcome measures for labor pain were kept for the conclusions. Many studies did not meet the scientific inclusion criteria. According to the randomized control trials, we conclude that for the decrease of labor pain and/or reduction of the need for conventional analgesic methods: (i) There is an efficacy found for acupressure and sterile water blocks. (ii) Most results favored some efficacy for acupuncture and hydrotherapy. (iii) Studies for other complementary or alternative therapies for labor pain control have not shown their effectiveness.

18226247	The influence of physical activity and yoga on central arterial stiffness.	PURPOSE: Central arterial stiffness is an accepted risk factor for cardiovascular disease. While aerobic activity is associated with reduced stiffness the influence of practicing yoga is unknown. The aims of this study were to: 1) evaluate arterial stiffness in middle-aged adults who regularly practiced yoga, performed regular exercise, or were inactive, 2) evaluate the reproducibility of arterial stiffness measured in the left and right carotid artery and by pulse wave velocity (PWV). METHODS: Twenty six healthy subjects (male and female, 40-65 yrs old) were tested on two separate days. Carotid artery distensibility (DC) was measured with ultrasound. Physical activity was determined by questionnaire. RESULTS: Yoga and aerobic subjects had similar physical activity levels. Yoga and aerobic groups were not different in either DC (p = 0.26) or PWV (p = 0.21). The sedentary group had lower DC and higher PWV compared to the aerobic and yoga groups (both, p < 0.001). Stiffness measures were reliable day to day (coefficients of variation approximately 2.5%) and similar between left and right arteries (CV = 2.2%). CONCLUSION: Physical activity was a strong predictor of both measures of arterial stiffness, although other factors such as nutritional status need to be accounted for. An independent effect of practicing yoga could not be detected. Stiffness measures were reproducible and left and right sides were consistent with each other.

18218131	Unusual presentation of hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies.	BACKGROUND: Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an autosomal-dominant painless peripheral neuropathy characterized by episodes of repeated focal pressure neuropathies at sites of entrapment/compression, with a considerable variability in the clinical course. Electrodiagnostic and genetic testing are important in the diagnostic evaluation of these patients. CASE PRESENTATION: We report an unusual HNPP phenotype, five compression neuropathies in four nerves in a patient with bilateral hand numbness. A 42-year-old female, presented with acute bilateral paresthesias and weakness in her hands after starting yoga exercises requiring hyperextension of her hands at the wrists. Her presentation was complicated by: a) a remote history of acute onset foot drop and subsequent improvement, b) previous diagnoses of demyelinating peripheral neuropathy, possibly Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, and c) exposure to leprosy. Electrodiagnostic testing showed 5 separate compression neuropathies in 4 nerves including: severe left and right ulnar neuropathies at the wrist, left and right median neuropathies at the wrist and left ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. There was a mild generalized, primarily demyelinating, peripheral polyneuropathy. Based on the clinical suspicion and electrodiagnostic findings, consistent with profound demyelination in areas of compression, genetic analysis was done which identified a deletion of the PMP-22 gene consistent with HNPP. CONCLUSION: HNPP can present with unusual phenotypes, such as 5 separate mononeuropathies, bilateral ulnar and median neuropathies at the wrists and ulnar neuropathy at the elbow with mild peripheral demyelinating polyneuropathy associated with the PMP-22 gene deletion.

18175646	Introduction to Garudapurana with reference to Ayurveda.	The Puranas are the encyclopedic works of the ancient and medieval Hindu religion, philosophy, history, politics, ethics, sciences etc. There are 18 (Astadasa) puranas, which are, considered as mahapuranas, among which Garudapurana is popular one. The Garudapurana is divided into two parts viz., Purvakhanda and Uttarakhanda. The first part, which is also called Acarakhanda consists of 240 chapters. The greater part of the Purvakhanda occupies the descriptions of Vratas (religious observances), sacred places dedicated to the Surya (sun), Lord Siva and Lord Visnu. It also contains treatises on various aspects like astrology, palmistry, politics, Sankhya, Yoga, anatomy, precious stones and extensive information on vedic medicine i.e., Ayurveda. The Uttarakhanda consists of two khandas viz. Dharmakhanda and Brahmakhanda, which are divided into 42 and 29 chapters, respectively. The Dharmakhanda is also known as the Pretakalpa which contains directions for the performance of obsequies rites. The Pretakalpa portion of the Garudapurana is generally recited during the period of mourning and so its importance is self-evident. It is almost impossible to narrate within such a small framework, the wide range of splendid truths scattered in the pages of this noble puranam. Little information is available from internal evidence to establish its exact period. However, it is supposed to be quite ancient in its origin.

18175644	Requirement of scientific documentation for the development of Naturopathy.	Past few decades have witnessed explosion of knowledge in almost every field. This has resulted not only in the advancement of the subjects in particular but also have influenced the growth of various allied subjects. The present paper explains about the advancement of science through efforts made in specific areas and also through discoveries in different allied fields having an indirect influence upon the subject in proper. In Naturopathy this seems that though nothing particular is added to the basic thoughts or fundamental principles of the subject yet the entire treatment understanding is revolutionised under the influence of scientific discoveries of past few decades. Advent of information technology has further added to the boom of knowledge and many times this seems impossible to utilize these informations for the good of human being because these are not logically arranged in our minds. In the above background, the author tries to define documentation stating that we have today ocean of information and knowledge about various things- living or dead, plants, animals or human beings; the geographical conditions or changing weather and environment. What required to be done is to extract the relevant knowledge and information required to enrich the subject. The author compares documentation with churning of milk to extract butter. Documentation, in fact, is churning of ocean of information to extract the specific, most appropriate, relevant and defined information and knowledge related to the particular subject . The paper besides discussing the definition of documentation, highlights the areas of Naturopathy requiring an urgent necessity to make proper documentations. Paper also discusses the present status of Naturopathy in India, proposes short-term and long-term goals to be achieved and plans the strategies for achieving them. The most important aspect of the paper is due understanding of the limitations of Naturopathy but a constant effort to improve the same with the growth made in various discipline of science so far.

18166122	Effects of yoga and the addition of Tui Na in patients with fibromyalgia.	OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to verify whether techniques of yoga with and without the addition of Tui Na might improve pain and the negative impact of fibromyalgia (FMS) on patients' daily life. DESIGN: Forty (40) FMS women were randomized into two groups, Relaxing Yoga (RY) and Relaxing Yoga plus Touch (RYT), for eight weekly sessions of stretching, breathing, and relaxing yogic techniques. RYT patients were further submitted to manipulative techniques of Tui Na. OUTCOME MEASURE: Outcome measures comprised the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), pain threshold at the 18 FMS tender points, and a verbal graduation of pain assessed before treatment and on the followup. The visual analog scale (VAS) for pain was assessed before and after each session and on the follow-up. RESULTS: Seventeen (17) RYT and 16 RY patients completed the study. Both RY and RYT groups showed improvement in the FIQ and VAS scores, which decreased on all sessions. The RYT group showed lower VAS and verbal scores for pain on the eighth session, but this difference was not maintained on the follow-up. Conversely, RY VAS and verbal scores were significantly lower just on the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: These study results showed that yogic techniques are valid therapeutic methods for FMS. Touch addition yielded greater improvement during the treatment. Over time, however, RY patients reported less pain than RYT. These results suggest that a passive therapy may possibly decrease control over FMS symptoms.	da Silva, Gerson D;Lorenzi-Filho, Geraldo;Lage, Lais V	2007 Dec
18166119	Improvement of glutathione and total antioxidant status with yoga.	OBJECTIVE: Several studies suggest that yoga can decrease oxidative stress. However reports are scanty regarding whether yoga training can improve the glutathione level of individual. This study is designed to appraise the role of yoga in maintaining glutathione (reduced and oxidized) levels and antioxidant status. STUDY DESIGN: This study was conducted on healthy male volunteers from the Indian Navy, who were divided into two groups--a yoga (n = 30) group and a control (n = 21) group. The yoga group was trained in yoga for 6 months. The yoga schedule consisted of prayers, asana, pranayama, and meditation. The control group practiced routine physical training exercise for 6 months. Blood samples were collected when the volunteers were in fasting condition before and after completion of 6-month training period. Reduced and oxidized glutathione, glutathione reductase activity and total antioxidant status (TAS) were estimated. RESULTS: Reduced glutathione level increased significantly (p < 0.05) in the yoga group after completion of training. Glutathione reductase activity increased significantly in the control group (p < 0.05). TAS increased significantly (p < 0.001) in the yoga group and decreased significantly (p < 0.001) in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Regular practice of yoga can maintain or improve antioxidant level of the body. The clinical relevance is that yoga practice can be used to maintain the antioxidant defense system under stressful conditions of training as observed in the case of soldiers and athletes.

22013359	Diseases of poverty and lifestyle, well-being and human development.	The problems of the haves differ substantially from those of the have-nots. Individuals in developing societies have to fight mainly against infectious and communicable diseases, while in the developed world the battles are mainly against lifestyle diseases. Yet, at a very fundamental level, the problems are the same-the fight is against distress, disability, and premature death; against human exploitation and for human development and self-actualisation; against the callousness to critical concerns in regimes and scientific power centres.While there has been great progress in the treatment of individual diseases, human pathology continues to increase. Sicknesses are not decreasing in number, they are only changing in type.The primary diseases of poverty like TB, malaria, and HIV/AIDS-and the often co-morbid and ubiquitous malnutrition-take their toll on helpless populations in developing countries. Poverty is not just income deprivation but capability deprivation and optimism deprivation as well.While life expectancy may have increased in the haves, and infant and maternal mortality reduced, these gains have not necessarily ensured that well-being results. There are ever-multiplying numbers of individuals whose well-being is compromised due to lifestyle diseases. These diseases are the result of faulty lifestyles and the consequent crippling stress. But it serves no one's purpose to understand them as such. So, the prescription pad continues to prevail over lifestyle-change counselling or research.The struggle to achieve well-being and positive health, to ensure longevity, to combat lifestyle stress and professional burnout, and to reduce psychosomatic ailments continues unabated, with hardly an end in sight.WE THUS REALISE THAT MORBIDITY, DISABILITY, AND DEATH ASSAIL ALL THREE SOCIETIES: the ones with infectious diseases, the ones with diseases of poverty, and the ones with lifestyle diseases. If it is bacteria in their various forms that are the culprit in infectious diseases, it is poverty/deprivation in its various manifestations that is the culprit in poverty-related diseases, and it is lifestyle stress in its various avatars that is the culprit in lifestyle diseases. It is as though poverty and lifestyle stress have become the modern "bacteria" of developing and developed societies, respectively.For those societies afflicted with diseases of poverty, of course, the prime concern is to escape from the deadly grip of poverty-disease-deprivation-helplessness; but, while so doing, they must be careful not to land in the lap of lifestyle diseases. For the haves, the need is to seek well-being, positive health, and inner rootedness; to ask science not only to give them new pills for new ills, but to define and study how negative emotions hamper health and how positive ones promote it; to find out what is inner peace, what is the connection between spirituality and health, what is well-being, what is self-actualisation, what prevents disease, what leads to longevity, how simplicity impacts health, what attitudes help cope with chronic sicknesses, how sicknesses can be reversed (not just treated), etc. Studies on well-being, longevity, and simplicity need the concerted attention of researchers.THE TASK AHEAD IS CUT OUT FOR EACH ONE OF US: physician, patient, caregiver, biomedical researcher, writer/journalist, science administrator, policy maker, ethicist, man of religion, practitioner of alternate/complementary medicine, citizen of a world community, etc. Each one must do his or her bit to ensure freedom from disease and achieve well-being.Those in the developed world have the means to make life meaningful but, often, have lost the meaning of life itself; those in the developing world are fighting for survival but, often, have recipes to make life meaningful. This is especially true of a society like India, which is rapidly emerging from its underdeveloped status. It is an ancient civilization, with a philosophical outlook based on a robust mix of the temporal and the spiritual, with vibrant indigenous biomedical and related disciplines, for example, Ayurveda, Yoga, etc. It also has a burgeoning corpus of modern biomedical knowledge in active conversation with the rest of the world. It should be especially careful that, while it does not negate the fruits of economic development and scientific/biomedical advance that seem to beckon it in this century, it does not also forget the values that have added meaning and purpose to life; values that the ancients bequeathed it, drawn from their experiential knowledge down the centuries.The means that the developed have could combine with the recipes to make them meaningful that the developing have. That is the challenge ahead for mankind as it gropes its way out of poverty, disease, despair, alienation, anomie, and the ubiquitous all-devouring lifestyle stresses, and takes halting steps towards well-being and the glory of human development.

21829282	Influence of yoga on postoperative outcomes and wound healing in early operable breast cancer patients undergoing surgery.	CONTEXT: Pre- and postoperative distress in breast cancer patients can cause complications and delay recovery from surgery. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of yoga intervention on postoperative outcomes and wound healing in early operable breast cancer patients undergoing surgery. METHODS: Ninety-eight recently diagnosed stage II and III breast cancer patients were recruited in a randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of a yoga program with supportive therapy and exercise rehabilitation on postoperative outcomes and wound healing following surgery. Subjects were assessed at the baseline prior to surgery and four weeks later. Sociodemographic, clinical and investigative notes were ascertained in the beginning of the study. Blood samples were collected for estimation of plasma cytokines-soluble Interleukin (IL)-2 receptor (IL-2R), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interferon (IFN)-gamma. Postoperative outcomes such as the duration of hospital stay and drain retention, time of suture removal and postoperative complications were ascertained. We used independent samples t test and nonparametric Mann Whitney U tests to compare groups for postoperative outcomes and plasma cytokines. Regression analysis was done to determine predictors for postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients contributed data to the current analysis (yoga: n = 33, control: n = 36). The results suggest a significant decrease in the duration of hospital stay (P = 0.003), days of drain retention (P = 0.001) and days for suture removal (P = 0.03) in the yoga group as compared to the controls. There was also a significant decrease in plasma TNF alpha levels following surgery in the yoga group (P < 0.001), as compared to the controls. Regression analysis on postoperative outcomes showed that the yoga intervention affected the duration of drain retention and hospital stay as well as TNF alpha levels. CONCLUSION: The results suggest possible benefits of yoga in reducing postoperative complications in breast cancer patients.

21829281	Long-term effect of yogic practices on diurnal metabolic rates of healthy subjects.	BACKGROUND: The metabolic rate is an indicator of autonomic activity. Reduced sympathetic arousal probably resulting in hypometabolic states has been reported in several yogic studies. AIM: The main objective of this study was to assess the effect of yoga training on diurnal metabolic rates in yoga practitioners at two different times of the day (at 6 a.m. and 9 p.m.). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty eight healthy volunteers were selected and their metabolic rates assessed at 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. using an indirect calorimeter at a yoga school in Bangalore, India. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the average metabolic rate of the yoga group was 12% lower than that of the non-yoga group (P < 0.001) measured at 9 p.m. and 16% lower at 6 a.m. (P < 0.001). The 9 p.m. metabolic rates of the yoga group were almost equal to their predicted basal metabolic rates (BMRs) whereas the metabolic rate was significantly higher than the predicted BMR for the non-yoga group. The 6 a.m. metabolic rate was comparable to their predicted BMR in the non-yoga group whereas it was much lower in the yoga group (P < 0.001). The lower metabolic rates in the yoga group at 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. may be due to coping strategies for day-to-day stress, decreased sympathetic nervous system activity and probably, a stable autonomic nervous system response (to different stressors) achieved due to training in yoga.

21829280	Effect of yogic exercise on super oxide dismutase levels in diabetics.	CONTEXT: Reactive oxygen species are known to aggravate disease progression. To counteract their harmful effects, the body produces various antioxidant enzymes, viz, superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase etc. Literature reviews revealed that exercises help to enhance antioxidant enzyme systems; hence, yogic exercises may be useful to combat various diseases. AIMS: This study aims to record the efficacy of yoga on superoxide dismutase, glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb) and fasting blood glucose levels in diabetics. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Forty diabetics aged 40-55 years were assigned to experimental (30) and control (10) groups. The experimental subjects underwent a Yoga program comprising of various Asanas (isometric type exercises) and Pranayamas (breathing exercises) along with regular anti-diabetic therapy whereas the control group received anti-diabetic therapy only. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Heparinized blood samples were used to determine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glycosylated Hb levels and fasting blood specimens collected in fluoride Vacutainers were used for assessing blood glucose. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Data were analyzed by using 2 x 2 x 3 Factorial ANOVA followed by Scheffe's posthoc test. RESULTS: The results revealed that Yogic exercise enhanced the levels of Superoxide dismutase and reduced glycosylated Hb and glucose levels in the experimental group as compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: The findings conclude that Yogic exercises have enhanced the antioxidant defence mechanism in diabetics by reducing oxidative stress.	Mahapure, Hemant H;Shete, Sanjay U;Bera, T K	2008 Jan
21829279	Influence of yoga on mood states, distress, quality of life and immune outcomes in early stage breast cancer patients undergoing surgery.	CONTEXT: Breast cancer patients awaiting surgery experience heightened distress that could affect postoperative outcomes. AIMS: The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of yoga intervention on mood states, treatment-related symptoms, quality of life and immune outcomes in breast cancer patients undergoing surgery. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Ninety-eight recently diagnosed stage II and III breast cancer patients were recruited for a randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of a yoga program with supportive therapy plus exercise rehabilitation on postoperative outcomes following surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Subjects were assessed prior to surgery and four weeks thereafter. Psychometric instruments were used to assess self-reported anxiety, depression, treatment-related distress and quality of life. Blood samples were collected for enumeration of T lymphocyte subsets (CD4 %, CD8 % and natural killer (NK) cell % counts) and serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA and IgM). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: We used analysis of covariance to compare interventions postoperatively. RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients contributed data to the current analysis (yoga n = 33, control n = 36). The results suggest a significant decrease in the state (P = 0.04) and trait (P = 0.004) of anxiety, depression (P = 0.01), symptom severity (P = 0.01), distress (P < 0.01) and improvement in quality of life (P = 0.01) in the yoga group as compared to the controls. There was also a significantly lesser decrease in CD 56% (P = 0.02) and lower levels of serum IgA (P = 0.001) in the yoga group as compared to controls following surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest possible benefits for yoga in reducing postoperative distress and preventing immune suppression following surgery.

21829278	A randomized control trial of the effect of yoga on Gunas (personality) and Health in normal healthy volunteers.	OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy of yoga on Guna (yogic personality measure) and general health in normal adults. METHODS: Of the 1228 persons who attended introductory lectures, 226 subjects aged 18-71 years, of both sexes, who satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria and who consented to participate in the study were randomly allocated into two groups. The Yoga(Y) group practised an integrated yoga module that included asanas, pranayama, meditation, notional correction and devotional sessions. The control group practised mild to moderate physical exercises (PE). Both groups had supervised practice sessions (by trained experts) for one hour daily, six days a week for eight weeks. Guna (yogic personality) was assessed before and after eight weeks using the self-administered Vedic Personality Inventory (VPI) which assesses Sattva (gentle and controlled), Rajas (violent and uncontrolled) and Tamas (dull and uncontrolled). The general health status (total health), which includes four domains namely somatic symptoms (SS), anxiety and insomnia (AI), social dysfunction (SF) and severe depression (SP), was assessed using a General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). RESULTS: Baseline scores for all the domains for both the groups did not differ significantly (P > 0.05, independent samples t test). Sattva showed a significant difference within the groups and the effect size was more in the Y than in the PE group. Rajas showed a significant decrease within and between the groups with a higher effect size in the PE group. Tamas showed significant reduction within the PE group only. The GHQ revealed that there was significant decrease in SS, AI, SF and SP in both Y and PE groups (Wilcoxcon Singed Rank t test). SS showed a significant difference between the groups (Mann Whitney U Test). CONCLUSIONS: There was an improvement in Sattva in both the Yoga and control groups with a trend of higher effect size in Yoga; Rajas reduced in both but significantly better in PE than in Yoga and Tamas reduced in PE. The general health status improved in both the Yoga and control groups.	Deshpande, Sudheer;Nagendra, H R;Raghuram, Nagarathna	2008 Jan

19842301	Evaluation of a residential Kundalini yoga lifestyle pilot program for addiction in India.	Previously reported substance abuse interventions incorporating meditation and spiritual approaches are believed to provide their benefit through modulation of both psychological and pyschosocial factors. A 90-day residential group pilot treatment program for substance abuse that incorporated a comprehensive array of yoga, meditation, spiritual and mind-body techniques was conducted in Amritsar, India. Subjects showed improvements on a number of psychological self-report questionnaires including the Behavior and Symptom Identification Scale and the Quality of Recovery Index. Application of comprehensive spiritual lifestyle interventions may prove effective in treating substance abuse, particularly in populations receptive to such approaches.

19618577	A profile of the demographics and training characteristics of professional modern dancers.	Modern dancers are a unique group of artists, performing a diverse repertoire in dance companies of various sizes. In this study, 184 professional modern dancers in the United States (males N=49, females N=135), including members of large and small companies as well as freelance dancers, were surveyed regarding their demographics and training characteristics. The mean age of the dancers was 30.1 +/- 7.3 years, and they had danced professionally for 8.9 +/- 7.2 years. The average Body Mass Index (BMI) was 23.6 +/- 2.4 for males and 20.5 +/- 1.7 for females. Females had started taking dance class earlier (age 6.5 +/- 4.2 years) as compared to males (age 15.6 +/- 6.2 years). Females were more likely to have begun their training in ballet, while males more often began with modern classes (55% and 51% respectively, p < 0.0001). The professional modern dancers surveyed spent 8.3 +/- 6.0 hours in class and 17.2 +/- 12.6 hours in rehearsal each week. Eighty percent took modern technique class and 67% reported that they took ballet technique class. The dancers who specified what modern technique they studied (N=84) reported between two and four different techniques. The dancers also participated in a multitude of additional exercise regimens for a total of 8.2 +/- 6.6 hours per week, with the most common types being Pilates, yoga, and upper body weightlifting. The dancers wore many different types of footwear, depending on the style of dance being performed. For modern dance alone, dancers wore 12 different types of footwear. Reflecting the diversity of the dancers and companies surveyed, females reported performing for 23.3 +/- 14.0 weeks (range: 2-52 weeks) per year; males reported performing 20.4 +/- 13.9 weeks (range: 1-40) per year. Only 18% of the dancers did not have any health insurance, with 54% having some type of insurance provided by their employer. However, 23% of the dancers purchased their own insurance, and 22% had insurance provided by their families. Only 16% of dancers reported that they had Workers' Compensation coverage, despite the fact that they were all professionals, including many employed by major modern dance companies across the United States. It is concluded that understanding the training profile of the professional modern dancer should assist healthcare providers in supplying appropriate medical care for these performers.

19445809	Neck pain.	INTRODUCTION: Non-specific neck pain has a postural or mechanical basis and affects about two thirds of people at some stage, especially in middle age. Acute neck pain resolves within days or weeks, but may become chronic in about 10% of people. Whiplash injuries follow sudden acceleration-deceleration of the neck, such as in road traffic or sporting accidents. Up to 40% of people continue to report symptoms 15 years after the accident, although this varies between countries. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for people with non-specific neck pain without severe neurological deficit? What are the effects of treatments for acute whiplash injury? What are the effects of treatments for chronic whiplash injury? What are the effects of treatments for neck pain with radiculopathy? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2007 (BMJ Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 91 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of the evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: acupuncture, biofeedback, drug treatments (analgesics, antidepressants, epidural steroid injections, muscle relaxants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), early mobilisation, early return to normal activity, exercise, heat or cold, manipulation (alone or plus exercise), mobilisation, multimodal treatment, patient education, percutaneous radiofrequency neurotomy, physical treatments, postural techniques (yoga, pilates, Alexander technique), pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) treatment, soft collars and special pillows, spray and stretch, surgery, traction, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).

18096335	Factor analysis of Greene's Climacteric Scale for Indian women.	OBJECTIVE: Do a factor analysis of the Greene Climacteric Scale for a population of Indian perimenopausal women and establish normative values. METHODS: Five hundred and eighteen women, in the age range 45-55 years, were selected and asked to fill out the Greene Climacteric Scale. RESULTS: The mean age of the women was 48.03+/-3.40 years. A factor analysis of the data using an oblique rotation yielded three distinct factors with loadings more than 0.4. The breakup of the psychological factor into an anxiety and a depression factor which has been hypothesized earlier could only be verified using varimax rotation. The last item, "Loss of sexual interest" is shown to be part of the vasomotor factor. The means of the scores on the three factors are: psychological: 8.28+/-5.87, somatic: 4.64+/-3.73 and vasomotor: 2.39+/-2.10. These are much lower than the values given by Greene, but are in consonance with values published in two earlier studies for different populations.

18093307	Wellness through a comprehensive yogic breathing program - a controlled pilot trial.	BACKGROUND: Increasing rates of psychosocial disturbances give rise to increased risks and vulnerability for a wide variety of stress-related chronic pain and other illnesses. Relaxation exercises aim at reducing stress and thereby help prevent these unwanted outcomes. One of the widely used relaxation practices is yoga and yogic breathing exercises. One specific form of these exercises is Sudarshan Kriya and related practices (SK&P) which are understood to have favourable effects on the mind-body system. The goal of this pilot study was to design a protocol that can investigate whether SK&P can lead to increased feeling of wellness in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Participants were recruited in a small university city in Sweden and were instructed in a 6-day intensive program of SK&P which they practiced daily for six weeks. The control group was instructed to relax in an armchair each day during the same period. Subjects included a total of 103 adults, 55 in the intervention (SK&P) group and 48 in the control group. Various instruments were administered before and after the intervention. Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale measured the degree of anxiety and depression, Life Orientation Test measured dispositional optimism, Stress and Energy Test measured individual's energy and stress experiences. Experienced Deviation from Normal State measured the experience of altered state of consciousness. RESULTS: There were no safety issues. Compliance was high (only 1 dropout in the SK&P group, and 5 in the control group). Outcome measures appeared to be appropriate for assessing the differences between the groups. Subjective reports generally correlated with the findings from the instruments. The data suggest that participants in the SK&P group, but not the control group, lowered their degree of anxiety, depression and stress, and also increased their degree of optimism (ANOVA; p < 0.001). The participants in the yoga group experienced the practices as a positive event that induced beneficial effects. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that the experimental protocol that is developed here is safe, compliance level is good, and a full scale trial is feasible. The data obtained suggest that adult participants may improve their wellness by learning and applying a program based on yoga and yogic breathing exercises; this can be conclusively assessed in a large-scale trial.

18079166	Axonal alpha-synuclein aggregates herald centripetal degeneration of cardiac sympathetic nerve in Parkinson's disease.	Degeneration of the cardiac sympathetic nerve occurs in both Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies and begins early in the disease progression of PD, accounting for reduced cardiac uptake of meta-iodobenzylguanidine even in the early stages of Lewy body disease (LBD). We previously demonstrated that degeneration of the distal axons of the cardiac sympathetic nerve precedes loss of their mother neurons in the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia, suggesting distal dominant degeneration of the cardiac sympathetic nerve in PD. Because alpha-synuclein is one of the key molecules in the pathogenesis of this disease, we further investigated how alpha-synuclein aggregates are involved in this distal-dominant degeneration. Both cardiac tissues and paravertebral sympathetic ganglia were obtained for comparison from 20 patients with incidental Lewy body disease (ILBD), 10 with PD, 20 with multiple system atrophy (MSA) and 10 control subjects. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) as a marker for sympathetic nerves, phosphorylated neurofilament as a marker for axons and phosphorylated alpha-synuclein for pathological deposits. We found that (i) alpha-synuclein aggregates in the epicardial nerve fascicles, namely the distal axons of the cardiac sympathetic nerve, were much more abundant in ILBD with preserved TH-ir axons than in this disease with decreased TH-ir axons and PD; (ii) alpha-synuclein aggregates in the epicardial nerve fascicles were closely related to the disappearance of TH-ir axons; (iii) in ILBD with preserved TH-ir axons, alpha-synuclein aggregates were consistently more abundant in the epicardial nerve fascicles than in the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia; (iv) this distal-dominant accumulation of alpha-synuclein aggregates was reversed in ILBD with decreased TH-ir axons and PD, which both showed fewer of these axons but more abundant alpha-synuclein aggregates in the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia and (v) MSA was completely different from ILBD and PD based on the preservation of TH-ir axons and the scarcity of alpha-synuclein aggregates in either the cardiac tissues or the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia. These findings indicate that accumulation of alpha-synuclein aggregates in the distal axons of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system precedes that of neuronal somata or neurites in the paravertebral sympathetic ganglia and that heralds centripetal degeneration of the cardiac sympathetic nerve in PD, which sharply contrasts with slight changes in MSA. This chronological and dynamic relationship between alpha-synuclein aggregates and distal-dominant degeneration of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system may represent the pathological mechanism underlying a common degenerative process in PD.

18070163	Omalizumab is more effective than suplatast tosilate in the treatment of Japanese cedar pollen-induced seasonal allergic rhinitis.	BACKGROUND: Seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) induced by Japanese cedar pollens is a major problem in Japan. Omalizumab, a humanized monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, improves symptoms associated with SAR, but a comparative study with an anti-allergy drug has not yet been conducted. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of omalizumab with suplatast tosilate, a selective T-helper type 2 (Th2) cytokine inhibitor, in patients with Japanese cedar pollen-induced SAR. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy study was conducted in 308 Japanese patients with a history of moderate-to-severe SAR who showed a CAP-RAST value (> or =2+) specifically to Japanese cedar pollens. Patients were treated for 12 weeks with omalizumab plus placebo of suplatast tosilate or suplatast tosilate plus placebo of omalizumab. RESULTS: The mean daily nasal symptom medication scores (sum of the daily nasal symptom severity score and daily nasal rescue medication score) were significantly lower in the omalizumab group than in the suplatast tosilate group during three evaluation periods (P<0.001). The omalizumab group also had significantly lower mean daily nasal severity scores, each of the mean daily nasal and ocular symptom severity scores (sneezing, runny nose, stuffy nose, itchy nose, itchy eyes, watery eyes, and red eyes). Omalizumab reduced rescue medication requirements, and the proportion of days with any rescue medication use in the omalizumab group was significantly lower. Serum-free IgE levels markedly decreased in the omalizumab group and it was associated with clinical efficacy. The adverse reaction profiles were similar between the two groups. The overall incidence of injection site reactions was higher in the omalizumab group than in the suplatast tosilate group, but all these events were of mild degree. No anti-omalizumab antibodies were detected. CONCLUSION: Omalizumab showed significantly greater improvements than suplatast tosilate in the treatment of SAR induced by Japanese cedar pollens.

18065059	Immediate effect of two yoga-based relaxation techniques on performance in a letter-cancellation task.	The performance in a six-letter cancellation task was assessed with 69 male volunteers, ages 18 to 48 years, immediately before and after two yoga-based relaxation techniques and a control session of equal duration. The techniques were Cyclic Meditation and Supine Rest. Cyclic Meditation consists of alternating cycles of yoga postures and supine rest. After both practices, the net scores were significantly higher, although the magnitude of change was more after Cyclic Meditation than after Supine Rest (24.9% versus 13.6%). There was reduction in scores for wrong cancellations after Cyclic Meditation and not after Supine Rest. The control group showed no change. The results suggest that Cyclic Meditation brings about a greater improvement in performance in this task, which requires selective attention, concentration, visual scanning abilities, and a repetitive motor response.

18061787	Complementary and alternative medical therapies for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism.	Complementary and alternative medical (CAM) therapies are commonly used by parents for their children who have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or autism spectrum disorders. The use of these therapies is well documented, yet the evidence of the safety and efficacy of these treatments in children is limited. This article describes the current evidence-based CAM therapies for ADHD and autism, focusing on nutritional interventions; natural health products, including essential fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and other health supplements; biofeedback; and reducing environmental toxins. The CAM evidence in ADHD is addressed, as is the CAM literature in autism.	Weber, Wendy;Newmark, Sanford	2007 Dec

This article defines pediatric obesity and explores those similarities in more detail. It also updates the practitioner on selected integrative approaches as they relate to prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity.	McClafferty, Hilary H	2007 Dec
18053143	Does practicing hatha yoga satisfy recommendations for intensity of physical activity which improves and maintains health and cardiovascular fitness?	BACKGROUND: Little is known about the metabolic and heart rate responses to a typical hatha yoga session. The purposes of this study were 1) to determine whether a typical yoga practice using various postures meets the current recommendations for levels of physical activity required to improve and maintain health and cardiovascular fitness; 2) to determine the reliability of metabolic costs of yoga across sessions; 3) to compare the metabolic costs of yoga practice to those of treadmill walking. METHODS: In this observational study, 20 intermediate-to-advanced level yoga practitioners, age 31.4 +/- 8.3 years, performed an exercise routine inside a human respiratory chamber (indirect calorimeter) while wearing heart rate monitors. The exercise routine consisted of 30 minutes of sitting, 56 minutes of beginner-level hatha yoga administered by video, and 10 minutes of treadmill walking at 3.2 and 4.8 kph each. Measures were mean oxygen consumption (VO2), heart rate (HR), percentage predicted maximal heart rate (%MHR), metabolic equivalents (METs), and energy expenditure (kcal). Seven subjects repeated the protocol so that measurement reliability could be established. RESULTS: Mean values across the entire yoga session for VO2, HR, %MHR, METs, and energy/min were 0.6 L/kg/min; 93.2 beats/min; 49.4%; 2.5; and 3.2 kcal/min; respectively. Results of the ICCs (2,1) for mean values across the entire yoga session for kcal, METs, and %MHR were 0.979 and 0.973, and 0.865, respectively. CONCLUSION: Metabolic costs of yoga averaged across the entire session represent low levels of physical activity, are similar to walking on a treadmill at 3.2 kph, and do not meet recommendations for levels of physical activity for improving or maintaining health or cardiovascular fitness. Yoga practice incorporating sun salutation postures exceeding the minimum bout of 10 minutes may contribute some portion of sufficiently intense physical activity to improve cardio-respiratory fitness in unfit or sedentary individuals. The measurement of energy expenditure across yoga sessions is highly reliable.	Hagins, Marshall;Moore, Wendy;Rundle, Andrew	2007 Nov 30

18035236	Complementary and alternative medicine for sleep disturbances in older adults.	Complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) are frequently used for the treatment of sleep disorders, but in many cases patients do not discuss these therapies directly with their health care provider. There is a growing body of well-designed clinical trials using CAM that have shown the following: (1) Melatonin is an effective agent for the treatment of circadian phase disorders that affect sleep; however, the role of melatonin in the treatment of primary or secondary insomnia is less well established. (2) Valerian has shown a benefit in some, but not all clinical trials. (3) Several other modalities, such as Tai Chi, acupuncture, acupressure, yoga, and meditation have improved sleep parameters in a limited number of early trials. Future work examining CAM has the potential to significantly add to our treatment options for sleep disorders in older adults.	Gooneratne, Nalaka S	2008 Feb
18024224	Systematic review of back schools, brief education, and fear-avoidance training for chronic low back pain.	BACKGROUND: Seven previous systematic reviews (SRs) have evaluated back schools, and one has evaluated brief education, with the latest SR including studies until November 2004. The effectiveness of fear-avoidance training has not been assessed. PURPOSE: To assess the effectiveness of back schools, brief education, and fear-avoidance training for chronic low back pain (CLBP). STUDY DESIGN: A SR. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE database of randomized controlled trials (RCT) until August 2006 for relevant trials reported in English. Assessment of effectiveness was based on pain, disability, and sick leave. RCTs that reported back schools, or brief education as the main intervention, were included. For fear-avoidance training, evaluation of domain-specific outcome was required. Two reviewers independently reviewed the studies. RESULTS: Eight RCTs including 1,002 patients evaluated back schools, three studies were of high quality. We found conflicting evidence for back schools compared with waiting list, placebo, usual care, and exercises, and a cognitive behavioral back school. Twelve trials including 3,583 patients evaluated brief education. Seven trials, six of high quality, evaluated brief education in the clinical setting. We found strong evidence of effectiveness on sick leave and short-term disability compared with usual care. We found conflicting or limited evidence for back book or Internet discussion (five trials, two of high quality) compared with waiting list, no intervention, massage, yoga, or exercises. Three RCTs of high quality, including 364 patients, evaluated fear-avoidance training. We found moderate evidence that there is no difference between rehabilitation including fear-avoidance training and spinal fusion. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent recommendations are given for brief education in the clinical setting, and fear-avoidance training should be considered as an alternative to spinal fusion, and back schools may be considered in the occupational setting. The discordance between reviews can be attributed differences in inclusion criteria and application of evidence rules.	Brox, J I;Storheim, K;Grotle, M;Tveito, T H;Indahl, A;Eriksen, H R	2008 Nov-Dec
18024208	Modulation of cardiac autonomic balance with adjuvant yoga therapy in patients with refractory epilepsy.	The practice of yoga regulates body physiology through control of posture, breathing, and meditation. Effects of yoga on autonomic functions of patients with refractory epilepsy, as quantified by standardized autonomic function tests (AFTs), were determined. The yoga group (n=18) received supervised training in yoga, and the exercise group (n=16) practiced simple routine exercises. AFTs were repeated after 10 weeks of daily sessions. Data were compared with those of healthy volunteers (n=142). The yoga group showed significant improvement in parasympathetic parameters and a decrease in seizure frequency scores. There was no improvement in blood pressure parameters in either group. Two patients in the yoga group achieved normal autonomic functions at the end of 10 weeks of therapy, whereas there were no changes in the exercise group. The data suggest that yoga may have a role as an adjuvant therapy in the management of autonomic dysfunction in patients with refractory epilepsy.

18019884	Exercise and self-esteem in menopausal women: a randomized controlled trial involving walking and yoga.	PURPOSE: To examine the effects of walking and yoga on multidimensional self-esteem and roles played by self-efficacy, body composition, and physical activity (PA) in changes in esteem. DESIGN: Four-month randomized controlled exercise trial with three arms: walking, yoga, and control. SUBJECTS: Previously low-active middle-aged women (n=164; M age = 49.9; SD = 3.6). INTERVENTION: Structured and supervised walking program meeting three times per week for I hour and supervised yoga program meeting twice per week for 90 minutes. MEASURES: Body composition, fitness assessment, and battery of psychologic measures. ANALYSIS: Panel analysis within a structural equation modeling framework using Mplus 3.0. RESULTS: The walking and yoga interventions failed to enhance global or physical self-esteem but improved subdomain esteem relative to physical condition and strength (for walking) and body attractiveness (for both walking and yoga). Over time the effects of PA, self-efficacy, and body fat on changes in physical self-esteem and global esteem were mediated by changes in physical condition and body attractiveness subdomain esteem. Women reporting greater levels of self-efficacy and PA with lower body fat also reported greater enhancements in subdomain esteem. CONCLUSION: These results provide support for the hierarchic and multidimensional nature of self-esteem and indicate that middle-aged women may enhance certain aspects of physical self-esteem by participating in PA.

17996075	Adherence to yoga and exercise interventions in a 6-month clinical trial.	BACKGROUND: To determine factors that predict adherence to a mind-body intervention in a randomized trial. DESIGN: We analyzed adherence data from a 3-arm trial involving 135 generally healthy seniors 65-85 years of age randomized to a 6-month intervention consisting of: an Iyengar yoga class with home practice, an exercise class with home practice, or a wait-list control group. Outcome measures included cognitive function, mood, fatigue, anxiety, health-related quality of life, and physical measures. Adherence to the intervention was obtained by class attendance and biweekly home practice logs. RESULTS: The drop-out rate was 13%. Among the completers of the two active interventions, average yoga class attendance was 77% and home practice occurred 64% of all days. Average exercise class attendance was 69% and home exercise occurred 54% of all days. There were no clear effects of adherence on the significant study outcomes (quality of life and physical measures). Class attendance was significantly correlated with baseline measures of depression, fatigue, and physical components of health-related quality of life. Significant differences in baseline measures were also found between study completers and drop-outs in the active interventions. Adherence was not related to age, gender, or education level. CONCLUSION: Healthy seniors have good attendance at classes with a physically active intervention. Home practice takes place over half of the time. Decreased adherence to a potentially beneficial intervention has the potential to decrease the effect of the intervention in a clinical trial because subjects who might sustain the greatest benefit will receive a lower dose of the intervention and subjects with higher adherence rates may be functioning closer to maximum ability before the intervention. Strategies to maximize adherence among subjects at greater risk for low adherence will be important for future trials, especially complementary treatments requiring greater effort than simple pill-taking.

17965769	Treatment Preferences for CAM in children with chronic pain.	CAM therapies have become increasingly popular in pediatric populations. Yet, little is known about children's preferences for CAM. This study examined treatment preferences in chronic pediatric pain patients offered a choice of CAM therapies for their pain. Participants were 129 children (94 girls) (mean age = 14.5 years +/- 2.4; range = 8-18 years) presenting at a multidisciplinary, tertiary clinic specializing in pediatric chronic pain. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to examine the relationships between CAM treatment preferences and patient's sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, as well as their self-reported level of functioning. Over 60% of patients elected to try at least one CAM approach for pain. The most popular CAM therapies were biofeedback, yoga and hypnosis; the least popular were art therapy and energy healing, with craniosacral, acupuncture and massage being intermediate. Patients with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia (80%) were the most likely to try CAM versus those with other pain diagnoses. In multivariate analyses, pain duration emerged as a significant predictor of CAM preferences. For mind-based approaches (i.e. hypnosis, biofeedback and art therapy), pain duration and limitations in family activities were both significant predictors. When given a choice of CAM therapies, this sample of children with chronic pain, irrespective of pain diagnosis, preferred non-invasive approaches that enhanced relaxation and increased somatic control. Longer duration of pain and greater impairment in functioning, particularly during family activities increased the likelihood that such patients agreed to engage in CAM treatments, especially those that were categorized as mind-based modalities.

17957808	Primary prevention of eating disorders: a constructivist integration of mind and body strategies.	OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the impact of a primary prevention program for eating disorders aimed at fifth-grade females. The curriculum was based on empirically validated risk and protective factors and incorporated interactive discourse, yoga, and relaxation into 10 weekly sessions. METHOD: Pre- and post-test data from five groups conducted over 2 years were combined for a total of 75 participants. Data were also collected from 69 control group participants. RESULTS: Results indicate completion of the group resulted in a significant decrease on scales from the Eating Disorder Inventory-2 measuring body dissatisfaction and bulimia, as well as an increase on the Social scale of the Multidimensional Self-Concept Scale. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate mixed support for the Girls' Group prevention program. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.	Scime, Melinda;Cook-Cottone, Catherine	2008 Mar
17957554	The effectiveness of Tai Chi, yoga, meditation, and Reiki healing sessions in promoting health and enhancing problem solving abilities of registered nurses.	Given the current necessity of retaining qualified nurses, a self-care program consisting of Yoga, Tai Chi, Meditation classes, and Reiki healing sessions was designed for a university-based hospital. The effectiveness of these interventions was evaluated using self-care journals and analyzed using a Heideggerian phenomenological approach. Outcomes of the self-care classes described by nurses included: (a) noticing sensations of warmth, tingling, and pulsation which were relaxing, (b) becoming aware of an enhanced problem solving ability, and (c) noticing an increased ability to focus on patient needs. Hospitals willing to invest in self-care options for nurses can anticipate patient and work related benefits.	Raingruber, Bonnie;Robinson, Carol	2007 Oct
17955765	Effects of hatha yoga on well-being in healthy adults in Shiraz, Islamic Republic of Iran.	There have been many studies on yoga and its effects on physical function, but less attention has been paid to self assessment of improvement in physical and mental health and well-being by yoga practitioners. This study was designed with that purpose using the SF-36 questionnaire in 107 volunteers [44 males and 63 females, mean age 34 (standard deviation 7) years] who attended yoga classes for 6 months. They completed the questionnaire before and after the yoga practice. There was significant improvement in scores for all health items. The differences according to age, sex and education level were not significant. It is concluded that yoga can improve physical and mental health, and promotes well-being.

17946300	A prototype sourceless kinematic-feedback based video game for movement based exercise.	This paper presents a prototype kinematic and audio feedback based video game, availing of a scalable motion capture acquisition system, based around a number of orientation sensors. The orientation sensors used are USB based tri-axis magnetic and gravitational field transducers. The novel video-game is capable of incorporating the real time data from these sensors to control an on screen avatar, which in turn can be programmed to give appropriate instructions to the user i.e. play a sound file, once the user obtains a certain posture. The video game is designed to promote physical exercise and movement based relaxation, in particular; yoga. In addition, design considerations; implementation and performance of the system are analyzed, discussed and the accuracy qualitatively analyzed by comparing movement data obtained from it to that of a validated motion analysis technique, the CODA motion analysis system.

17944760	Effects of an integrated yoga programme on chemotherapy-induced nausea and emesis in breast cancer patients.	This study examined the effect of an integrated yoga programme on chemotherapy-related nausea and emesis in early operable breast cancer outpatients. Sixty-two subjects were randomly allocated to receive yoga (n = 28) or supportive therapy intervention (n = 34) during the course of their chemotherapy. Both groups had similar socio-demographic and medical characteristics. Intervention consisted of both supervised and home practice of yoga sessions lasting for 60 min daily, while the control group received supportive therapy and coping preparation during their hospital visits over a complete course of chemotherapy. The primary outcome measure was the Morrow Assessment of Nausea and Emesis (MANE) assessed after the fourth cycle of chemotherapy. Secondary outcomes included measures for anxiety, depression, quality of life, distressful symptoms and treatment-related toxicity assessed before and during the course of chemotherapy. Following yoga, there was a significant decrease in post-chemotherapy-induced nausea frequency (P = 0.01) and nausea intensity (P = 0.01), and intensity of anticipatory nausea (P = 0.01) and anticipatory vomiting (P = 0.05) as compared with the control group. There was a significant positive correlation between MANE scores and anxiety, depression and distressful symptoms. In conclusion, the results suggest a possible use for stress reduction interventions such as yoga in complementing conventional antiemetics to manage chemotherapy-related nausea and emesis.

17943831	Exercise for improving balance in older people.	BACKGROUND: Diminished ability to maintain balance may be associated with an increased risk of falling. In older adults, falls commonly lead to injury, loss of independence, associated illness and early death. Although some exercise interventions with balance and muscle strengthening components have been shown to reduce falls it is not known which elements, or combination of elements, of exercise interventions are most effective for improving balance in older people. OBJECTIVES: To present the best evidence for effectiveness of exercise interventions designed to improve balance in older people living in the community or in institutional care. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (Feb 2006), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2006), EMBASE (1980 to February 2006), other databases and reference lists of articles. No language restrictions were applied. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials testing exercise interventions designed to improve balance in older people were included. We excluded trials of interventions targeting individuals with specific conditions in order not to broaden the scope of this review too widely. Trials were included where participants were randomised to receive the following: a single exercise intervention or a multiple exercise intervention and a control group (usual activities or attention or recreational activity). Trials comparing two or more exercise interventions and a control group were also included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three pairs of members of the review team independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. For each trial, relative risk and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous outcomes, and mean differences and 95% confidence intervals calculated for continuous outcomes. Where appropriate, results of comparable groups of trials were pooled and 95% confidence intervals calculated. MAIN RESULTS: For the 34 included studies there were 2883 participants at entry. Statistically significant improvements in balance ability were observed for exercise interventions compared to usual activity. Interventions involving gait; balance; co-ordination and functional exercises; muscle strengthening; and multiple exercise types appear to have the greatest impact on indirect measures of balance. There was trend towards an improvement in balance with cycling on a static cycle. However, there was limited evidence that effects were long-lasting. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Exercise appears to have statistically significant beneficial effects on balance ability in the short term but the strength of evidence contained within these trials is limited. Many of these mainly small studies demonstrated a range of methodological weaknesses. The failure across the included studies to apply a core set of standardised outcome measures to determine balance ability restricts the capacity to compare or pool different trials from which firm conclusions regarding efficacy can be made. Further standardisation in timing of outcome assessment is also required as is longer term follow-up of outcomes to determine any lasting effects.

17921873	Concentrative meditation enhances preattentive processing: a mismatch negativity study.	The mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm that is an indicator of preattentive processing was used to study the effects of concentrative meditation. Sudarshan Kriya Yoga meditation is a yogic exercise practiced in an ordered sequence beginning with breathing exercises, and ending with concentrative (Sahaj Samadhi) meditation. Auditory MMN waveforms were recorded at the beginning and after each of these practices for meditators, and equivalently after relaxation sessions for the nonmeditators. Overall meditators were found to have larger MMN amplitudes than nonmeditators. The meditators also exhibited significantly increased MMN amplitudes immediately after meditation suggesting transient state changes owing to meditation. The results indicate that concentrative meditation practice enhances preattentive perceptual processes, enabling better change detection in auditory sensory memory.

17909678	A review of Orang Asli newborns admitted to a neonatal unit in a Malaysian general hospital.	INTRODUCTION: The Orang Asli are the indigenous population in peninsular Malaysia and are in fact a diverse sub-ethnic group with different languages. Our aim was to collect data on Orang Asli newborns, from western and central Pahang, that were admitted to a general hospital with paediatric specialist services. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of all Orang Asli neonates admitted to the Neonatal Unit in Temerloh Hospital over a one-year period (2003). RESULTS: There were 65 Orang Asli admissions out of a total of 1,543 admissions to our Neonatal Unit. The average birth weight was 2,569 g. The commonest indication for admission was neonatal jaundice secondary to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Ten babies were ventilated, seven for prematurity and three for mild-moderate perinatal asphyxia. There were three deaths: a baby with a lethal congenital abnormality, one with congenital rubella syndrome with cardiac failure, and a preterm baby delivered at 28 weeks gestation, with late neonatal sepsis. CONCLUSION: This is the first attempt to assess the health status of Orang Asli neonates in peninsular Malaysia. There are no published reports on the health status of this group of neonates. A larger multicentre study is needed to determine the exact health status of Malaysian Orang Asli newborns.	Kandasamy, Y;Somasundram, P	2007 Oct
17909210	Nonpharmacologic therapies for acute and chronic low back pain: a review of the evidence for an American Pain Society/American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline.	BACKGROUND: Many nonpharmacologic therapies are available for treatment of low back pain. PURPOSE: To assess benefits and harms of acupuncture, back schools, psychological therapies, exercise therapy, functional restoration, interdisciplinary therapy, massage, physical therapies (interferential therapy, low-level laser therapy, lumbar supports, shortwave diathermy, superficial heat, traction, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, and ultrasonography), spinal manipulation, and yoga for acute or chronic low back pain (with or without leg pain). DATA SOURCES: English-language studies were identified through searches of MEDLINE (through November 2006) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006, Issue 4). These electronic searches were supplemented by hand searching of reference lists and additional citations suggested by experts. STUDY SELECTION: Systematic reviews and randomized trials of 1 or more of the preceding therapies for acute or chronic low back pain (with or without leg pain) that reported pain outcomes, back-specific function, general health status, work disability, or patient satisfaction. DATA EXTRACTION: We abstracted information about study design, population characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and adverse events. To grade methodological quality, we used the Oxman criteria for systematic reviews and the Cochrane Back Review Group criteria for individual trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: We found good evidence that cognitive-behavioral therapy, exercise, spinal manipulation, and interdisciplinary rehabilitation are all moderately effective for chronic or subacute (>4 weeks' duration) low back pain. Benefits over placebo, sham therapy, or no treatment averaged 10 to 20 points on a 100-point visual analogue pain scale, 2 to 4 points on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, or a standardized mean difference of 0.5 to 0.8. We found fair evidence that acupuncture, massage, yoga (Viniyoga), and functional restoration are also effective for chronic low back pain. For acute low back pain (<4 weeks' duration), the only nonpharmacologic therapies with evidence of efficacy are superficial heat (good evidence for moderate benefits) and spinal manipulation (fair evidence for small to moderate benefits). Although serious harms seemed to be rare, data on harms were poorly reported. No trials addressed optimal sequencing of therapies, and methods for tailoring therapy to individual patients are still in early stages of development. Evidence is insufficient to evaluate the efficacy of therapies for sciatica. LIMITATIONS: Our primary source of data was systematic reviews. We included non-English-language trials only if they were included in English-language systematic reviews. CONCLUSIONS: Therapies with good evidence of moderate efficacy for chronic or subacute low back pain are cognitive-behavioral therapy, exercise, spinal manipulation, and interdisciplinary rehabilitation. For acute low back pain, the only therapy with good evidence of efficacy is superficial heat.	Chou, Roger;Huffman, Laurie Hoyt	2007 Oct 2
17909209	Diagnosis and treatment of low back pain: a joint clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society.	RECOMMENDATION 1: Clinicians should conduct a focused history and physical examination to help place patients with low back pain into 1 of 3 broad categories: nonspecific low back pain, back pain potentially associated with radiculopathy or spinal stenosis, or back pain potentially associated with another specific spinal cause. The history should include assessment of psychosocial risk factors, which predict risk for chronic disabling back pain (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 2: Clinicians should not routinely obtain imaging or other diagnostic tests in patients with nonspecific low back pain (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 3: Clinicians should perform diagnostic imaging and testing for patients with low back pain when severe or progressive neurologic deficits are present or when serious underlying conditions are suspected on the basis of history and physical examination (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 4: Clinicians should evaluate patients with persistent low back pain and signs or symptoms of radiculopathy or spinal stenosis with magnetic resonance imaging (preferred) or computed tomography only if they are potential candidates for surgery or epidural steroid injection (for suspected radiculopathy) (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 5: Clinicians should provide patients with evidence-based information on low back pain with regard to their expected course, advise patients to remain active, and provide information about effective self-care options (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 6: For patients with low back pain, clinicians should consider the use of medications with proven benefits in conjunction with back care information and self-care. Clinicians should assess severity of baseline pain and functional deficits, potential benefits, risks, and relative lack of long-term efficacy and safety data before initiating therapy (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). For most patients, first-line medication options are acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. RECOMMENDATION 7: For patients who do not improve with self-care options, clinicians should consider the addition of nonpharmacologic therapy with proven benefits-for acute low back pain, spinal manipulation; for chronic or subacute low back pain, intensive interdisciplinary rehabilitation, exercise therapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, spinal manipulation, yoga, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or progressive relaxation (weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

17900042	Chronic stress and insulin resistance-related indices of cardiovascular disease risk, part 2: a potential role for mind-body therapies.	Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability in the industrialized world, and its prevalence is rapidly increasing among developing nations. The increasing global prevalence of CVD reflects in part the concurrent rise in insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia, and other atherogenic changes associated with insulin resistance syndrome (IRS). Evidence suggests that chronic stress and related psychosocial factors also play an important role in the development and progression of IRS-related states and ultimately, in the pathogenesis of CVD. Designed to address these interrelated psychological and physiological components of health, yoga and other traditional mind-body therapies may offer particular promise in both the primary and secondary prevention of CVD. In this article, we review the evidence regarding the potential benefits of specific mind-body modalities for CVD risk reduction and discuss possible mechanisms underlying these observed effects.

17899428	How can exercise be incorporated into the routine care of patients on dialysis?	Regular physical activity and exercise can have many beneficial effects for dialysis patients. The provision of an opportunity for patients to exercise at their treatment center has several advantages, but almost any method of increasing activity is likely to be beneficial. In addition to in-center programs such as cycling exercise before or during dialysis, other exercise options include participation in community-based walking programs, water exercise or swimming, yoga, Tai Chi, or low-level strengthening programs. Physical therapy that is individualized to meet patients' needs is also especially appropriate for older persons. The essential condition is that the unit and staff are committed to a treatment culture that makes physical activity a priority. Asking patients what they are doing for regular exercise should be part of routine patient assessment.	Kutner, Nancy G	2007
17899351	Relationships between mindfulness practice and levels of mindfulness, medical and psychological symptoms and well-being in a mindfulness-based stress reduction program.	Relationships were investigated between home practice of mindfulness meditation exercises and levels of mindfulness, medical and psychological symptoms, perceived stress, and psychological well-being in a sample of 174 adults in a clinical Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program. This is an 8- session group program for individuals dealing with stress-related problems, illness, anxiety, and chronic pain. Participants completed measures of mindfulness, perceived stress, symptoms, and well-being at pre- and post-MBSR, and monitored their home practice time throughout the intervention. Results showed increases in mindfulness and well-being, and decreases in stress and symptoms, from pre- to post-MBSR. Time spent engaging in home practice of formal meditation exercises (body scan, yoga, sitting meditation) was significantly related to extent of improvement in most facets of mindfulness and several measures of symptoms and well-being. Increases in mindfulness were found to mediate the relationships between formal mindfulness practice and improvements in psychological functioning, suggesting that the practice of mindfulness meditation leads to increases in mindfulness, which in turn leads to symptom reduction and improved well-being.

17888067	Yoga in premature ejaculation: a comparative trial with fluoxetine.	INTRODUCTION: Yoga is a popular form of complementary and alternative treatment. It is practiced both in developing and developed countries. Use of yoga for various bodily ailments is recommended in ancient ayvurvedic (ayus = life, veda = knowledge) texts and is being increasingly investigated scientifically. Many patients and yoga protagonists claim that it is useful in sexual disorders. We are interested in knowing if it works for patients with premature ejaculation (PE) and in comparing its efficacy with fluoxetine, a known treatment option for PE. AIM: To know if yoga could be tried as a treatment option in PE and to compare it with fluoxetine. METHODS: A total of 68 patients (38 yoga group; 30 fluoxetine group) attending the outpatient department of psychiatry of a tertiary care hospital were enrolled in the present study. Both subjective and objective assessment tools were administered to evaluate the efficacy of the yoga and fluoxetine in PE. Three patients dropped out of the study citing their inability to cope up with the yoga schedule as the reason. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Intravaginal ejaculatory latencies in yoga group and fluoxetine control groups. RESULTS: We found that all 38 patients (25-65.7% = good, 13-34.2% = fair) belonging to yoga and 25 out of 30 of the fluoxetine group (82.3%) had statistically significant improvement in PE. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga appears to be a feasible, safe, effective and acceptable nonpharmacological option for PE. More studies involving larger patients could be carried out to establish its utility in this condition.	Dhikav, Vikas;Karmarkar, Girish;Gupta, Mallika;Anand, Kuljeet Singh	2007 Nov
17879663	Immediate effect of three yoga breathing techniques on performance on a letter-cancellation task.	The effects of three yoga breathing practices were evaluated on performance on a letter-cancellation task which is a left-hemisphere dominant task. The three yoga breathing practices (right, left, and alternate nostril breathing) were selected because unilateral forced nostril breathing stimulates the contralateral hemisphere. There were 20 male volunteers whose ages ranged from 20 to 45 years (M age=28.4 yr., SD=5.7). All subjects were assessed before and after four sessions, i.e., right nostril yoga breathing, left nostril yoga breathing, alternate nostril yoga breathing, and breath awareness as a control. The letter-cancellation task scores were significantly improved, i.e., there were fewer errors following right and alternate nostril yoga breathing (Wilcoxon paired signed-ranks test). The improved performance may be related to the enhancement of contralateral hemisphere function found with selective nostril breathing.

17877296	Athletes, yogis and individuals with sedentary lifestyles; do their lung functions differ?	Buffalo health study concluded that pulmonary function is a long-term predictor for overall survival rates. It is essential to be involved in physical activity or sports which help in achieving better lung function. Cross sectional observation study was conducted to determine if yoga and athletic activity (running) are associated with better lung functions as compared to subjects with sedentary lifestyles and how does athletes and yogis differ in lung function. Spirometric parameters were assessed in randomly selected 60 healthy male, non-smoking; non-obese subjects-athletes, yogis and sedentary workers. The groups differed significantly in FEV1 and PEFR. The highest mean FEV1 and PEFR were observed in yogis. Both yogis and athletes had significantly better FEV1 as compared to sedentary workers. Yogis also had significantly better PEFR as compared to sedentary workers and athletes. Yogis and athletes had similar lung functions except for better PEFR amongst yogis. Involvement in daily physical activity or sport preferably yoga can help in achieving better pulmonary function.	Prakash, Shivesh;Meshram, Sushant;Ramtekkar, Ujjwal	2007 Jan-Mar

17827096	The effect of iyengar yoga and strengthening exercises for people living with osteoarthritis of the knee: a case series.	This case series describes the impact of various forms of exercise on symptoms associated with osteoarthritis of the knee. A group of 15 women and men performed one of the following: traditional stretching and strengthening exercises, Iyengar yoga, or no structured group exercise. Low back and hamstring flexibility and quadriceps strength and function were monitored before and after the program. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) was used to assess subjective change after the six-week intervention period. A global assessment questionnaire was also completed by each participant and each instructor at the exit sessions to measure perceived changes in improvements since the initiation of the intervention. This study found functional changes and improvement in quality of life in traditional exercise and a yoga based approach that should encourage further comprehensive and carefully designed studies of yoga in osteoarthritis.

17785709	Randomized controlled trial of yoga among a multiethnic sample of breast cancer patients: effects on quality of life.	PURPOSE: This study examines the impact of yoga, including physical poses, breathing, and meditation exercises, on quality of life (QOL), fatigue, distressed mood, and spiritual well-being among a multiethnic sample of breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-eight patients (42% African American, 31% Hispanic) recruited from an urban cancer center were randomly assigned (2:1 ratio) to a 12-week yoga intervention (n = 84) or a 12-week waitlist control group (n = 44). Changes in QOL (eg, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy) from before random assignment (T1) to the 3-month follow-up (T3) were examined; predictors of adherence were also assessed. Nearly half of all patients were receiving medical treatment. RESULTS: Regression analyses indicated that the control group had a greater decrease in social well-being compared with the intervention group after controlling for baseline social well-being and covariates (P < .0001). Secondary analyses of 71 patients not receiving chemotherapy during the intervention period indicated favorable outcomes for the intervention group compared with the control group in overall QOL (P < .008), emotional well-being (P < .015), social well-being (P < .004), spiritual well-being (P < .009), and distressed mood (P < .031). Sixty-nine percent of intervention participants attended classes (mean number of classes attended by active class participants = 7.00 +/- 3.80), with lower adherence associated with increased fatigue (P < .001), radiotherapy (P < .0001), younger age (P < .008), and no antiestrogen therapy (P < .02). CONCLUSION: Despite limited adherence, this intent-to-treat analysis suggests that yoga is associated with beneficial effects on social functioning among a medically diverse sample of breast cancer survivors. Among patients not receiving chemotherapy, yoga appears to enhance emotional well-being and mood and may serve to buffer deterioration in both overall and specific domains of QOL.

17764203	Meditation practices for health: state of the research.	OBJECTIVES: To review and synthesize the state of research on a variety of meditation practices, including: the specific meditation practices examined; the research designs employed and the conditions and outcomes examined; the efficacy and effectiveness of different meditation practices for the three most studied conditions; the role of effect modifiers on outcomes; and the effects of meditation on physiological and neuropsychological outcomes. DATA SOURCES: Comprehensive searches were conducted in 17 electronic databases of medical and psychological literature up to September 2005. Other sources of potentially relevant studies included hand searches, reference tracking, contact with experts, and gray literature searches. REVIEW METHODS: A Delphi method was used to develop a set of parameters to describe meditation practices. Included studies were comparative, on any meditation practice, had more than 10 adult participants, provided quantitative data on health-related outcomes, and published in English. Two independent reviewers assessed study relevance, extracted the data and assessed the methodological quality of the studies. RESULTS: Five broad categories of meditation practices were identified (Mantra meditation, Mindfulness meditation, Yoga, Tai Chi, and Qi Gong). Characterization of the universal or supplemental components of meditation practices was precluded by the theoretical and terminological heterogeneity among practices. Evidence on the state of research in meditation practices was provided in 813 predominantly poor-quality studies. The three most studied conditions were hypertension, other cardiovascular diseases, and substance abuse. Sixty-five intervention studies examined the therapeutic effect of meditation practices for these conditions. Meta-analyses based on low-quality studies and small numbers of hypertensive participants showed that TM(R), Qi Gong and Zen Buddhist meditation significantly reduced blood pressure. Yoga helped reduce stress. Yoga was no better than Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction at reducing anxiety in patients with cardiovascular diseases. No results from substance abuse studies could be combined. The role of effect modifiers in meditation practices has been neglected in the scientific literature. The physiological and neuropsychological effects of meditation practices have been evaluated in 312 poor-quality studies. Meta-analyses of results from 55 studies indicated that some meditation practices produced significant changes in healthy participants. CONCLUSIONS: Many uncertainties surround the practice of meditation. Scientific research on meditation practices does not appear to have a common theoretical perspective and is characterized by poor methodological quality. Firm conclusions on the effects of meditation practices in healthcare cannot be drawn based on the available evidence. Future research on meditation practices must be more rigorous in the design and execution of studies and in the analysis and reporting of results.

17761637	Effects of an integrated yoga program in modulating psychological stress and radiation-induced genotoxic stress in breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy.	Effects of an integrated yoga program in modulating perceived stress levels, anxiety, as well as depression levels and radiation-induced DNA damage were studied in 68 breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. Two psychological questionnaires--Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)--and DNA damage assay were used in the study. There was a significant decrease in the HADS scores in the yoga intervention group, whereas the control group displayed an increase in these scores. Mean PSS was decreased in the yoga group, whereas the control group did not show any change pre- and postradiotherapy. Radiation-induced DNA damage was significantly elevated in both the yoga and control groups after radiotherapy, but the postradiotherapy DNA damage in the yoga group was slightly less when compared to the control group. An integrated approach of yoga intervention modulates the stress and DNA damage levels in breast cancer patients during radiotherapy.

17724650	[Diagnosis and therapy of carpal tunnel syndrome--guideline of the German Societies of Handsurgery, Neurosurgery, Neurology, Orthopaedics, Clinical Neurophysiology and Functional Imaging, Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgery, and Surgery for Traumatology].	Evidence-based supradisciplinary guideline that deals with the epidemiology, pathogenesis, symptoms, clinical and electrophysiological diagnosis, supplementary imaging investigations, differential diagnosis, conservative and surgical treatments, prognosis and course along with complications and revision surgery. The recommendations on investigation and treatment are based on a comprehensive literature search with critical evaluation and two consensus methods (expert group and Delphi technique) within the participating specialist societies. Besides this long version, a short version and a patient version can be viewed through the AWMF platform. The development of the guideline and the methodological foundations are documented in a method report. MAIN STATEMENTS: Apart from an accurate history and clinical neurological examination (including clinical tests), electrophysiological investigations (distal motor latency and sensory neurography) are particularly important. Radiography, MRI, high-resolution ultrasonography can be regarded as optional supplementary investigations. Among conservative treatment methods, treatment with a nocturnal splint and local infiltration of a corticosteroid preparation are effective. Oral steroids, splinting and ultrasound showed only short-term benefit. Surgical treatment is clearly superior to all other methods. Open and endoscopic procedures (when the endoscopic surgeon has sufficient experience) are equivalent. A routine epineurotomy and interfascicular neurolysis cannot be recommended. Early functional treatment postoperatively is important.

17724393	Physical and psychological outcomes of a supported physical activity program for older carers.	This study evaluated health benefits of a supported physical activity program for 116 older carers (mean age 64.4 [SD = 7.9], 85% women). Participants undertook a 6-month center-based physical activity program (strength training, yoga, or Tai Chi). Eighty-eight participants (76%) completed the program. Multivariate repeated-measures ANOVA identified overall significant improvement postintervention (p = .004). Univariate analyses revealed significant improvements for balance, strength, gait endurance, depression, and SF-36 (physical component; p < .05). There was no change in the Zarit Carer Burden Scale (p > .05). Change in performance scores did not differ significantly between those with higher and lower attendance at classes, although there was significantly greater improvement in gait endurance and balance (p < .05) in those attending classes run twice weekly than in those attending once-weekly classes. In conclusion, a carer physical activity program, providing additional carer support to facilitate participation, can achieve high levels of involvement by carers and significant health benefits.

17714796	Use of complementary and alternative medicine in pediatric otolaryngology patients attending a tertiary hospital in the UK.	OBJECTIVE: Little data is available on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use in children attending otolaryngology services. We investigated the prevalence and pattern of CAM use among children attending the pediatric otolaryngology department in a tertiary pediatric teaching hospital in Scotland. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey conducted by administering an anonymous questionnaire to the parents accompanying patients attending the pediatric otolaryngology department. Elective admissions and clinic attendees were included over a 3-month period in 2005/2006. SETTING: Academic tertiary care referral centre in North-East Scotland. PATIENTS: Five hundred and fifty-four consecutive patients aged less than 16 years were eligible. The response rate was 59% (n=327). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of CAM use in children. Secondary measures include types of CAM used, indications for use and communication with family physicians. RESULTS: Based on 327 responses, 93 patients (29%) had ever used CAM, 20% within the last year. Commonly used CAM preparations were cod-liver oil, echinacea, aloe vera, cranberry, primrose oil and herbal vitamin supplements. The popular non-herbal CAM included homeopathy, massage, aromatherapy, chiropractic, yoga and reiki. Nineteen percent used CAM for their admission illness. Sixty-one percent of parents thought that CAM was effective and 65% would recommend it to others. Fifty-one percent of parents stated that the family physician was unaware of CAM use by the child. CONCLUSIONS: Despite concerns regarding the efficacy, safety and cost effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine, its use among the pediatric otolaryngology population is more common than many providers may realize. This has implications for all healthcare workers involved in their care.	Shakeel, M;Little, S A;Bruce, J;Ah-See, K W	2007 Nov
17709061	A modified yoga-based exercise program in hemodialysis patients: a randomized controlled study.	AIM: To evaluate the effects of a yoga-based exercise program on pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and biochemical markers in hemodialysis patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2004 a randomized controlled trial was carried out in the outpatient hemodialysis unit of the Nephrology Department, Uludag University Faculty of Medicine. Clinically stable hemodialysis patients (n=37) were included and followed in two groups: the modified yoga-based exercise group (n=19) and the control group (n=18). Yoga-based exercises were done in groups for 30 min/day twice a week for 3 months. All of the patients in the yoga and control groups were given an active range of motion exercises to do for 10 min at home. The main outcome measures were pain intensity (measured by the visual analogue scale, VAS), fatigue (VAS), sleep disturbance (VAS), and grip strength (mmHg); biochemical variables-- urea, creatinine, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, phosphorus, cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglyceride, erythrocyte, hematocrit--were evaluated. RESULTS: After a 12-week intervention, significant improvements were seen in the variables: pain -37%, fatigue -55%, sleep disturbance -25%, grip strength +15%, urea -29%, creatinine -14%, alkaline phosphatase -15%, cholesterol -15%, erythrocyte +11%, and hematocrit count +13%; no side-effects were seen. Improvement of the variables in the yoga-based exercise program was found to be superior to that in the control group for all the variables except calcium, phosphorus, HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels. CONCLUSION: A simplified yoga-based rehabilitation program is a complementary, safe and effective clinical treatment modality in patients with end-stage renal disease.

17698453	Yoga in stroke rehabilitation: a systematic review and results of a pilot study.	PURPOSE: This article presents a systematic review of the literature pertaining to the use of yoga in stroke rehabilitation. In addition, we present the results of a small pilot study designed to explore the hypothesis that a Kundalini yoga practice of 12 weeks would lead to an improvement in aphasia as well as in fine motor coordination in stroke patients. METHOD: The 3 participants attended yoga classes twice a week for 12 weeks, before and after which they were tested on the O'Connor Tweezer Dexterity test, a timed test where the participant places pins in a Peg-Board with tweezers, and the Boston Aphasia Exam for speech. RESULTS: All 3 participants showed improvement on both measures. CONCLUSION: The small sample size makes it impossible to draw definite conclusions, but the positive trends in this study suggest that further research should be done to examine the effects of Kundalini yoga on specific illnesses or medical conditions.

17695740	A case report of patient practising yoga leading to dental erosion.	The article presents the case of a patient who was practising Yoga (Kunjal kriya) which led to dental erosion. Dental erosion can be due to extrinsic or intrinsic causes. The intrinsic causes include vomiting due to anorexia nervosa, regurgitation due to abnormality in gastro-intestinal tract or rumination. A 38-year-old male patient presented with a rare aetiology of dental erosion. He had practiced kunjal kriya one of the yogic exercises described in ancient India. In kunjal kriya the patient vomits on an empty stomach in order to clean his or her gastro-intestinal tract. The patient had practiced this form of exercise for over 12 years which had led to severe dental erosion. A proper case history should be evaluated for every patient so that they can be counselled for any factors that could be detrimental to dental health. Early diagnosis is paramount in recognising the aetiology of dental erosion so that detrimental effects on the dentition can be prevented.

17667891	Selective unilateral autonomic activation: implications for psychiatry.	Research advances have led to three methods for selectively activating one half of the autonomic nervous system in humans. The first method is an ancient yogic technique called unilateral forced nostril breathing (UFNB) that employs forced breathing through only one nostril while closing off the other. The second method works by stimulation of an autonomic reflex point on the fifth intercostal space near the axilla. The most recent method employs unilateral vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) via the mid-inferior cervical branch and requires surgical implantation of a wire and pacemaker. UFNB is non-invasive and seems to selectively activate the ipsilateral branch of the sympathetic nervous system with a possible compensation effect leading to contralateral VNS. UFNB and VNS have been employed to treat psychiatric disorders. While UFNB has been studied for its potential effects on the endogenous ultradian rhythms of the autonomic and central nervous system, and their tightly coupled correlates, VNS has yet to be studied in this regard. This article reviews these three methods and discusses their similarities, putative mechanisms, their studied effects on the endogenous autonomic nervous system and central nervous system rhythms, and their implications for the treatment of psychiatric disorders.

17655565	Yoga therapy as an add-on treatment in the management of patients with schizophrenia--a randomized controlled trial.	OBJECTIVE: Treatment of schizophrenia has remained unsatisfactory despite the availability of antipsychotics. This study examined the efficacy of yoga therapy (YT) as an add-on treatment to the ongoing antipsychotic treatment. METHOD: Sixty-one moderately ill schizophrenia patients were randomly assigned to YT (n = 31) and physical exercise therapy (PT; n = 30) for 4 months. They were assessed at baseline and 4 months after the start of intervention, by a rater who was blind to their group status. RESULTS: Forty-one subjects (YT = 21; PT = 20) were available at the end of 4 months for assessment. Subjects in the YT group had significantly less psychopathology than those in the PT group at the end of 4 months. They also had significantly greater social and occupational functioning and quality of life. CONCLUSION: Both non-pharmacological interventions contribute to reduction in symptoms, with YT having better efficacy.	Duraiswamy, G;Thirthalli, J;Nagendra, H R;Gangadhar, B N	2007 Sep
17654495	Tissue stretch decreases soluble TGF-beta1 and type-1 procollagen in mouse subcutaneous connective tissue: evidence from ex vivo and in vivo models.	Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta1) plays a key role in connective tissue remodeling, scarring, and fibrosis. The effects of mechanical forces on TGF-beta1 and collagen deposition are not well understood. We tested the hypothesis that brief (10 min) static tissue stretch attenuates TGF-beta1-mediated new collagen deposition in response to injury. We used two different models: (1) an ex vivo model in which excised mouse subcutaneous tissue (N = 44 animals) was kept in organ culture for 4 days and either stretched (20% strain for 10 min 1 day after excision) or not stretched; culture media was assayed by ELISA for TGF-beta1; (2) an in vivo model in which mice (N = 22 animals) underwent unilateral subcutaneous microsurgical injury on the back, then were randomized to stretch (20-30% strain for 10 min twice a day for 7 days) or no stretch; subcutaneous tissues of the back were immunohistochemically stained for Type-1 procollagen. In the ex vivo model, TGF-beta1 protein was lower in stretched versus non-stretched tissue (repeated measures ANOVA, P < 0.01). In the in vivo model, microinjury resulted in a significant increase in Type-1 procollagen in the absence of stretch (P < 0.001), but not in the presence of stretch (P = 0.21). Thus, brief tissue stretch attenuated the increase in both soluble TGF-beta1 (ex vivo) and Type-1 procollagen (in vivo) following tissue injury. These results have potential relevance to the mechanisms of treatments applying brief mechanical stretch to tissues (e.g., physical therapy, respiratory therapy, mechanical ventilation, massage, yoga, acupuncture).

17635893	Acute emotional stress and cardiac arrhythmias.	Episodes of acute emotional stress can have significant adverse effects on the heart. Acute emotional stress can produce left ventricular contractile dysfunction, myocardial ischemia, or disturbances of cardiac rhythm. Although these abnormalities are often only transient, their consequences can be gravely damaging and sometimes fatal. Despite the many descriptions of catastrophic cardiovascular events in the setting of acute emotional stress, the anatomical substrate and physiological pathways by which emotional stress triggers cardiovascular events are only now being characterized, aided by the advent of functional neuroimaging. Recent evidence indicates that asymmetric brain activity is particularly important in making the heart more susceptible to ventricular arrhythmias. Lateralization of cerebral activity during emotional stress may stimulate the heart asymmetrically and produce areas of inhomogeneous repolarization that create electrical instability and facilitate the development of cardiac arrhythmias. Patients with ischemic heart disease who survive an episode of sudden cardiac death in the setting of acute emotional stress should receive a beta-blocker. Nonpharmacological approaches to manage emotional stress in patients with and without coronary artery disease, including social support, relaxation therapy, yoga, meditation, controlled slow breathing, and biofeedback, are also appropriate to consider and merit additional investigation in randomized trials.

17619753	Alternative therapeutic intervention for individuals with Rett syndrome.	The individual with Rett syndrome (RS) displays an array of challenging difficulties in all areas of daily living. Since there is no cure for the disorder at this moment, parents of the individual with Rett search for different interventional modalities that will improve the condition and quality of life for their child. During the last few years, many individuals with RS have experienced different kinds of interventions. This paper presents these methods with relevant case stories for others to share the possibilities. This paper reviews the following interventions: animal-assisted therapy, such as dolphin therapy and dog-assisted therapy; auditory integration training; hyperbaric chamber; manual therapy, such as acupuncture/acupressure, aromatherapy, craniosacral therapy, Mayo facial release, Treager massage, chiropractor, and Reiki; mental modification techniques, such as Lovas and cognitive rehabilitation; motoric interventions, such as advanced biomechanical rehabilitation, patterning/Doman-DeLacato approach, and yoga. The present paper is not a recommendation for any of the above-mentioned techniques, but merely a review of different interventions available for the inquisitive parent of the individual with RS.

17613571	A systematic review of conservative treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of conservative therapy in carpal tunnel syndrome. DATA SOURCES: A computer-aided search of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Collaboration was conducted for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from January 1985 to May 2006. REVIEW METHODS: RCTs were included if: (1) the patients, with clinically and electrophysiologically confirmed carpal tunnel syndrome, had not previously undergone surgical release, (2) the efficacy of one or more conservative treatment options was evaluated, (3) the study was designed as a randomized controlled trial. Two reviewers independently selected the studies and performed data extraction using a standardized form. In order to assess the methodological quality, the criteria list of the Cochrane Back Review Group for systematic reviews was applied. The different treatment methods were grouped (local injections, oral therapies, physical therapies, therapeutic exercises and splints). RESULTS: Thirty-three RCTs were included in the review. The studies were analysed to determine the strength of the available evidence for the efficacy of the treatment. Our review shows that: (1) locally injected steroids produce a significant but temporary improvement, (2) vitamin B6 is ineffective, (3) steroids are better than non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and diuretics, but they can produce side-effects, (4) ultrasound is effective while laser therapy shows variable results, (5) exercise therapy is not effective, (6) splints are effective, especially if used full-time. CONCLUSION: There is: (1) strong evidence (level 1) on efficacy of local and oral steroids; (2) moderate evidence (level 2) that vitamin B6 is ineffective and splints are effective and (3) limited or conflicting evidence (level 3) that NSAIDs, diuretics, yoga, laser and ultrasound are effective whereas exercise therapy and botulinum toxin B injection are ineffective.

17613150	Review of intervention studies on depression in persons with multiple sclerosis.	Depression is prevalent among persons with multiple sclerosis (MS), an acquired neurologic disability that affects predominantly women. The purpose of this article is to review intervention studies on depression in persons with MS. An integrative review of eight intervention studies published from 2000 to 2005 has revealed that various interventions could potentially alleviate depression. Although no definite conclusions can be made from this review, there is reasonable evidence that cognitive behavioral approaches are beneficial in the treatment of depression and in helping people adjust to, and cope with, having MS.

17610459	Mind-body interventions for chronic pain in older adults: a structured review.	STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a structured review of eight mind-body interventions for older adults with chronic nonmalignant pain. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and evidence for pain reduction in older adults with chronic nonmalignant pain in the following mind-body therapies: biofeedback, progressive muscle relaxation, meditation, guided imagery, hypnosis, tai chi, qi gong, and yoga. METHODS: Relevant studies in the MEDLINE, PsycINFO, AMED, and CINAHL databases were located. A manual search of references from retrieved articles was also conducted. Of 381 articles retrieved through search strategies, 20 trials that included older adults with chronic pain were reviewed. RESULTS: Fourteen articles included participants aged 50 years and above, while only two of these focused specifically on persons aged >or=65 years. An additional six articles included persons aged >or=50 years. Fourteen articles were controlled trials. There is some support for the efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation plus guided imagery for osteoarthritis pain. There is limited support for meditation and tai chi for improving function or coping in older adults with low back pain or osteoarthritis. In an uncontrolled biofeedback trial that stratified by age group, both older and younger adults had significant reductions in pain following the intervention. Several studies included older adults, but did not analyze benefits by age. Tai chi, yoga, hypnosis, and progressive muscle relaxation were significantly associated with pain reduction in these studies. CONCLUSION: The eight mind-body interventions reviewed are feasible in an older population. They are likely safe, but many of the therapies included modifications tailored for older adults. There is not yet sufficient evidence to conclude that these eight mind-body interventions reduce chronic nonmalignant pain in older adults. Further research should focus on larger, clinical trials of mind-body interventions to answer this question.	Morone, Natalia E;Greco, Carol M	2007 May-Jun

17577191	Healthcare beliefs of Indian patients living with leg and foot ulcers.	This article presents the results of a previously unexplored aspect of qualitative leg ulcer research. The study has examined the lived experience and cultural illness explanations of a sample of British-Indian patients living with leg and foot ulceration. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data from 16 Indian patients drawn from leg ulcer clinics and district nursing lists in Ealing Primary Care Trust and Hounslow Primary Care Trust. Eight respondents had venous ulceration, seven were diabetic and had ulcers of arterial aetiology, and one had ulceration due to lymphoedema. Popular perceptions of the cause of leg ulceration were influenced by the humoral theories of balance and imbalance. Other explanations included poor circulation, lowered immunity, bad blood, being cursed and doing something wrong in a past life or this life.	Lewis, Christine	2007 Jun 14-27
17573200	NO netting, health and stress - studying wellness from a net perspective.	On the nature of wellness, stress, netting and the radical gas nitric oxide (NO). The multi-complex role of NO resulted in its discoverers receiving a Nobel award, its presence everywhere and volatility makes it a suitable candidate to be a main signal in an instantaneous communication network. Such network, with the capacity of tight physiological monitoring, enables assets distributions in the body. A model is presented suggesting that an inter-cellular communication network coordinates the various bodily functions. Radical gases like nitric oxide (NO) are signals in this net and its usability affects health and indicates wellness. From this netting point of view, stress is the sense of flow interruption or blockage of the information stream. Such flow interruption affects also physiological functions and can explain the association between stress and many ailments. It is suggested that netting is a prerequisite route of wellness, enabling bodily unconscious managerial decisions. This vital diffusive network is extremely labile and potentially could contain the interplay of consciousness and unconsciousness effected by activities such as yoga or guided imagery. Vast data from studies on NO signals, health and the relaxation/stress processes have already been accumulated. Integration of these data supports this novel look of an NO network as a coordinator. Interactions between stress and health are discussed in net perspective and include basic concepts of some integrative health approaches. Studying the nature of such communication network and of NO may suggest new ways to reduce stress and approach wellness.	Ralt, Dina	2008
17571741	Role of yoga in diabetes.	The science of yoga is an ancient one. It is a rich heritage of our culture. Several older books make a mention of the usefulness of yoga in the treatment of certain diseases and preservation of health in normal individuals. The effect of yogic practices on the management of diabetes has not been investigated well. We carried out well designed studies in normal individuals and those with diabetes to assess the role of yogic practices on glycaemic control, insulin kinetics, body composition exercise tolerance and various co-morbidities like hypertension and dyslipidemia. These studies were both short term and long-term. These studies have confirmed the useful role of yoga in the control of diabetes mellitus. Fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels came down significantly. Good glycaemic status can be maintained for long periods of time. There was a lowering of drug requirement and the incidence of acute complications like infection and ketosis was significantly reduced. There were significant changes in the insulin kinetics and those of counter-regulatory hormones like cortisol. There was a decrease in free fatty acids. There was an increase in lean body mass and decrease in body fat percentage. The number of insulin receptors was also increased. There was an improvement in insulin sensitivity and decline in insulin resistance. All these suggest that yogic practices have a role even in the prevention of diabetes. There is a beneficial effect on the co-morbid conditions like hypertension and dyslipidemia.	Sahay, B K	2007 Feb
17544857	A randomised comparative trial of yoga and relaxation to reduce stress and anxiety.	OBJECTIVE: To compare yoga and relaxation as treatment modalities at 10 and 16 weeks from study baseline to determine if either of modality reduces subject stress, anxiety, blood pressure and improve quality of life. DESIGN: A randomised comparative trial was undertaken comparing yoga with relaxation. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and thirty-one subjects with mild to moderate levels of stress were recruited from the community in South Australia. INTERVENTIONS: Ten weekly 1- h sessions of relaxation or hatha yoga. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Changes in the State Trait Personality Inventory sub-scale anxiety, General Health Questionnaire and the Short Form-36. RESULTS: Following the 10 week intervention stress, anxiety and quality of life scores improved over time. Yoga was found to be as effective as relaxation in reducing stress, anxiety and improving health status on seven domains of the SF-36. Yoga was more effective than relaxation in improving mental health. At the end of the 6 week follow-up period there were no differences between groups in levels of stress, anxiety and on five domains of the SF-36. Vitality, social function and mental health scores on the SF-36 were higher in the relaxation group during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Yoga appears to provide a comparable improvement in stress, anxiety and health status compared to relaxation.	Smith, Caroline;Hancock, Heather;Blake-Mortimer, Jane;Eckert, Kerena	2007 Jun
17539459	Integrated management of filarial lymphedema for rural communities.	The Global Alliance for the Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis (GAELF) has recommended exploring local health traditions of skin care and a low cost treatment paradigm for rural communities has been proposed by Vaqas and Ryan. Our case study incorporates these promising treatments for use in treating filariasis in rural communities. Patients having lymphedema of one or both lower limbs (skin: normal, thickened or with trophic/warty changes) received treatment components from ayurveda, yoga and biomedicine simultaneously: including soap wash, phanta soaking, Indian manual lymph drainage (IMLD), pre- and post-IMLD yoga exercises, and compression using bandages for 194 days, along with diet restrictions and oral herbal medicines indicated for "elephantiasis" in Ayurveda. Entry points when infected were treated with biomedical drugs. The study was conducted in the reverse pharmacology design. 112 patients and 149 lower limbs completed 194 days of treatment during 2003-2006. Significant improvements were observed in the limb circumference measurements and the frequency of acute dermatolymphangioadenitis, use of preventive antibiotics, and reduction in the number of entry points were also improved. The objective to obtain significant benefit for a common problem using locally available, sustainable and affordable means has been achieved. It has not been our purpose to show that the regimen employed is better than another but the results do pose the question--"Are there components of Ayurvedic medicine that deserve further study?" It is important to understand that the regimen has been delivered mostly at home and that participants we have treated, representing a population suffering from a common problem, have not had access to effective conservative therapy that is culturally acceptable, safe, and efficacious.

17532740	Searching for CAM evidence: an evaluation of therapy-specific search strategies.	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this investigation was to explore the effectiveness of search strategies developed to identify trials of specific complementary therapies in a range of clinical conditions. DESIGN: All primary studies included in a series of systematic reviews were identified. An analysis of the original source of the study and search term(s) by means of which the study had originally been retrieved was carried out. Each study was then searched for in each of 6 databases (AMED, Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO). The proportion of studies located on each database was assessed and the indexing terms identified for each therapy were compared against the original search strategies. RESULTS: A total of 127 primary studies were identified from 35 systematic reviews. The number of studies on each therapy varied, but Cochrane CENTRAL listed the highest proportion for all therapies. No database listed all studies, and at least one unique study was listed on all databases except MEDLINE, whereas several studies were not found on any of the databases. Index terms were effective in locating studies on acupuncture, individual herbs, hypnosis, massage, and yoga. For the remaining therapies, use of text word search terms was important and particularly so for homeopathy, meditation, and reflexology. Variation in terminology for most of the therapies was encountered. CONCLUSIONS: The small numbers of studies preclude firm recommendations, but several potential challenges in searching for complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) trials are highlighted. The findings suggest that a range of different sources is required for identifying relevant studies, particularly for certain therapies. The development of an optimum generic search strategy for each therapy is hampered by the variation in indexing of CAM studies. Possible optimum strategies are presented as a basis for discussion, and further testing of the effectiveness of these strategies is now a priority.	Pilkington, Karen	2007 May
17532734	Yoga Asana sessions increase brain GABA levels: a pilot study.	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare changes in brain gamma-aminobutyric (GABA) levels associated with an acute yoga session versus a reading session. It was hypothesized that an individual yoga session would be associated with an increase in brain GABA levels. DESIGN: This is a parallel-groups design. SETTINGS/LOCATION: Screenings, scan acquisitions, and interventions took place at medical school-affiliated centers. SUBJECTS: The sample comprised 8 yoga practitioners and 11 comparison subjects. INTERVENTIONS: Yoga practitioners completed a 60-minute yoga session and comparison subjects completed a 60-minute reading session. OUTCOME MEASURES: GABA-to-creatine ratios were measured in a 2-cm axial slab using magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging immediately prior to and immediately after interventions. RESULTS: There was a 27% increase in GABA levels in the yoga practitioner group after the yoga session (0.20 mmol/kg) but no change in the comparison subject group after the reading session ( -0.001 mmol/kg) (t = -2.99, df = 7.87, p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that in experienced yoga practitioners, brain GABA levels increase after a session of yoga. This suggests that the practice of yoga should be explored as a treatment for disorders with low GABA levels such as depression and anxiety disorders. Future studies should compare yoga to other forms of exercise to help determine whether yoga or exercise alone can alter GABA levels.

17521871	One year pre-post intervention follow-up of psychological, immune, endocrine and blood pressure outcomes of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) in breast and prostate cancer outpatients.	OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the ongoing effects of participation in a mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program on quality of life (QL), symptoms of stress, mood and endocrine, immune and autonomic parameters in early stage breast and prostate cancer patients. METHODS: Forty-nine patients with breast cancer and 10 with prostate cancer enrolled in an eight-week MBSR program that incorporated relaxation, meditation, gentle yoga and daily home practice. Demographic and health behaviors, QL, mood, stress symptoms, salivary cortisol levels, immune cell counts, intracellular cytokine production, blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were assessed pre- and post-intervention, and at 6- and 12-month follow-up. RESULTS: Fifty-nine, 51, 47 and 41 patients were assessed pre- and post-intervention and at 6- and 12-month follow-up, respectively, although not all participants provided data on all outcomes at each time point. Linear mixed modeling showed significant improvements in overall symptoms of stress which were maintained over the follow-up period. Cortisol levels decreased systematically over the course of the follow-up. Immune patterns over the year supported a continued reduction in Th1 (pro-inflammatory) cytokines. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased from pre- to post-intervention and HR was positively associated with self-reported symptoms of stress. CONCLUSIONS: MBSR program participation was associated with enhanced quality of life and decreased stress symptoms, altered cortisol and immune patterns consistent with less stress and mood disturbance, and decreased blood pressure. These pilot data represent a preliminary investigation of the longer-term relationships between MBSR program participation and a range of potentially important biomarkers.

17509439	Unloaded movement facilitation exercise compared to no exercise or alternative therapy on outcomes for people with nonspecific chronic low back pain: a systematic review.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of unloaded movement facilitation exercises on outcomes for people with nonspecific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP). METHODS: This systematic review was conducted according to Cochrane Back Review Group and Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses (QUORUM) guidelines. Exercise effects were reported as standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: Six high-quality randomized controlled trials were included. For NSCLBP effects favored McKenzie therapy over intensive trunk strengthening for pain: SMD: short-term: 0.35 (0.10, 0.59); long-term 0.36 (0.12, 0.61) and short-term function: SMD: 0.45 (0.20, 0.70) and were comparable for medium-term function: SMD: 0.15 (-0.90, 0.40). Effects of favored McKenzie therapy were comparable to specific spinal stabilization exercises for short-term pain: SMD: 0.63 (-0.11, 1.38) and function: SMD: 0.47 (-0.27, 1.20). Pooled effects favored McKenzie therapy over other exercises for short-term pain (pooled SMD: 0.38 (0.14, 0.61)) and were comparable for short-term function: SMD: 0.10 (-0.20, 0.40). Yoga compared to trunk strengthening produced comparable effects for pain: (SMD: short-term: 0.13 (-0.46, 0.71); medium-term 0.51 (-0.08, 1.11)) and function SMD: short-term: 0.51 (-0.08, 1.10); medium-term 0.38 (-0.22, 0.97)). Compared to education, effects of yoga were large for medium-term pain and function (pooled SMDs: 0.92 (0.47, 1.37); 0.95 (0.50, 1.40)). Effects favored unloaded movement facilitation exercises of McKenzie compared to other or no exercise and were comparable for yoga. CONCLUSIONS: For NSCLBP, there is strong evidence that unloaded movement facilitation exercise, compared to no exercise, improves pain and function. Compared to other types of exercise, including effort-intensive strengthening and time-intensive stabilization exercise, the effects are comparable. This challenges the role of strengthening for NSCLBP.	Slade, Susan C;Keating, Jennifer L	2007 May
17506893	CAM therapies among primary care patients using opioid therapy for chronic pain.	BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is an increasingly common therapy used to treat chronic pain syndromes. However; there is limited information on the utilization and efficacy of CAM therapy in primary care patients receiving long-term opioid therapy. METHOD: A survey of CAM therapy was conducted with a systematic sample of 908 primary care patients receiving opioids as a primary treatment method for chronic pain. Subjects completed a questionnaire designed to assess utilization, efficacy and costs of CAM therapies in this population. RESULTS: Patients were treated for a variety of pain problems including low back pain (38.4%), headaches (9.9%), and knee pain (6.5%); the average duration of pain was 16 years. The median morphine equivalent opioid dose was 41 mg/day, and the mean dose was 92 mg/day. Forty-four percent of the sample reported CAM therapy use in the past 12 months. Therapies utilized included massage therapy (27.3%, n = 248), chiropractic treatment (17.8%, n = 162), acupuncture (7.6%, n = 69), yoga (6.1%, n = 55), herbs and supplements (6.8%, n = 62), and prolotherapy (5.9%, n = 54). CAM utilization was significantly related to age female gender, pain severity income pain diagnosis of neck and upper back pain, and illicit drug use. Medical insurance covered chiropractic treatment (81.8%) and prolotherapy (87.7%), whereas patients primarily paid for other CAM therapies. Over half the sample reported that one or more of the CAM therapies were helpful. CONCLUSION: This study suggests CAM therapy is widely used by patients receiving opioids for chronic pain. Whether opioids can be reduced by introducing such therapies remains to be studied.	Fleming, Sara;Rabago, David P;Mundt, Marlon P;Fleming, Michael F	2007 May 16
17501846	Effectiveness of yoga therapy in the treatment of migraine without aura: a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have explored the effectiveness of complementary and alternative medicine in the treatment of migraine but there is no documented investigation of the effectiveness of yoga therapy for migraine management. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effectiveness of holistic approach of yoga therapy for migraine treatment compared to self-care. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Seventy-two patients with migraine without aura were randomly assigned to yoga therapy or self-care group for 3 months. Primary outcomes were headache frequency (headache diary), severity of migraine (0-10 numerical scale) and pain component (McGill pain questionnaire). Secondary outcomes were anxiety and depression (Hospital anxiety depression scale), medication score. RESULTS: After adjustment for baseline values, the subjects' complaints related to headache intensity (P < .001), frequency (P < .001), pain rating index (P < .001), affective pain rating index (P < .001), total pain rating index (P < .001), anxiety and depression scores (P < .001), symptomatic medication use (P < .001) were significantly lower in the yoga group compared to the self-care group. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated a significant reduction in migraine headache frequency and associated clinical features, in patients treated with yoga over a period of 3 months. Further study of this therapeutic intervention appears to be warranted.	John, P J;Sharma, Neha;Sharma, Chandra M;Kankane, Arvind	2007 May
17496071	Rectus sheath haematoma: a rare presentation of non-contact strenuous exercises.	Rectus sheath haematoma (RSH) is a well-documented but uncommon clinical condition. It is usually a self-limiting condition but can present as a life-threatening emergency. RSH after non-contact vigorous exercise is unknown. Two such cases secondary to yoga and laughter therapy sessions, respectively, are reported. One of them required surgical intervention, whereas the other was successfully treated conservatively.

17490849	[Irritable bowel syndrome: current treatment options].	Relieving abdominal pain is the principal treatment objective for patients with irritable bowel syndrome. No single drug stands out in the treatment strategy for this illness. Antispasmodics, magnesium aluminum silicates, and alverine citrate drugs all remain initial options for treatment, although their prescription is impeded by the fact that an increasing number are no longer approved for reimbursement. Increased dietary fibers often have a harmful effect on symptoms. Some patients are probably intolerant to some foods but there is no satisfactory proof on which to base a restrictive diet. Improved knowledge of the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome has made it possible to diversify treatments that act first on one of the key pathophysiologic elements, visceral hypersensitivity. Antidepressants (especially tricyclics) can be used at low doses. Among the serotonergic drugs, serotonin 5-HT4 receptors agonists (tegaserod) may be available soon, but the development of 5-HT3 antagonists (alosetron, cilansetron) has been stopped for safety reasons (ischemic colitis and severe constipation). Non-drug options such as hypnosis, psychotherapy, relaxation, or yoga, may also be proposed to some patients. Probiotics are a possible treatment in the future.	Ducrotte, Philippe	2007 Nov
17473145	Level-dependent coronal and axial moment-rotation corridors of degeneration-free cervical spines in lateral flexion.	BACKGROUND: Aging, trauma, or degeneration can affect intervertebral kinematics. While in vivo studies can determine motions, moments are not easily quantified. Previous in vitro studies on the cervical spine have largely used specimens from older individuals with varying levels of degeneration and have shown that moment-rotation responses under lateral bending do not vary significantly by spinal level. The objective of the present in vitro biomechanical study was, therefore, to determine the coronal and axial moment-rotation responses of degeneration-free, normal, intact human cadaveric cervicothoracic spinal columns under the lateral bending mode. METHODS: Nine human cadaveric cervical columns from C2 to T1 were fixed at both ends. The donors had ranged from twenty-three to forty-four years old (mean, thirty-four years) at the time of death. Retroreflective targets were inserted into each vertebra to obtain rotational kinematics in the coronal and axial planes. The specimens were subjected to pure lateral bending moment with use of established techniques. The range-of-motion and neutral zone metrics for the coronal and axial rotation components were determined at each level of the spinal column and were evaluated statistically. RESULTS: Statistical analysis indicated that the two metrics were level-dependent (p < 0.05). Coronal motions were significantly greater (p < 0.05) than axial motions. Moment-rotation responses were nonlinear for both coronal and axial rotation components under lateral bending moments. Each segmental curve for both rotation components was well represented by a logarithmic function (R(2) > 0.95). CONCLUSIONS: Range-of-motion metrics compared favorably with those of in vivo investigations. Coronal and axial motions of degeneration-free cervical spinal columns under lateral bending showed substantially different level-dependent responses. The presentation of moment-rotation corridors for both metrics forms a normative dataset for the degeneration-free cervical spines.

17447865	Physical activity and mental health outcomes during menopause: a randomized controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Many women experience detriments in mental health during the menopausal transition. Physical activity may attenuate these adverse outcomes but few studies investigating such effects exist. PURPOSE: This study examined the effects of a 4-month randomized controlled exercise trial on mental health outcomes in 164 previously low-active middle-aged women (M age = 49.9; SD = 3.6). METHODS AND RESULTS: Participants completed body composition and fitness assessment and a battery of psychological measures at the beginning and end of a 4-month randomized controlled exercise trial with three arms: walking, yoga, control. The results indicated that walking and yoga were effective in enhancing positive affect and menopause-related QOL and reducing negative affect. Women who experienced decreases in menopausal symptoms across the trial also experienced improvements in all positive mental health and QOL outcomes and reductions in negative mental health outcomes. Whether menopausal symptoms increased or decreased across the trial appeared to be determined in part by whether there were increases or decreases in cardiorespiratory fitness. CONCLUSIONS: Physical activity appears to enhance mood and menopause-related QOL during menopause, however, other aspects of mental health may be affected only as a result of reduction in menopausal symptoms. Increasing cardiorespiratory fitness could be one way to reduce menopausal symptoms.	Elavsky, Steriani;McAuley, Edward	2007 Apr
17428596	The 'world of yoga': the production and reproduction of therapeutic landscapes.	Yoga is becoming more and more fashionable all around the world. This activity, partly considered as therapeutic, reveals contemporary ways of producing global practices. Via a questionnaire completed by individuals at yoga centres in India and France, the paper analyses this phenomenon using the concept of therapeutic landscapes. Furthermore, it examines how these therapeutic landscapes are influenced by globalisation. Bringing together the concepts of therapeutic landscapes, globalisation and the practice of yoga, the paper analyses the production and reproduction of yogic therapeutic landscapes in the world's space. Constituted of natural physical elements and built structures, these therapeutic landscapes are also strongly linked to emotional qualities and intimate feelings evoked by the place and related to health and well-being. The paper also underlines that the emergence of internationally recognised therapeutic landscapes demands a cultural and social geographical approach that could help to examine the repercussions of local and global phenomena on therapeutic landscapes. Indeed, very often, yogis, all around the world, refer to ideal places where they rarely go. Consequently, they create an imagined therapeutic environment that the paper describes.

17402267	Effect of Sahaj Yoga on neuro-cognitive functions in patients suffering from major depression.	Cognitive functions are impaired in Major Depression. Studies on the effects of Yoga on cognitive functions have shown improvement in memory, vigilance and anxiety levels. 30 patients suffering from Major depression (age 18 to 45 years) were randomly divided into two groups: Group 1: (10 males and 5 Females) Patients who practised Sahaj Yoga meditation and also received conventional anti-depressant medication. Group 2: (9 males and 6 Females) Patients who only received conventional antidepressant medication. Group 1 patients were administered Sahaj Yoga practice for 8 weeks. Neuro-cognitive test battery consisting of Letter cancellation test (LCT), Trail making test 'A' (TTA), Trail making test 'B' (TTB), Ruff figural fluency test (RFFT), Forward digit span (FDS) & Reverse digit span test (RDS) was used to assess following cognitive domains: Attention span, visuo-motor speed, short-term memory, working memory and executive functions. After 8 weeks, both Group 1 and Group 2 subjects showed significant improvement in LCT, TTA & TTB but improvement in LCT was more marked in Group 1 subjects. Also, there was significant improvement in RDS scores in only Group 1 subjects (P < 0.05). The results thereby, demonstrate that Sahaj Yoga practice in addition to the improvement in various other cognitive domains seen with conventional anti-depressants, can lead to additional improvement in executive functions like manipulation of information in the verbal working memory and added improvement in attention span and visuo-motor speed of the depressives.

17388764	Use of complementary and alternative medicine for weight control in the United States.	OBJECTIVES: The purpose was to assess the prevalence and correlates of complementary and alternative medicine use for weight control. DESIGN: A list-assisted random-digit-dialed telephone survey of adults was conducted in the fall of 2002 (n = 11,211). The focus of the study was complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use, other than dietary supplements, in the previous 12 months. SETTINGS/LOCATION: The sample of respondents was drawn from the total noninstitutionalized U.S. adult population residing in telephone-equipped locations. SUBJECTS: The sampling procedures were designed to obtain adequate representation of Hispanic and non-Hispanic black respondents. Data from the total sample of 11,211 were weighted to achieve an estimate of the U.S. population. Analyses focused on 372 people who had used CAM within the previous 12 months. RESULTS: Of the total, 3.3% (n = 372) had used a CAM therapy in the previous 12 months. Higher adjusted odds ratios for CAM use were found among respondents who were exercising for weight control; using a lower carbohydrate, higher protein diet; using a nonprescription weight-loss product(s); overweight; physically active; and not satisfied with one's body (adjusted for age, race, gender, education, and city size). The most often used therapies were yoga (57.4%), meditation (8.2%), acupuncture (7.7%), massage (7.5%), and Eastern martial arts (5.9%). CAM users used CAM therapies on their own (62.6%), in a group setting (26.8%) or with a CAM practitioner (10.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The use of CAM therapies other than dietary supplements for weight loss was relatively low. The most popular therapy was yoga, and the majority of CAM users used CAM therapies on their own. Persons who had used other weight loss methods had greater odds for using CAM in the previous 12 months, suggesting that CAM use is often added to other weight-loss strategies.

17370019	Neuroscience of meditation.	Dhyana-Yoga is a Sanskrit word for the ancient discipline of meditation, as a means to Samadhi or enlightenment. Samadhi is a self-absorptive, adaptive state with realization of one's being in harmony with reality. It is unitive, undifferentiated, reality-consciousness, an essential being, which can only be experienced by spontaneous intuition and self-understanding. Modern neuroscience can help us to better understand Dhyana-Yoga. This article discusses topics including brain-mind-reality, consciousness, attention, emotional intelligence, sense of self, meditative mind, and meditative brain. A new hypothesis is proposed for a better understanding of the meditative mind. Meditation is an art of being serene and alert in the present moment, instead of constantly struggling to change or to become. It is an art of efficient management of attentional energy with total engagement (poornata, presence, mindfulness) or disengagement (shunyata, silence, emptiness). In both states, there is an experience of spontaneous unity with no sense of situational interactive self or personal time. It is a simultaneous, participatory consciousness rather than a dualistic, sequential attentiveness. There is a natural sense of well being with self-understanding, spontaneous joy, serenity, freedom, and self-fulfillment. It is where the ultimate pursuit of happiness and the search for meaning of life resolve. One realizes the truth of one's harmonious being in nature and nature in oneself. It is being alive at its fullest, when each conscious moment becomes a dynamic process of discovery and continuous learning of the ever-new unfolding reality.	Deshmukh, Vinod D	2006 Nov 16
17369805	Martial arts as sport and therapy.	The term Martial Arts is often used as general phrase to describe many of the combat arts, which have developed in eastern cultures over the past millennium. This paper reviews the Martial Arts from the original context of a trio of life skills. This trio includes the healing arts such as acupuncture, the self-exploration arts such as yoga, and the vital life skills such as meditation. As Martial Arts suggests the waging of combat, the origins of the most common combat arts are reviewed, with an overview of the difference between the hard and the soft styles. The arts developed not only in the eastern, but also in all parts of the world, with references of these types of combats arts in the writings of the ancient Egyptians and Greeks. In modern times, the combat arts are performed for both exercise and sport. A review of the injuries that occur, and the health benefits that might be expected are discussed. A review of the medical literature that demonstrates some of these health benefits is included, with Tai Chi Chuan as the most studied of these. The health benefits discussed include strengthen and self-efficacy of the elderly, reduced falls, increased exercise capacity, and benefits to the immune system and autonomic nervous system. The paper emphasized the breadth of the Martial Arts and the import of these to the sports and health community.	Burke, D T;Al-Adawi, S;Lee, Y T;Audette, J	2007 Mar

17351022	A critical review of complementary therapies for cancer-related fatigue.	PURPOSE: To review the available literature on the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) treatments for cancer-related fatigue with an aim to develop directions for future research. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and SPORTDiscus were searched for relevant studies. Original clinical trials reporting on the use of CAM treatments for cancer-related fatigue were abstracted and critically reviewed. RESULTS: CAM interventions tested for cancer-related fatigue include acupuncture, aromatherapy, adenosine triphosphate infusions, energy conservation and activity management, healing touch, hypnosis, lectin-standardized mistletoe extract, levocarnitine, massage, mindfulness-based stress reduction, polarity therapy, relaxation, sleep promotion, support group, and Tibetan yoga. Several of these interventions seem promising in initial studies. CONCLUSION: Currently, insufficient data exist to recommend any specific CAM modality for cancer-related fatigue. Therefore, potentially effective CAM interventions ready for further study in large, randomized clinical trials (eg, acupuncture, massage, levocarnitine, and the use of mistletoe) should be pursued. Other interventions should be tested in well-designed feasibility and phase II trials.	Sood, Amit;Barton, Debra L;Bauer, Brent A;Loprinzi, Charles L	2007 Mar
17349503	Yoga for women with metastatic breast cancer: results from a pilot study.	Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remains a terminal illness for which major treatment advances are slow to appear, and hence it is crucial that effective palliative interventions be developed to reduce the cancer-related symptoms of women with this condition during the remaining years of their lives. This pilot/feasibility study examined a novel, yoga-based palliative intervention, the Yoga of Awareness Program, in a sample of women with MBC. The eight-week protocol included gentle yoga postures, breathing exercises, meditation, didactic presentations, and group interchange. Outcome was assessed using daily measures of pain, fatigue, distress, invigoration, acceptance, and relaxation during two preintervention weeks and the final two weeks of the intervention. Thirteen women completed the intervention (mean age=59; mean time since diagnosis=7 years; two African American, 11 Caucasian). During the study, four participants had cancer recurrences, and the physical condition of several others deteriorated noticeably. Despite low statistical power, pre-to-post multilevel outcomes analyses showed significant increases in invigoration and acceptance. Lagged analyses of length of home yoga practice (controlling for individual mean practice time and outcome levels on the lagged days) showed that on the day after a day during which women practiced more, they experienced significantly lower levels of pain and fatigue, and higher levels of invigoration, acceptance, and relaxation. These findings support the need for further investigation of the effects of the Yoga of Awareness Program in women with MBC.

17336473	A pilot study of a Hatha yoga treatment for menopausal symptoms.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and efficacy of a yoga treatment for menopausal symptoms. Both physiologic and self-reported measures of hot flashes were included. METHODS: A prospective within-group pilot study was conducted. Participants were 12 peri- and post-menopausal women experiencing at least 4 menopausal hot flashes per day, at least 4 days per week. Assessments were administered before and after completion of a 10-week yoga program. Pre- and post-treatment measures included: Severity of questionnaire-rated menopausal symptoms (Wiklund Symptom Check List), frequency, duration, and severity of hot flashes (24-h ambulatory skin-conductance monitoring; hot-flash diary), interference of hot flashes with daily life (Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale), and subjective sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). Yoga classes included breathing techniques, postures, and relaxation poses designed specifically for menopausal symptoms. Participants were asked to practice at home 15 min each day in addition to weekly classes. RESULTS: Eleven women completed the study and attended a mean of 7.45 (S.D. 1.63) classes. Significant pre- to post-treatment improvements were found for severity of questionnaire-rated total menopausal symptoms, hot-flash daily interference; and sleep efficiency, disturbances, and quality. Neither 24-h monitoring nor accompanying diaries yielded significant changes in hot flashes. CONCLUSIONS: The yoga treatment and study procedures were feasible for midlife women. Improvement in symptom perceptions and well being warrant further study of yoga for menopausal symptoms, with a larger number of women and including a control group.

17326495	Emotional well-being of college students in health courses with and without an exercise component.	This study was designed to examine the effects of exercise on indices of emotional well-being of 584 college students enrolled in either a lecture-only health course or one of six health-fitness courses, each using a different mode of exercise including cross-training, aerobics, yoga, circuit weight training, swimming, and walk/jog. Each participant completed the Self-perception Profile for College Students developed by Neeman and Harter. Analysis yielded significant differences on five indices of emotional well-being (Global Self-worth, Appearance, Romantic Relationships, Social Acceptance, and Athletic Competence) between pre- and posttest scores of participants enrolled in the health-fitness courses, while no differences were found between pre-and posttest scores of participants enrolled in the lecture-only health course. Of the seven subscales examined, a significant interaction effect was found between sex/time and Romantic Relationships/Athletic Competence, with women reporting greater gains than men.

17323612	[Psychotropic effects of physical activity].	Physical activity can improve mental health. Positive effect of physical activity on depression and anxiety are mentioned. Moreover physical activity increases resistance against memory loss during aging. Physical activity also improves quality and life satisfaction in all age group; this fact was confirmed also in Czech children. Physical activity should be sufficient, but not excessive, and it should be combined with pharmacotherapy in severe and long-term depression. The kind of physical activity depends on the preferences and possibilities of patients; walking, yoga, swimming, etc. are usually appropriate.	Nespor, K;Csemy, L	2006
17310659	Assessing depression following two ancient Indian interventions: effects of yoga and ayurveda on older adults in a residential home.	The effects of yoga and ayurveda on geriatric depression were evaluated in 69 persons older than 60 who were living in a residential home. Participants were stratified by age and gender and randomly allocated to three groups: Yoga, Ayurveda, or Wait-list Control. The 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale was used to assess depressive symptoms prior to the intervention, and after 3 months and 6 months post-intervention. Participation in one of the three groups lasted 24 weeks. The yoga program (7 hours 30 minutes per week) included physical postures, relaxation techniques, regulated breathing, devotional songs, and lectures. The Ayurveda Group received an herbal preparation twice daily for the whole period. The depression symptom scores of the Yoga Group at both 3 and 6 months decreased significantly, from a group average baseline of 10.6 to 8.1 and 6.7, respectively (p < .001, paired t-test). The other groups showed no change. Hence, an integrated approach of yoga including the mental and philosophical aspects in addition to the physical practices was useful for institutionalized older persons.

17291207	Development and evaluation of a yoga exercise programme for older adults.	AIM: This study reports the development and evaluation of a new yoga exercise programme for older adults, called the Silver Yoga Programme. BACKGROUND: Yoga practice is associated with numerous health improvements, including reduced cardiovascular risk, body mass index and blood pressure. Yoga is also associated with improved respiration, psychological health and pain management. Studies have suggested the beneficial effects of yoga in the older population. METHOD: The study was conducted in 2005 and it had two phases. Phase I consisted of sending a survey to 10 experts to help develop the Silver Yoga Programme. A hard copy and a video containing detailed descriptions and demonstrations of the programme were then sent to the experts for review and critique regarding the clarity and feasibility of the yoga postures. Phase II was an enquiry into older adults' views on the programme using a quantitative evaluation and semi-structured qualitative inquiry. Fourteen women participants from a senior activity centre were interviewed individually after 1 month of Silver Yoga group practice, three times per week, 70 minutes per session. They were asked to evaluate the appropriateness of postures based on the criteria of difficulty, acceptability, feasibility and helpfulness. Five open-ended questions asked participants to reflect on their yoga experiences. RESULTS: Participants' mean ratings of the acceptability, feasibility and helpfulness of the four aspects of the programme (warm-up, Hatha yoga, relaxation and guided-imagery meditation) ranged from 8.8 +/- 1.9 to 9.3 +/- 1.5; mean ratings of the difficulty of the programme revealed that relaxation and guided-imagery meditation were fairly easy to follow (0.1 +/- 0.3 and 0.1 +/- 0.3 respectively), but the postures in the Hatha yoga were relatively challenging (2.1 +/- 2.6). CONCLUSION: The Silver Yoga Programme should undergo further pilot-testing with larger samples of older adults before it is taken up internationally as a health-promotion activity for older adults.

17276961	Progression of glaucoma associated with the Sirsasana (headstand) yoga posture.	This article reports a case of progressive glaucomatous optic neuropathy and visual field loss that occurred in a patient who practiced the Sirsasana (headstand) yoga posture on a daily basis for many years. Visual field analysis was performed through standard automated perimetry. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured through pneumotonometry in the sitting position and in the head-down position. Stereo-optic disc photographs were obtained. IOP increased significantly in the head-down position. Optic disc evaluation revealed a new disc hemorrhage in the left eye. Visual field analysis over a period of 2 y showed progression of a superior arcuate defect in the left eye. Transient increases in IOP associated with the yoga headstand posture may lead to progressive glaucomatous optic nerve damage and visual field loss.

17273582	Yoga versus aerobic activity: effects on spirometry results and maximal inspiratory pressure.	OBJECTIVE: To clarify whether, in healthy individuals, practicing yoga can modify maximal inspiratory pressure and spirometric indices when compared with the practice of aerobic exercise. MEYHODS: A controlled clinical trial. A total of 31 healthy volunteers were allocated to practice aerobic exercise (n = 15) or to practice yoga (n = 16). Those in the first group served as controls and engaged in aerobic exercise for 45-60 minutes, twice a week for three months. Those in the second group practiced selected yogic techniques, also in sessions of 45-60 minutes, twice a week for three months. Forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in one second and maximal inspiratory pressure were measured before and after the three months of training. RESULTS: No significant alterations were seen in the spirometric indices. A slight, although not significant, improvement in maximal inspiratory pressure was seen in both groups. However, there was a significant difference, seen in both genders, between the absolute delta (final value minus baseline value) of maximal inspiratory pressure for the group practicing yoga and that obtained for the group engaging in aerobic exercise (males: 19.5 cm H2O versus 2.8 cm H2O, p = 0.05; females: 20 cm H2O versus 3.9 cm H2O, p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Neither yoga nor aerobic exercise provided a statistically significant improvement in maximal inspiratory pressure after three months. However, the absolute variation in maximal inspiratory pressure was greater among those practicing yoga.	de Godoy, Dagoberto Vanoni;Bringhenti, Raquel Longhi;Severa, Andrea;de Gasperi, Ricardo;Poli, Leonardo Vieira	2006 Mar-Apr

17253549	Cognitive behavioural therapy for tinnitus.	BACKGROUND: Tinnitus is an auditory perception that can be described as the experience of sound, in the ear or in the head, in the absence of external acoustic stimulation (not usually audible to anyone else). At present no specific therapy for tinnitus is acknowledged to be satisfactory in all patients. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) uses relaxation, cognitive restructuring of the thoughts and exposure to exacerbating situations in order to promote habituation and may benefit tinnitus patients, as may the treatment of associated psychological conditions. OBJECTIVES: To assess whether cognitive behavioural therapy is effective in the management of patients suffering from tinnitus. SEARCH STRATEGY: Our search included the Cochrane ENT Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2006), MEDLINE and EMBASE. The last search date was June 2006. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials in which patients with unilateral or bilateral tinnitus as main symptom received cognitive behavioural treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One review author (PMD) assessed every report identified by the search strategy. The four review authors assessed the methodological quality, applied inclusion/exclusion criteria and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Six trials comprising 285 participants were included. 1. PRIMARY OUTCOME: subjective tinnitus loudness. CBT compared to a waiting list control group: we found no significant difference (Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) 0.06 (95% CI -0.25 to 0.37)). CBT compared to another intervention (Yoga, Education, Minimal Contact - Education and Education): we found no significant difference (SMD 0.1 (95% CI -0.22 to 0.42)).2. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: a) Depression. CBT compared to a waiting list control group: we found no significant difference in either group (SMD 0.29 (95%CI -0.04 to 0.63)). CBT compared to another intervention (Yoga, Education and Minimal Contact - Education): we found no significant difference (SMD 0.01 (95% CI -0.43 to 0.45)). b) Quality of life: CBT compared to a waiting list control group: we found a significant difference in favour of CBT versus the waiting list group (SMD 0.7 (95% CI 0.33 to 1.08)). CBT compared to another intervention (Education, Minimal Contact - Education and Education): we also found a significant difference between CBT and the other intervention control group (SMD 0.64 (95% CI 0.29 to 1.00)). There were no adverse/side effects reported in any trial. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We did not find a significant difference in the subjective loudness of tinnitus, or in the associated depression. However we found a significant improvement in the quality of life (decrease of global tinnitus severity) of the participants, thus suggesting that cognitive behavioural therapy has an effect on the qualitative aspects of tinnitus and contributes positively to the management of tinnitus.

17230607	Yoga: a tool for improving the quality of life in chronic pancreatitis.	AIM: To determine the effectiveness of yoga on improving the quality of life in patients of chronic pancreatitis. METHODS: The patients were randomized to two groups. The control group continued their usual care as directed by their physicians. Patients in the yoga group, in addition, received biweekly yoga sessions for 12 wk. The patients' demographic and health behaviour variables were assessed before and after the yoga programme using Medical Outcomes Short Form (SF-36) for quality of life, Profile of Mood States for assessing mood and Symptoms of Stress Inventory for measuring stress. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients were enrolled, with 8 drop-outs. Thirty patients were randomized to the yoga group and 30 to the control group. Significant improvements were seen in overall quality of life, symptoms of stress, mood changes, alcohol dependence and appetite after the 12 wk period apart from the general feeling of well-being and desire to continue with the programme in future in the yoga group, while there was no difference in the control group. CONCLUSION: Yoga is effective on improving the quality of life in patients of chronic pancreatitis.	Sareen, Surinder;Kumari, Vinita;Gajebasia, Karaminder-Singh;Gajebasia, Nimanpreet-Kaur	2007 Jan 21
17224851	Lack of perceived sleep improvement after 4-month structured exercise programs.	OBJECTIVE: Many middle-aged women experience decreases in their sleep quality during the menopausal transition. Physical activity has been shown to improve sleep, but few randomized, controlled trials investigating such effects in this population exist. In 164 previously low-active middle-aged women (mean age = 49.9, SD = 3.6), using a 4-month randomized, controlled trial, we examined structured exercise in the form of walking or yoga to determine the effects on perceived sleep quality. DESIGN: Participants completed body composition and fitness assessments and a battery of psychological measures, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, at the beginning and end of a 4-month randomized, controlled exercise trial with three arms: walking, yoga, and control. RESULTS: A series of mixed-model repeated-measures univariate analyses of covariance did not reveal any statistically significant intervention effects for total sleep quality or any individual sleep-quality domain. The pattern of effect sizes indicated that the walking group tended to experience small improvements in five of the seven assessed sleep-quality domains. Residual changes in menopausal symptoms and depression were associated with residual changes in total sleep quality. However, after controlling for the effects of physical activity, only menopausal symptoms contributed a unique amount of variance in residual change in total sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, 4-month moderate-intensity walking and low-intensity yoga programs were ineffective in yielding statistically significant improvements in sleep quality. Exercise interventions of longer durations or greater intensity may be needed for such improvements.	Elavsky, Steriani;McAuley, Edward	2007 May-Jun
17206440	Reduced hypoxic ventilatory response with preserved blood oxygenation in yoga trainees and Himalayan Buddhist monks at altitude: evidence of a different adaptive strategy?	Yoga induces long-term changes in respiratory function and control. We tested whether it represents a successful strategy for high-altitude adaptation. We compared ventilatory, cardiovascular and hematological parameters in: 12 Caucasian yoga trainees and 12 control sea-level residents, at baseline and after 2-week exposure to high altitude (Pyramid Laboratory, Nepal, 5,050 m), 38 active lifestyle high-altitude natives (Sherpas) and 13 contemplative lifestyle high-altitude natives with practice of yoga-like respiratory exercises (Buddhist monks) studied at 5,050 m. At baseline, hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR), red blood cell count and hematocrit were lower in Caucasian yoga trainees than in controls. After 14 days at altitude, yoga trainees showed similar oxygen saturation, blood pressure, RR interval compared to controls, but lower HVR (-0.44 +/- 0.08 vs. -0.98 +/- 0.21 l/min/m/%SaO(2), P < 0.05), minute ventilation (8.3 +/- 0.9 vs. 10.8 +/- 1.6 l/min, P < 0.05), breathing rate (indicating higher ventilatory efficiency), and lower red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, albumin, erythropoietin and soluble transferrin receptors. Hypoxic ventilatory response in monks was lower than in Sherpas (-0.23 +/- 0.05 vs. -0.63 +/- 0.09 l/min/m/%SaO(2), P < 0.05); values were similar to baseline data of yoga trainees and Caucasian controls, respectively. Red blood cell count and hematocrit were lower in monks as compared to Sherpas. In conclusion, Caucasian subjects practicing yoga maintain a satisfactory oxygen transport at high altitude, with minimal increase in ventilation and with reduced hematological changes, resembling Himalayan natives. Respiratory adaptations induced by the practice of yoga may represent an efficient strategy to cope with altitude-induced hypoxia.

17176168	Peripheral neuropathy: pathogenic mechanisms and alternative therapies.	Peripheral neuropathy (PN), associated with diabetes, neurotoxic chemotherapy, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/antiretroviral drugs, alcoholism, nutrient deficiencies, heavy metal toxicity, and other etiologies, results in significant morbidity. Conventional pain medications primarily mask symptoms and have significant side effects and addiction profiles. However, a widening body of research indicates alternative medicine may offer significant benefit to this patient population. Alpha-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, benfotiamine, methylcobalamin, and topical capsaicin are among the most well-researched alternative options for the treatment of PN. Other potential nutrient or botanical therapies include vitamin E, glutathione, folate, pyridoxine, biotin, myo-inositol, omega-3 and -6 fatty acids, L-arginine, L-glutamine, taurine, N-acetylcysteine, zinc, magnesium, chromium, and St. John's wort. In the realm of physical medicine, acupuncture, magnetic therapy, and yoga have been found to provide benefit. New cutting-edge conventional therapies, including dual-action peptides, may also hold promise.	Head, Kathleen A	2006 Dec
17170669	Yoga for patients and carers in a palliative day care setting.	This study suggests that yoga can be of benefit to patients (and carers) in palliative care settings. Complementary therapies have been employed in our day care unit for several years--aromatherapy, reflexology and massage--and have grown in popularity, enabling relaxation and a feeling of well-being. For patients striving to remain physically fit and, in consultation with our physiotherapist, we felt there may be a role for a gentle form of yoga. A study of the literature yielded information on yoga and cancer but little evidence of its use in palliative care. Having identified a form of yoga that could be adapted for those with physical frailties-- Dru yoga--a 12-week pilot project was introduced into the day care unit. This proved to be highly successful and has now been incorporated as part of our therapeutic service.	McDonald, Aileen;Burjan, Elene;Martin, Sue	2006 Nov
17168187	[Stress management in the treatment of essential arterial hypertension].	Between 60 and 90% of patients consult their family doctor for stress-associated complaints. Not infrequently, a considerable number of these patients already have elevated blood pressure. The positive effect on high blood pressure of relaxation techniques has been confirmed in various studies. Accordingly, stress management should now have a permanent place in effective antihypertensive treatment. Appropriate relaxation techniques include, for example, autogenic training, progressive muscle relaxation, visualization and breathing exercises, chi gong and yoga. These practices are incorporated in various lifestyle programs. They act in different ways, and can be offered to the patient in accordance with his/her individual wishes.

17149454	A randomized trial of yoga for adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome.	BACKGROUND: Adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) frequently experience interference with everyday activities. Mind-body approaches such as yoga have been recommended as interventions for patients with IBS. Despite promising results among adult samples, there have been limited studies exploring the efficacy of yoga with pediatric patients. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a preliminary randomized study of yoga as treatment for adolescents with IBS. METHODS: Twenty-five adolescents aged 11 to 18 years with IBS were randomly assigned to either a yoga or wait list control group. Before the intervention, both groups completed questionnaires assessing gastrointestinal symptoms, pain, functional disability, coping, anxiety and depression. The yoga intervention consisted of a 1 h instructional session, demonstration and practice, followed by four weeks of daily home practice guided by a video. After four weeks, adolescents repeated the baseline questionnaires. The wait list control group then received the yoga intervention and four weeks later completed an additional set of questionnaires. RESULTS: Adolescents in the yoga group reported lower levels of functional disability, less use of emotion-focused avoidance and lower anxiety following the intervention than adolescents in the control group. When the pre- and postintervention data for the two groups were combined, adolescents had significantly lower scores for gastrointestinal symptoms and emotion-focused avoidance following the yoga intervention. Adolescents found the yoga to be helpful and indicated they would continue to use it to manage their IBS. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga holds promise as an intervention for adolescents with IBS.

17145677	Changes in p300 following two yoga-based relaxation techniques.	Cyclic meditation (CM) is a technique that combines "stimulating" and "calming" practices, based on a statement in ancient yoga texts suggesting that such a combination may be especially helpful to reach a state of mental equilibrium. The changes in the peak latency and peak amplitude of P300 auditory event-related potentials were studied before and after the practice of cyclic meditation compared to an equal duration of supine rest in 42 volunteers (group mean age +/- SD, 27 +/- 6.3 years), from Fz, Cz, and Pz electrode sites referenced to linked earlobes. The sessions were one day apart and the order was alternated. There was reduction in the peak latencies of P300 after cyclic meditation at Fz, Cz, and Pz compared to the "pre" values. A similar trend of reduction in P300 peak latencies at Fz, Cz, and Pz was also observed after supine rest, compared to the respective "pre" values, although the magnitude of change in each case was less after supine rest compared to after cyclic meditation. The P300 peak amplitudes after CM were higher at Fz, Cz, and Pz sites compared to the "pre" values. In contrast, no significant changes were observed in the P300 peak amplitudes at Fz, Cz, and Pz after supine rest compared to the respective "pre" state. The present results support the idea that "cyclic" meditation enhances cognitive processes underlying the generation of the P300.	Sarang, S P;Telles, Shirley	2006 Dec
17144787	Complementary medicine for depression.	Surveys have demonstrated that complementary medicine use for depression is widespread, although patterns of use vary. A series of systematic reviews provide a summary of the current evidence for acupuncture, aromatherapy and massage, homeopathy, meditation, reflexology, herbal medicine, yoga, and several dietary supplements and relaxation techniques. The quantity and quality of individual studies vary widely, but research interest in complementary therapies is increasing, particularly in herbal and nutritional products. Major questions are still to be answered with respect to the effectiveness and appropriate role of these therapies in the management of depression. Areas for further research and some of the potential challenges to research design are discussed. Finally, several ongoing developments in information provision on this topic are highlighted.

17140457	Effect of yoga on self-rated visual discomfort in computer users.	BACKGROUND: 'Dry eye' appears to be the main contributor to the symptoms of computer vision syndrome. Regular breaks and the use of artificial tears or certain eye drops are some of the options to reduce visual discomfort. A combination of yoga practices have been shown to reduce visual strain in persons with progressive myopia. The present randomized controlled trial was planned to evaluate the effect of a combination of yoga practices on self-rated symptoms of visual discomfort in professional computer users in Bangalore. METHODS: Two hundred and ninety one professional computer users were randomly assigned to two groups, yoga (YG, n = 146) and wait list control (WL, n = 145). Both groups were assessed at baseline and after sixty days for self-rated visual discomfort using a standard questionnaire. During these 60 days the YG group practiced an hour of yoga daily for five days in a week and the WL group did their usual recreational activities also for an hour daily for the same duration. At 60 days there were 62 in the YG group and 55 in the WL group. RESULTS: While the scores for visual discomfort of both groups were comparable at baseline, after 60 days there was a significantly decreased score in the YG group, whereas the WL group showed significantly increased scores. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the yoga practice appeared to reduce visual discomfort, while the group who had no yoga intervention (WL) showed an increase in discomfort at the end of sixty days.

17132524	Complementary treatments for tobacco cessation: a survey.	Little information is available regarding the prevalence of use and interest in future use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for tobacco cessation among tobacco users. We conducted a self-administered anonymous survey among 1,175 patients seen at a midwestern outpatient tobacco treatment specialty clinic between November 2003 and July 2005. Patient use of CAM for tobacco cessation, perceived efficacy of these treatments, and interest in future use of CAM were ascertained. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics, and logistic regression models were used to determine the characteristics associated with past CAM use or interest in future use of CAM for tobacco cessation. All of the patients who received the survey completed it. A total of 27% of patients reported previous use of CAM for tobacco cessation. The interventions most commonly used were hypnosis, relaxation, acupuncture, and meditation. CAM treatments most commonly perceived to be efficacious were yoga, relaxation, meditation, and massage therapy. A total of 67% of the patients reported interest in future use of CAM for tobacco cessation. The treatments of greatest interest for use in the future were hypnosis, herbal products, acupuncture, relaxation, and massage therapy. Female gender, previous use of conventional tobacco cessation products, previous use of CAM treatments, and a higher level of education were significantly associated with interest in future CAM use. The high level of interest in CAM among tobacco users underscores the need to conduct further research in this field.	Sood, Amit;Ebbert, Jon O;Sood, Richa;Stevens, Susanna R	2006 Dec
17122789	Lenticulostriate vasculopathy in twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome.	Intracranial pathology is a common and important complication in extremely low birth weight babies. Lenticulostriate vasculopathy (LSV) is an abnormal finding on cranial ultrasounds of sick babies and has been associated with congenital infection, chromosomal aberration and twin-to-twin transfusion. We describe a previously unreported situation of LSV being detected in both donor and recipient twin. This pair of monochorionic, diamniotic twins was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at 28 weeks of gestation. The mother underwent an emergency caesarean section because ultrasound and Doppler studies showed stage III twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. The first twin weighed 998 g and second twin weighed 600 g. The first twin had an uneventful stay, whereas the second twin needed prolonged continuous positive airway pressure and indomethacin for patent ductus arteriosus. Both of them developed LSV. The clinical significance of this condition on the neuro-developmental outcome of a neonate has not yet been fully determined.	Kandasamy, Y;Alcock, G;Koh, T H H G	2006 Dec
17109581	National patterns and correlates of complementary and alternative medicine use in adults with diabetes.	OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine national patterns and correlates of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among adults with diabetes. METHODS: The authors compared CAM use in 2474 adults with and 28,625 adults without diabetes who participated in the most comprehensive national survey on CAM use (2002 National Health Interview Survey). Eight CAM use categories were created, including dietary, herbal, chiropractic, yoga, relaxation, vitamin, prayer, and other (acupuncture, Ayurveda, biofeedback, chelation, energy healing or Reiki therapy, hypnosis, massage, naturopathy, and homeopathy). An overall CAM use category also was created that excluded vitamins and prayer. Patterns of use were compared with chi-square and independent correlates of CAM use with multiple logistic regression controlling for relevant covariates. STATA was used for analysis to account for the complex survey design. RESULTS: Prevalence of overall use of CAM did not differ significantly by diabetes status (47.6 versus 47.9%, p = 0.81). Diabetes was not an independent predictor of overall use of CAM (OR 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83, 1.05). However, persons with diabetes were more likely to use prayer (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.05, 1.36), but less likely to use herbs (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75, 0.99), yoga (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.43, 0.72), or vitamins (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72, 0.93) than people without diabetes after controlling for relevant covariates. Independent correlates of overall use of CAM differed by age, income, employment, comorbidity, and health status between people with and without diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that there has been a dramatic increase in overall use of CAM in adults with diabetes; diabetes was not an independent predictor of overall use of CAM; and people with diabetes were more likely to use prayer, but less likely to use herbs, yoga, or vitamins compared to persons without diabetes.

17097486	Feldenkrais Method, Alexander Technique, and yoga--body awareness therapy in the performing arts.	The three disciplines described are practiced by many individuals for a myriad of reasons. Depending upon ability and depth of study, teachers of all three disciplines may have specific competencies with which to analyse, instruct, and interact with students/clients. In the author's experience, persons who seek out these practices and incorporate them into their daily lives and expressions of physical activity often are motivated to maintain or establish an optimal state of well-being and function. Physicians and therapists who work with performing artists are in a position to encourage such positive direction in patients, provide information on local resources, and consider the practices as collaborative and adjunctive to medical care.

17089413	Innovative interventions for disordered eating: evaluating dissonance-based and yoga interventions.	OBJECTIVE: Eating-disordered behavior is prevalent among college women. Few interventions have successfully reduced risk factors for these behaviors, however. The most promising interventions are both selective and interactive. This study compared two newer types of interventions that meet these criteria: cognitive dissonance and yoga programs. METHOD: This study advertised programs for women who were dissatisfied with their bodies. Participants (N = 93) were randomly assigned to dissonance, yoga, or control groups. RESULTS: Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that there were no significant post-intervention differences between the yoga and control groups. Dissonance group participants had significantly lower scores than the scores of both other groups on measures of disordered eating, drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction, alexithymia, and anxiety. CONCLUSION: These findings have important implications for interventions on college campuses. In particular, dissonance interventions appear to be an efficient and inexpensive approach to reducing eating disorder risk factors. Additional research regarding the value of yoga interventions is needed.	Mitchell, Karen S;Mazzeo, Suzanne E;Rausch, Sarah M;Cooke, Kathryn L	2007 Mar
17089131	Degeneration of cardiac sympathetic nerve can occur in multiple system atrophy.	Decreased cardiac uptake of meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) on [(123)I] MIBG myocardial scintigraphy, a sensitive biological marker for Parkinson's disease (PD), is related to cardiac sympathetic denervation in patients with PD. A slight decrease in cardiac uptake of MIBG has also been reported in some patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA). However, the pathophysiological mechanism accounting for the slight decrease in MIBG uptake in MSA remains to be elucidated. For confirmation, we examined cardiac tissue and sympathetic ganglia from patients with MSA. We immunohistochemically examined each specimen of 15 patients with MSA together with 10 control subjects using antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and neurofilament (NF). The number of TH-immunoreactive nerve fibers in the epicardium was preserved in 8 of 15 patients with MSA as well as in 10 control subjects. The number of TH-immunoreactive, but not of NF-immunoreactive nerve fibers in the epicardium was mildly or moderately decreased in six patients with MSA, of whom four showed a decrease of TH immunoreactivity in the neuronal somata in the sympathetic ganglia. Moreover, TH- and NF-immunoreactive nerve fibers almost entirely disappeared in the heart of one patient with MSA, in whom Lewy body pathology was present in the sympathetic ganglia. These findings suggest that mild degeneration of the cardiac sympathetic nerve can occur in MSA which is closely related to the pathological change of neurons in the sympathetic ganglia, accounting for the slight decrease in cardiac uptake of MIBG. Moreover, concurrent Lewy body pathology in the sympathetic ganglia might accelerate cardiac sympathetic denervation even in MSA.

17088035	Postnatal development and reproductive performance of F1 progeny exposed in utero to an ayurvedic contraceptive: Pippaliyadi yoga.	Pippaliyadi yoga or pippaliyadi vati is an ayurvedic contraceptive used in India since ancient times. It is a combination of powdered fruit berries of Embelia ribes Burm.f. (Myrsinaceae), Piper longum L. (Piperaceae) and borax in equal proportion. Though the contraceptive potential is known since ancient times, no systematic developmental toxicity studies have been carried out. The present study was carried out to evaluate the postnatal developmental toxicity and the reproductive performance of the progeny exposed in utero to pippaliyadi. Pippaliyadi yoga was obtained from National Institute for Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER), India and the developmental toxicity was studied by administering three doses, viz. 140, 300 and 700 mg/(kg day) to gravid females from day 6 to day 16 of gestation. Pippaliyadi did not have any adverse developmental effects with low doses, however, with the five times higher dose, a decrease in body weight of the pups was observed. The reproductive performance of the progeny born to mothers treated with pippaliyadi was not significantly affected. The present study suggests that in utero exposure to pippaliyadi does not have any adverse effect on the postnatal development and reproductive performance of the F(1) progeny.

17082994	Tongue piercing by a Yogi: QEEG observations.	: This study reports on the QEEG observations recorded from a yogi during tongue piercing in which he demonstrated voluntary pain control. The QEEG was recorded with a Lexicor 1620 from 19 sites with appropriate controls for impedence and artifacts. A neurologist read the data for abnormalities and the QEEG was analyzed by mapping, single and multiple hertz bins, coherence, and statistical comparisons with a normative database. The session included a meditation baseline and tongue piercing. During the meditative baseline period the yogi's QEEG maps suggesting that he was able to lower his brain activity to a resting state. This state showed a predominance of slow wave potentials (delta) during piercing and suggested that the yogi induced a state that may be similar to those found when individuals are under analgesia.

17051740	Effect of a one-month yoga training program on performance in a mirror-tracing task.	The performance in a mirror star tracing task was assessed in two groups of volunteers (yoga and control) with 26 people in each group, and age range between 18 and 45 years. The star to be traced was six pointed and the outline was made up of 60 circles (4 mm in diameter). At the end of one month the yoga group showed a significant improvement in terms of an increase in the number of circles crossed (P<0.001, Wilcoxon paired signed ranks test) for both hands and a decrease in the number of circles left out for the right hand (P<0.05). The control group showed a significant increase in number of circles crossed for the left hand alone (P<0.05) at the end of a month attributed to re-test. The study suggests that one month of yoga improved reversal ability, eye-hand co-ordination, speed and accuracy which are necessary for mirror star tracing.

17042222	Bacteriology of diabetic foot lesions.	Infection plays a pivotal role in enhancing a diabetic foot at risk toward amputation. Effective antibiotic therapy against the offending pathogens is an important component of treatment of diabetic foot infections. Recognition of the pathogen is always difficult as the representative deep tissue sample for culture is surrounded by ulcer surface harbouring colonies of organisms frequently labelled as skin commensals. The emergent of resistant strains represents a compounding problem standing against efforts to prevent amputation. This study was undertaken to identify the pathogens associated with diabetic foot infection in terms of their frequency and sensitivity against certain commonly used antibiotics. Forty-four consecutive patients with open diabetic foot infections had wound swab taken for culture and sensitivity testing. Cultures positive were observed in 89% of the cases with Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeroginosa encountered in 20%, 14% and 14% of cases respectively. Mixed growths were isolated in 6% of cultures. All Staphylcoccus aureus isolates were resistant to Penicillin but 80% were sensitive to Erythromycin and Co-trimoxazole. Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were sensitive to Methicillin and Gentamycin in 80% and 60% of cases respectively, and resistant to Ampicillin and Ceftazidime in 83% and 50% respectively. All Pseudomonas aeroginosa isolates were sensitive to Amikacin and Ciprofloxacin but 50% were resistant to Gentamycin. There was no single antibiotic possessing good coverage for all common organisms isolated from diabetic foot lesions. Staphylococcus aureus remains the predominant cause of diabetic foot infections followed by Klebsiela pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeroginosa. Most infections are monomicrobial. The emergence of multiresistant organisms is a worrying feature in diabetic foot infections.	Yoga, R;Khairul, A;Sunita, K;Suresh, C	2006 Feb

17034289	Systematic review of the efficacy of meditation techniques as treatments for medical illness.	BACKGROUND: Meditative techniques are sought frequently by patients coping with medical and psychological problems. Because of their increasingly widespread appeal and use, and the potential for use as medical therapies, a concise and thorough review of the current state of scientific knowledge of these practices as medical interventions was conducted. PURPOSE: To systematically review the evidence supporting efficacy and safety of meditative practices in treating illnesses, and examine areas warranting further study. Studies on normal healthy populations are not included. METHODS: Searches were performed using PubMed, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane Database. Keywords were Meditation, Meditative Prayer, Yoga, Relaxation Response. Qualifying studies were reviewed and independently rated based on quality by two reviewers. Mid-to-high-quality studies (those scoring above 0.65 or 65% on a validated research quality scale) were included. RESULTS: From a total of 82 identified studies, 20 randomized controlled trials met our criteria. The studies included 958 subjects total (397 experimentally treated, 561 controls). No serious adverse events were reported in any of the included or excluded clinical trials. Serious adverse events are reported in the medical literature, though rare. The strongest evidence for efficacy was found for epilepsy, symptoms of the premenstrual syndrome and menopausal symptoms. Benefit was also demonstrated for mood and anxiety disorders, autoimmune illness, and emotional disturbance in neoplastic disease. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the safety and potential efficacy of meditative practices for treating certain illnesses, particularly in nonpsychotic mood and anxiety disorders. Clear and reproducible evidence supporting efficacy from large, methodologically sound studies is lacking.	Arias, Albert J;Steinberg, Karen;Banga, Alok;Trestman, Robert L	2006 Oct
17030295	Complementary and alternative medicine use in British Columbia--a survey of HIV positive people on antiretroviral therapy.	In 2002, the British Columbia (BC) Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS collected final detailed data on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use in their HIV treatment program. This cross-sectional study of 682 participants examines types and determinants of CAM use in this program, and examines adverse effects associated with CAM use and antiretroviral therapy (ART). Among the 47% ever CAM users in the included population, vitamins/minerals (81%), meditation/yoga (36%), massage (31%), marijuana (30%), dietary supplements (24%), and herbal medicines (19%), were most commonly used. Multivariate analysis indicated CAM users were less likely to have low education (AOR=0.51), more likely to be unemployed (AOR=1.52), more likely to have been on ART longer (AOR=1.19), and more likely to experience objective, action-requiring (OA) side effects (AOR=1.45). CAM use is common. Both patients and health professionals should be aware of potential toxicities and drug interactions related to the use of CAM and HIV/AIDS treatment.

17007170	The effect of a six-week program of yoga and meditation on brachial artery reactivity: do psychosocial interventions affect vascular tone?	BACKGROUND: Chronic stress is estimated to increase the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events two-fold. Although stress reduction has been linked to a reduction in CV events, little is known regarding its exact mechanism of benefit. HYPOTHESIS: Yoga and meditation will improve parameters of endothelial function. METHODS: We examined the effects of yoga and meditation on hemodynamic and laboratory parameters as well as on endothelial function in a 6-week pilot study. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures, heart rate, body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose, lipids, hs C-reactive protein (CRP), and endothelial function (as assessed by brachial artery reactivity) were all studied at baseline and after 6 weeks of yoga practice. RESULTS: A course in yoga and meditation was given to the subjects for 1.5 h three times weekly for 6 weeks and subjects were instructed to continue their efforts at home. This prospective cohort study included 33 subjects (mean age 55 +/- 11 years) both with (30%) and without (70%) established coronary artery disease (CAD). There were significant reductions in blood pressure, heart rate, and BMI in the total cohort with yoga. None of the laboratory parameters changed significantly with yoga. For the total cohort there was no significant improvement in endothelial-dependent vasodilatation with yoga training and meditation compared with baseline (16.7% relative improvement from 7.2-8.4%; p = 0.3). In the group with CAD, endothelial-dependent vasodilatation improved 69% with yoga training (6.38-10.78%; p = 0.09). CONCLUSION: Yoga and meditation appear to improve endothelial function in subjects with CAD.

17006872	A systematic review of intervention studies about anxiety in caregivers of people with dementia.	BACKGROUND: There is considerable literature on managing depression, burden and psychological morbidity in caregivers of people with dementia (CG). Anxiety has been a relatively neglected outcome measure but may require specific interventions. OBJECTIVE: To synthesise evidence regarding interventions that reduce anxiety in CGs. METHODS: Twenty-four studies met our inclusion criteria. We rated the methodology of studies, and awarded grades of recommendation (GR) for each type of intervention according to Centre for Evidence Based Medicine guidelines, from A (highest level of evidence) to D. RESULTS: Anxiety level was the primary outcome measure in only one study and no studies were predicated on a power calculation for anxiety level. There was little evidence of efficacy for any intervention. The only RCT to report significantly reduced anxiety involved a CBT and relaxation-based intervention specifically devised to treat anxiety, and there was preliminary evidence (no randomised controlled trials) that caregiver groups involving yoga and relaxation without CBT were effective. There was grade B evidence that behavioural management, exercise therapies and respite were ineffective. LIMITATIONS: Many interventions were heterogeneous, so there is some overlap between groups. Lack of evidence of efficacy is not evidence of lack of efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: CBT and other therapies developed primarily to target depression did not effectively treat anxiety. Good RCTs are needed to specifically target anxiety which might include relaxation techniques. Some of the interventions focussed on reducing contact with the care recipients but caregivers may want to cope with caring and preliminary evidence suggests strategies to help CGs manage caring demands may be more effective.

17000582	Factors associated with the use of complementary medicine and non-pharmacological interventions in symptomatic menopausal women.	BACKGROUND: Hormone replacement therapy is now thought to have serious adverse effects; consequently, many menopausal women are seeking to use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), including non-pharmacological interventions (NPI), to alleviate symptoms. The prevalence and perceived effectiveness of CAM and NPI for ameliorating menopausal symptoms are not widely known and factors likely to predict CAM and NPI utilization for menopausal symptom management have not been comprehensively documented. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to (1) determine the prevalence of using CAM and NPI for menopausal symptoms; (2) describe the perceived effectiveness of CAM and NPI for symptom management; and (3) investigate lifestyle and demographic factors associated with CAM/NPI use among menopausal women with vasomotor symptoms. METHODS: Women aged 46-55 years were recruited via six socioeconomically diverse general practices. Participants completed a postal questionnaire that contained items relating to demographics, lifestyle factors, weight, height, exercise behavior, menopausal status, vasomotor symptoms and utilization and perceived effectiveness of a range of CAM/NPI for symptom management. RESULTS: Of 1,206 women who responded, 563 (47%) were symptomatic. The most commonly used CAM/NPI for symptom management were diet/nutrition (44.3%), exercise/yoga (41.5%), relaxation/stress management (27.4%) and homeopathic/naturopathic remedies (25.4%). Of women who used these interventions, large proportions reported them to be helpful. The characteristics that were independently associated with use of CAM/NPI were White ethnicity, being physically active, and not smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Many menopausal symptomatic women are using a wide range of CAM/NPI and report these to be effective, particularly those who are white, physically active and do not smoke.

16979311	Feasibility and acceptability of restorative yoga for treatment of hot flushes: a pilot trial.	OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility and acceptability of a restorative yoga intervention for the treatment of hot flushes in postmenopausal women. METHODS: A pilot trial in 14 postmenopausal women experiencing > or =4 moderate to severe hot flushes per day or > or =30 moderate to severe hot flushes per week. The intervention consisted of eight restorative yoga poses taught in a 3-h introductory session and 8 weekly 90-min sessions. Feasibility was measured by recruitment rates, subject retention and adherence. Acceptability was assessed by subject interview and questionnaires. Efficacy measures included change in frequency and severity of hot flushes as recorded on a 7-day diary. RESULTS: Recruitment was accomplished as planned. The majority of study subjects (93%) completed the trial. Of those who completed the trial, 92% attended seven or more of the eight yoga sessions. The majority of the subjects were satisfied with the study and 75% continued to practice yoga 3 months after the study. Mean number of hot flushes per week decreased by 30.8% (95% CI 15.6-45.9%) and mean hot flush score decreased 34.2% (95% CI 16.0-52.5%) from baseline to week 8. No adverse events were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial demonstrates that it is feasible to teach restorative yoga to middle-aged women without prior yoga experience. The high rates of subject retention and satisfaction suggest that yoga is an acceptable intervention in this population. Our results indicate that a larger, randomized controlled trial to explore the efficacy of restorative yoga for treatment of menopausal symptoms would be safe and feasible.

16956851	The Strength-Focused and Meaning-Oriented Approach to Resilience and Transformation (SMART): A body-mind-spirit approach to trauma management.	This article introduces the Strength-focused and Meaning- oriented Approach to Resilience and Transformation (SMART) as a model of crisis intervention, which aims at discovering inner strengths through meaning reconstruction. Limitations of conventional crisis management and current findings in post-traumatic growth research are discussed. Instead of adopting a pathological framework, the SMART approach holds a holistic view of health, employs facilitative strategies, and promotes dynamic coping. Intervention components include Eastern spiritual teachings, physical techniques such as yoga and meditation, and psycho-education that promotes meaning reconstruction. Efficacy of the SMART model is assessed with reference to two pilot studies conducted in Hong Kong at the time when the SARS pandemic caused widespread fear and anxiety in the community. Response to potential criticisms of the SMART model is attempted.	Chan, Cecilia L W;Chan, Timothy H Y;Ng, Siv Man	2006
16945127	The effect of long term combined yoga practice on the basal metabolic rate of healthy adults.	BACKGROUND: Different procedures practiced in yoga have stimulatory or inhibitory effects on the basal metabolic rate when studied acutely. In daily life however, these procedures are usually practiced in combination. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the net change in the basal metabolic rate (BMR) of individuals actively engaging in a combination of yoga practices (asana or yogic postures, meditation and pranayama or breathing exercises) for a minimum period of six months, at a residential yoga education and research center at Bangalore. METHODS: The measured BMR of individuals practicing yoga through a combination of practices was compared with that of control subjects who did not practice yoga but led similar lifestyles. RESULTS: The BMR of the yoga practitioners was significantly lower than that of the non-yoga group, and was lower by about 13 % when adjusted for body weight (P < 0.001). This difference persisted when the groups were stratified by gender; however, the difference in BMR adjusted for body weight was greater in women than men (about 8 and 18% respectively). In addition, the mean BMR of the yoga group was significantly lower than their predicted values, while the mean BMR of non-yoga group was comparable with their predicted values derived from 1985 WHO/FAO/UNU predictive equations. CONCLUSION: This study shows that there is a significantly reduced BMR, probably linked to reduced arousal, with the long term practice of yoga using a combination of stimulatory and inhibitory yogic practices.

16932660	Complementary or alternative therapies for osteoarthritis.	Complementary or alternative therapies for osteoarthritis are commonly used and therefore it is important that health-care providers and patients are aware of the evidence for or against these approaches. In this article, the best available evidence is reviewed. The results suggest that, for several treatments, the risk-benefit profile is encouraging: acupuncture, several herbal medicines and capsaicin cream. For other therapies the evidence is weak or contradictory: homeopathy, magnet therapy, tai chi, leech therapy, music therapy, yoga, imagery and therapeutic touch. Many other treatments have not been scientifically tested. It is concluded that some complementary or alternative therapies have generated sufficiently promising results to warrant further investigation in large-scale, definitive, randomized clinical trials.

16925002	Complementary and alternative therapies: the nurse's role.	One objective of Healthy People 2010 is to increase both quality and years of healthy life. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) encompasses strategies that can help individuals meet this goal. CAM includes therapies such as acupuncture, dietary supplements, reflexology, yoga, massage, chiropractic services, Reiki, and aromatherapy. Many CAM therapies focus on the concept of energy. The literature describes the use of CAM in individuals with neurological diseases such as dementias, multiple sclerosis, neuropathies, spinal cord injury, and epilepsy. Nurses have a unique opportunity to provide services that facilitate wholeness. They need to understand all aspects of CAM, including costs, patient knowledge, and drug interactions, if they are to promote holistic strategies for patients seeking to achieve a higher quality of life.

16924579	[The use of complementary and alternative treatment in patients with asthma].	Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies such as herbal therapy, acupuncture, yoga, chiropractic, relaxation techniques, nutrition and dietary supplements, continue to gain popularity as modalities for treatment of asthma. A number of study in this area has shown frequently used CAM therapies by patients with asthma. It has found that parents who have children with asthma preferred commonly CAM therapies such as massage, relaxation techniques, diet and vitamin and that adult patients with asthma used commonly nutrition and diet supplements, herbal therapies and homeopathy. Because of many studies had weak methodology and small sample; it hasn't exposed entirely effectiveness of CAM therapies in asthma treatment. In this respect, it is required qualitative researchs with strong methodology. Furthermore; it is suggested that health professionals have to much knowledge about CAM therapies in asthma and they have to an active role in development guidelines related to CAM interventions.

16919887	Pathophysiological model for chronic low back pain integrating connective tissue and nervous system mechanisms.	Although chronic low back pain (cLBP) is increasingly recognized as a complex syndrome with multifactorial etiology, the pathogenic mechanisms leading to the development of chronic pain in this condition remain poorly understood. This article presents a new, testable pathophysiological model integrating connective tissue plasticity mechanisms with several well-developed areas of research on cLBP (pain psychology, postural control, neuroplasticity). We hypothesize that pain-related fear leads to a cycle of decreased movement, connective tissue remodeling, inflammation, nervous system sensitization and further decreased mobility. In addition to providing a new, testable framework for future mechanistic studies of cLBP, the integration of connective tissue and nervous system plasticity into the model will potentially illuminate the mechanisms of a variety of treatments that may reverse these abnormalities by applying mechanical forces to soft tissues (e.g. physical therapy, massage, chiropractic manipulation, acupuncture), by changing specific movement patterns (e.g. movement therapies, yoga) or more generally by increasing activity levels (e.g. recreational exercise). Non-invasive measures of connective tissue remodeling may eventually become important tools to evaluate and follow patients with cLBP in research and clinical practice. An integrative mechanistic model incorporating behavioral and structural aspects of cLBP will strengthen the rationale for a multidisciplinary treatment approach including direct mechanical tissue stimulation, movement reeducation, psychosocial intervention and pharmacological treatment to address this common and debilitating condition.

16911812	Lateral impact injuries with side airbag deployments--a descriptive study.	The present study was designed to provide descriptive data on side impact injuries in vehicles equipped with side airbags using the United States National Automotive Sampling System (NASS). The database was queried with the constraint that all vehicles must adhere to the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards FMVSS 214, injured occupants be in the front outboard seats with no rollovers or ejections, and side impacts airbags be deployed in lateral crashes. Out of the 7812 crashes in the 1997-2004 weighted NASS files, AIS > or = 2 level injuries occurred to 5071 occupants. There were 3828 cases of torso-only airbags, 955 cases of torso-head bag combination, and 288 inflatable tubular structure/curtain systems. Side airbags were not attributed to be the cause of head or chest injury to any occupant at this level of severity. The predominance of torso-only airbags followed by torso-head airbag combination reflected vehicle model years and changing technology. Head and chest injuries were coupled for the vast majority of occupants with injuries to more than one body region. Comparing literature data for side impacts without side airbag deployments, the presence of a side airbag decreased AIS=2 head, chest, and extremity injuries when examining raw data incidence rates. Although this is the first study to adopt strict inclusion-exclusion criteria for side crashes with side airbag deployments, future studies are needed to assess side airbag efficacy using datasets such as matched-pair occupants in side impacts.

16898580	The role of complementary and alternative medicine in diabetes.	Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) describes a diverse group of medical and health care systems, practices, and products not currently considered to be part of conventional medicine. Inadequacies in current treatments for diabetes have led 2 to 3.6 million Americans to use CAM for diabetes treatment, despite limited studies of safety and efficacy of CAM methods. CAM is used mostly by West Indians, Africans, Indians, Latin Americans, or Asians. Prayer, acupuncture, massage, hot tub therapy, biofeedback, and yoga have been used as well as various plant remedies for treating diabetes. Several CAM practices and herbal remedies are promising for diabetes treatment, but further rigorous study is needed in order to establish safety, efficacy, and mechanism of action. In the meantime, it is important to be aware that many patients with diabetes may be using CAM and to consider potential interactions with conventional medicines being used.

16873079	[Psychological stress in oncology: the role of glucocorticoids].	During the last years, the correlations between biological processes, psychological adjustment and stress disorders have received increasing attention and a growing body of research results has been published in the general literature. In the realm of psycho-oncology, however, conceptual models on this topic and studies aimed at their validation have remained relatively scanty. On the basis of our observations and available literature in the field of post-traumatic and depressive stress disorders in oncology, we have proposed to apply the concept of allostatic load to the study and understanding of the psychological experience of cancer. This strategy has led us to the formulation of a novel classification of adjustment disorders in oncology and the creation of the clinical entity named "cancer-specific stress syndrome". Depending on clinical presentation of the syndrome, one distinguishes three subtypes, namely the depressive, post-traumatic and "dysallostatic" (mixed) forms. In the present paper, we examine the role of glucocorticoids and their relationships with one of the basic components of allostatic load--a failure to counter-regulate the immune system by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis--in the physiopathology of stress disorders in oncology. Conflicting theories are presented--glucocorticoid cascade versus insufficient glucocorticoid signal transmission--and studies measuring potential correlations between stress and cortisol in oncology are critically reviewed. The results of this process provide substantial support for the application of the allostatic load model and post-traumatic phenomenology, but important advances have yet to be achieved before definitive conclusions can be established in this field. Such advances could lead to profound changes in the way we understand and treat psychological distress in patients with cancer, both pharmacologically and psychotherapeutically.

16865063	Effects of a yoga lifestyle intervention on performance-related characteristics of musicians: a preliminary study.	BACKGROUND: Previous research has suggested that yoga and meditation practices are effective in stress management, alleviating anxiety and musculoskeletal problems and improving mood and cognitive and physical performance. Musicians experience a number of challenges in their profession including high levels of stress, performance anxiety and performance-related musculoskeletal conditions. Yoga and meditation techniques are therefore potentially useful practices for professional musicians. MATERIAL/METHODS: Musicians enrolled in a prestigious 2-month summer fellowship program were invited to participate in a regular yoga and meditation program at a yoga center during the course of the program. The 10 participants in the yoga program completed baseline and end-program questionnaires evaluating performance-related musculoskeletal conditions, performance anxiety, mood and flow experience. Fellows not participating in the yoga program were recruited to serve as controls and completed the same assessments (N=8). RESULTS: The yoga participants showed some improvements relative to control subjects on most measures, with the relative improvement in performance anxiety being the greatest. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this preliminary study suggest that yoga and meditation may be beneficial as a routine practice to reduce performance anxiety in musicians.

16858219	Aftereffects of exercise and relaxation on blood pressure.	OBJECTIVE: To study the acute aftereffects of exercise and relaxation, performed alone and in combination, on blood pressure (BP) measured at baseline and during stressful conditions. DESIGN: Clinical trial with comparison of groups and repeated measures in each group. SETTING: Exercise Hemodynamic Laboratory, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen normotensive (NT) and 16 essential hypertensive (HT) subjects. INTERVENTIONS: Four random experimental sessions: relaxation (RX-20 min); exercise [EX-cycle ergometer, 53 min, 50% peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak)]; exercise plus relaxation (EX+RX); and control (C-73 min rest). Measures were taken before and after interventions at baseline and during Stroop color test. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Auscultatory and plesthysmographic BPs. RESULTS: Systolic and diastolic BPs decreased significantly after all the interventions. The decreases in both BPs were significantly greater after the EX+RX session, and were also greater in the HT (EX+RX session, -10+/-1/-7+/-1 and -15+/-2/-8+/-1 mm Hg for the NT and HT, respectively). During mental stress, systolic BP increased significantly and similarly after all the experimental sessions. Diastolic BP also increased significantly during stress; however, the increase was significantly greater after the RX session. At the end of the mental stress, diastolic BP was significantly lower after the EX (74+/-3 mm Hg) and EX+RX (72+/-3 mm Hg) sessions than after the C (79+/-3 mm Hg) and RX (78+/-3 mm Hg) sessions. CONCLUSIONS: In NT and HT subjects, a single bout of exercise or relaxation has hypotensive effects, further enhanced by their combination, and greater in the HT. Moreover, exercise performed alone or in combination with relaxation decreases systolic and diastolic BPs during mental stress.

16856055	Exercise in prevention and treatment of anxiety and depression among children and young people.	BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are common psychological disorders for children and adolescents. Psychological (e.g. psychotherapy), psychosocial (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy) and biological (e.g. SSRIs or tricyclic drugs) treatments are the most common treatments being offered. The large variety of therapeutic interventions give rise to questions of clinical effectiveness and side effects. Physical exercise is inexpensive with few, if any, side effects. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of exercise interventions in reducing or preventing anxiety or depression in children and young people up to 20 years of age. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (latest issue available), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC and Sportdiscus up to August 2005. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials of vigorous exercise interventions for children and young people up to the age of 20, with outcome measures for depression and anxiety. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed methodological quality and extracted data. The trials were combined using meta-analysis methods. A narrative synthesis was performed when the reported data did not allow statistical pooling. MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen studies with a total of 1191 participants between 11 and 19 years of age were included.Eleven trials compared vigourous exercise versus no intervention in a general population of children. Six studies reporting anxiety scores showed a non-significant trend in favour of the exercise group (standard mean difference (SMD) (random effects model) -0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.97 to 0.01). Five studies reporting depression scores showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the exercise group (SMD (random effects model) -0.66, 95% CI -1.25 to -0.08). However, all trials were generally of low methodological quality and they were highly heterogeneous with regard to the population, intervention and measurement instruments used. One small trial investigated children in treatment showed no statistically significant difference in depression scores in favour of the control group (SMD (fixed effects model) 0.78, 95% CI -0.47 to 2.04). No studies reported anxiety scores for children in treatment. Five trials comparing vigorous exercise to low intensity exercise show no statistically significant difference in depression and anxiety scores in the general population of children. Three trials reported anxiety scores (SMD (fixed effects model) -0.14, 95% CI -0.41 to 0.13). Two trials reported depression scores (SMD (fixed effects model) -0.15, 95% CI -0.44 to 0.14). Two small trials found no difference in depression scores for children in treatment (SMD (fixed effects model) -0.31, 95% CI -0.78 to 0.16). No studies reported anxiety scores for children in treatment. Four trials comparing exercise with psychosocial interventions showed no statistically significant difference in depression and anxiety scores in the general population of children. Two trials reported anxiety scores (SMD (fixed effects model) -0.13, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.17). Two trials reported depression scores (SMD (fixed effects model) 0.10, 95% CI-0.21 to 0.41). One trial found no difference in depression scores for children in treatment (SMD (fixed effects model) -0.31, 95% CI -0.97 to 0.35). No studies reported anxiety scores for children in treatment. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Whilst there appears to be a small effect in favour of exercise in reducing depression and anxiety scores in the general population of children and adolescents, the small number of studies included and the clinical diversity of participants, interventions and methods of measurement limit the ability to draw conclusions. It makes little difference whether the exercise is of high or low intensity. The effect of exercise for children in treatment for anxiety and depression is unknown as the evidence base is scarce.

16850902	Effect of yoga based lifestyle intervention on state and trait anxiety.	Considerable evidence exists for the place of mind body medicine in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Excessive anxiety is maladaptive. It is often considered to be the major component of unhealthy lifestyle that contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of not only psychiatric but also many other systemic disorders. Among the approaches to reduce the level of anxiety has been the search for healthy lifestyles. The aim of the study was to study the short-term impact of a comprehensive but brief lifestyle intervention, based on yoga, on anxiety levels in normal and diseased subjects. The study was the result of operational research carried out in the Integral Health Clinic (IHC) at the Department of Physiology of All India Institute of Medical Sciences. The subjects had history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity, psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety, 'stress'), gastrointestinal problems (non ulcer dyspepsia, duodenal ulcers, irritable bowel disease, Crohn's disease, chronic constipation) and thyroid disorders (hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism). The intervention consisted of asanas, pranayama, relaxation techniques, group support, individualized advice, and lectures and films on philosophy of yoga, the place of yoga in daily life, meditation, stress management, nutrition, and knowledge about the illness. The outcome measures were anxiety scores, taken on the first and last day of the course. Anxiety scores, both state and trait anxiety were significantly reduced. Among the diseased subjects significant improvement was seen in the anxiety levels of patients of hypertension, coronary artery disease, obesity, cervical spondylitis and those with psychiatric disorders. The observations suggest that a short educational programme for lifestyle modification and stress management leads to remarkable reduction in the anxiety scores within a period of 10 days.

To evaluate the potential effects of medications with central nervous system (CNS) activity on cognitive function and fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS), we performed a retrospective analysis of medication use among 70 subjects with MS who were participating in a clinical trial for evaluation of the effects of yoga and exercise programs on cognition and fatigue. Among these MS subjects, 74% were taking at least one potentially CNS-active medication. These 70 subjects were divided into two groups: those taking at least one CNS-active medication (n = 52) and those not on any medications with potential CNS activity (n = 18). We compared assessments of cognitive function and fatigue using an analysis of covariance. MS subjects on CNS-active medication had greater impairment on measures of processing speed, sustained attention, and fatigue than those not on these medications. While these findings do not establish a causal relationship between medication use and cognitive impairment and fatigue, the data indicate that researchers need to control for use of CNS-active medications when conducting studies of cognitive impairment and fatigue in MS subjects.

16846818	A contemplative care approach to training and supporting hospice volunteers: a prospective study of spiritual practice, well-being, and fear of death.	BACKGROUND: Inspired by a 2,500-year-old Buddhist tradition, the Zen Hospice Project (ZHP) provides residential hospice care, volunteer programs, and educational efforts that cultivate wisdom and compassion in service. OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to understand how being with dying hospice residents affects hospice volunteers well-being and the role of spiritual practice in ameliorating the fear of death. DESIGN: A one-year longitudinal study of two volunteer cohorts (N = 24 and N = 22) with repeated measures of spiritual practice, well-being, and hospice performance during one-year service as volunteers. SETTING: The Zen Hospice Guest House and Laguna Honda Residential Hospital of San Francisco, CA. PARTICIPANTS: All 46 individuals who became ZHP volunteers during two years. INTERVENTIONS: A 40-hour training program for beginning hospice volunteers stressing compassion, equanimity, mindfulness, and practical bedside care; a one-year caregiver assignment five hours per week; and monthly group meeting. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-report FACIT spiritual well-being, general well-being, self-transcendence scale, and a volunteer coordinator-rated ZHP performance scale. RESULTS: The volunteers had a high level of self-care and well-being at baseline and maintained both throughout the year; they increased compassion and decreased fear of death. Those (n = 20) practicing yoga were found to have consistently lower fear of death than the group average (P = .04, P = .008, respectively). All rated the training and program highly, and 63% continued to volunteer after the first year's commitment. The results suggest that this approach to training and supporting hospice volunteers fosters emotional well-being and spiritual growth.

16838123	Oxygen consumption and respiration during and after two yoga relaxation techniques.	Cyclic meditation (CM) is a technique which combines "stimulating" and "calming" practices, based on a statement in ancient yoga texts suggesting that such a combination may be especially helpful to reach a state of mental equilibrium. The oxygen consumption, breath rate and breath volume of 50 male volunteers (group mean age+/-SD, 27+/-6.3 years) were assessed before, during, and after sessions of CM and sessions of supine rest in the corpse posture (shavasana, SH). The sessions were one day apart and the order was alternated. The oxygen consumption, breath rate and breath volume increased during the "stimulating" practices of CM, returned to the baseline during the "calming" practices, and the oxygen consumption decreased by 19.3 percent below baseline values after CM. During the SH session the oxygen consumption, breath rate and breath volume reduced; however the decrease in oxygen consumption after SH was less than after CM (i.e., 4.8 percent). The results support the idea that a combination of yoga postures with supine rest (in CM) reduces the oxygen consumption more than resting supine alone does.	Sarang, Patil S;Telles, Shirley	2006 Jun
16822357	Use of complementary and alternative medicine in epilepsy.	Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has become much in vogue, and CAM practitioners have increased in tandem with this. The trend of using CAM for treating epilepsy does not differ from that in other medical conditions, with nearly one half of patients using CAM. In this article we review the major complementary and alternative medicines used for treatment of epilepsy. They include mind-body medicines such as reiki and yoga; biologic-based medicine such as herbal remedies, dietary supplements, and homeopathy; and manipulative-based medicine such as chiropractic. In the available literature, there is a sense of the merit of these therapies in epilepsy, but there is a paucity of research in these areas. Individualized therapies such as homeopathy and reiki cannot be compared with medicines in a conventional pharmaceutical model. Hence, many studies are inconclusive. In a science of double-blind, randomized controlled trials, appropriate designs and outcome measurements need to be tailored to CAM. This article explains the principles of the major CAM therapies in epilepsy, and discusses peer-reviewed literature where available. More effort needs to be put into future trials, with the assistance of qualified CAM professionals to ensure conformation to their therapeutic principles.	Ricotti, Valeria;Delanty, Norman	2006 Jul
16821087	Correlates of use of different types of complementary and alternative medicine by breast cancer survivors in the nurses' health study.	PURPOSE: Among breast cancer survivors, we identified the prevalence and correlates of use of different types of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 2,022 women diagnosed with breast cancer 1998-2003 who responded to a survey about CAM use. We performed logistic regression to determine demographic and disease factors associated with use of different CAM therapies (including relaxation/imagery, spiritual healing, yoga, energy healing, acupuncture, massage, chiropractic, high-dose vitamins, herbs, and homeopathy). We also measured quality of life (QoL) using the SF36 and optimism using LOT-R and fit linear regression models to compare mean scores among CAM users and nonusers. RESULTS: Sixty-two percent of respondents used CAM. Younger age was the most consistent correlate of CAM use, but factors associated with CAM use varied by type of CAM. Chemotherapy was associated with use of relaxation/imagery (OR 1.3 95%CI 1.1-1.7). Radiotherapy was associated with use of high-dose vitamins (OR 1.5 95% CI 1.2-2.0). Tamoxifen or anastrozole treatment was associated with use of homeopathy (OR 0.5 95%CI 0.3-0.9). Users of most types of CAM had worse QoL scores than nonusers, but better QoL was found among users of yoga. The lowest QoL scores were associated with the use of energy healing. Optimism was higher among users of relaxation/imagery. CONCLUSIONS: Factors associated with CAM use varied according to type of CAM. Our finding of worse QoL among women using energy healing and better QoL among women using yoga suggests the need for longitudinal studies to determine the temporal relationships between these therapies and QoL.

16817607	Reliability of respiratory tidal volume estimation by means of ambulatory inductive plethysmography.	Ambulatory monitoring of ventilatory parameters in everyday life, field research and clinical situations may offer new insights into respiratory functioning in health and disease. Recent technological advances that employ ambulatory inductive plethysmography could make monitoring of respiration outside the clinic and laboratory feasible. Inductive plethysmography provides a method for nonintrusive assessment of both timing (e.g. respiration rate) and volumetric parameters (e.g. tidal volume and minute ventilation), by which tidal volume is initially calibrated to direct measures of volume. Estimates of tidal volume assessed by this technique have been validated in laboratory investigations, usually examining within-individual relations to direct measures over a large range of tidal volume variation. However, the reliability of individual differences in tidal volume or other breathing parameters has not been tested under naturalistic measurement conditions using inductive plethysmography. We examined the test-retest reliability of respiration rate, tidal volume and other volumetric parameters of breathing over a period of six weeks of repeated measurements during baseline conditions and breathing exercises with 16 healthy freely moving volunteers in a Yoga course. Reliability of measurement was evaluated by calculating the average week-to-week between-subject correlation coefficients for each physiological measure. Additionally because body-mass index has been previously positively correlated to tidal volume, we also assessed this relationship as an external criterion of validity of tidal volume estimation. Regarding the latter, similar correlations to those previous studies were found (r = 0.6). Furthermore, reliability estimates were high and consistent across respiratory measures (typically r's = 0.7-0.8). These results suggest the validity of ambulatory inductive plethysmographic measurement of respiration, at least under relatively sedentary conditions. Findings also point to the stability of individual differences in respiratory parameters over consecutive weeks.	Grossman, Paul;Spoerle, Monika;Wilhelm, Frank H	2006
16813509	Complementary and alternative medicine therapies in acne, psoriasis, and atopic eczema: results of a qualitative study of patients' experiences and perceptions.	OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies in patients with acne, psoriasis, or atopic eczema and the attitudes about CAM of these patients. DESIGN: This was a qualitative study, utilizing semistructured interviews and thematic analysis. SETTING: Patients were recruited from the practices of dermatologists and general practitioners in a noncapital Australian city. RESULTS: Twenty-six (26) interviews were conducted with patients with acne, 29 with psoriasis, and 7 with atopic eczema. Use of CAM therapies was common. Participants tended to value CAM over orthodox therapies because of their preference for natural approaches to their skin diseases and the perceived lesser potential for adverse effects of CAM therapies. Respondents with acne were more confident about the efficacy of CAM than were those with psoriasis or eczema. The resulting sense of control attenuated psychologic sequelae of acne. This was not apparent in psoriasis or eczema. CONCLUSIONS: Practitioners should be cognizant of the likely use of CAM and its implications (including the potential for attenuation of psychologic morbidity) in their patients who have skin diseases.

16806478	Intraocular pressure changes and ocular biometry during Sirsasana (headstand posture) in yoga practitioners.	PURPOSE: To study the intraocular pressure (IOP) changes in Sirsasana (headstand posture) done by experienced yoga practitioners and correlate the ocular biometric parameters with the IOP changes, and to screen for the prevalence of ocular hypertension in this group of subjects. DESIGN: Prospective case observational series. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-five subjects (50 Asian Indians and 25 Caucasians) from a yoga training institute volunteered for the study. METHODS: All participants underwent a detailed ophthalmic examination along with ocular biometry and corneal pachymetry. Intraocular pressure was recorded using a Tonopen before, during, and after the Sirsasana. Changes were compared using the paired t test. Age, axial length, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, corneal curvature, corneal thickness, race, and the length of time for which the practitioner was performing yoga were correlated with the induced IOP difference in a randomly selected eye using Pearson's correlation coefficient with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ocular biometry and induced IOP difference. RESULTS: The mean increase in IOP at baseline and immediately after assuming Sirsasana was 15.1+/-4.1 mmHg (R = 0.07; P = 0.999) and after 5 minutes was 15.8+/-4.6 mmHg (R = -0.25; P = 0.357). The induced increase in IOP during the posture was twice the baseline IOP. There was no correlation between age, ocular biometry, and ultrasound pachymetry when compared with the induced IOP difference. One subject (1.33%) was found to have baseline IOP of more than 21 mmHg. CONCLUSION: There was a uniform 2-fold increase in the IOP during Sirsasana, which was maintained during the posture in all age groups irrespective of the ocular biometry and ultrasound pachymetry. We did not demonstrate a higher prevalence of ocular hypertensives in this cohort of yoga practitioners nor did the risk factors contributing to glaucoma show any correlation with magnitude of IOP raise during the posture.

16803930	Promoting healthy lifestyles in children: a pilot program of be a fit kid.	Be a Fit Kid is a 12-week program aimed at improving physical activity and nutritional habits in children. The physical activity component of the program emphasized cardiovascular fitness, flexibility, muscular strength, and bone development through running, yoga, jumping, and strength exercises. All activities were individualized and noncompetitive. The nutrition component focused on current dietary guidelines that emphasize a diet rich in vegetables, fruits, unsaturated fats, and whole grains, and low in saturated fat and sugar. Following the 12-week intervention, significant improvements were observed in body composition, fitness, nutrition knowledge, dietary habits, and in those who participated 75% of the time, significant reductions in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were observed. Findings from the pilot trial suggest that health promotion programs can be well received by children and may favorably alter overweight and the development of adult lifestyle-related diseases.

16781528	Does religious activity improve health outcomes? A critical review of the recent literature.	OBJECTIVE: Many Americans use religious activity to cope with stressful life events. Our goal was to review systematically the recent medical literature to assess the role of religion in health outcomes. DATA SOURCES: We conducted a comprehensive literature search using MEDLINE to identify studies published in the English language between January 1999 and June 2003 describing the effect of religion on health outcomes. The search strategy used the medical subject headings (MeSH) of religion; religion AND medicine; religion OR intercessory prayer; prayer; prayer therapy; religious rites; faith; medicine, traditional; religiosity; religion AND psychology; and religion AND health. STUDY SELECTION: Religious, but not spiritual, interventions were selected for inclusion. Thus, papers describing interventions such as yoga, meditation, acupuncture, and qigong were excluded. Manuscripts describing randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, and partnerships with faith-based organizations were included. DATA EXTRACTION: We found five randomized controlled trials, four clinical trials, and seven faith-based partnerships that describe the impact of religious intervention on health outcomes. Papers were analyzed by four reviewers using a modified Delphi technique to reach consensus. DATA SYNTHESIS: Religious intervention such as intercessory prayer may improve success rates of in vitro fertilization, decrease length of hospital stay and duration of fever in septic patients, increase immune function, improve rheumatoid arthritis, and reduce anxiety. Frequent attendance at religious services likely improves health behaviors. Moreover, prayer may decrease adverse outcomes in patients with cardiac disease. CONCLUSIONS: Religious activity may improve health outcomes.	Coruh, Basak;Ayele, Hana;Pugh, Meredith;Mulligan, Thomas	2005 May

16761690	[Use of complementary and alternative medicine and health problems].	OBJECTIVE: Remarkable growth in use of alternative and complementally medicine (CAM) has recently been noted from consume to trends, detail surveys are limited. In this study, to clarify the actual state of use of CAM and associated problem, we performed a cross sectional study in a town using a self-administrated questionnaire. METHODS: The questionnaire including demographic variables, subjective health status and health practices was addressed by people in Oguni town in Kumamoto. Use of kampo, supplements/healthy food, chiropractic, massage, yoga/meditation, acupuncture, kiko/thai-chi, aromatherapy/herbal medicine and hot springs was assessed in the questionnaire in terms of frequency, prescription or advice from physicians, purpose, and satisfaction. RESULTS: The response rate was 83.33%. Use increased with aging and female employed CAM more frequently than male subjects. Most frequently consumed were supplement/health foods in both females (47.0%) and males (35.3%). The most prescribed was Kampo in both sexes (24.8% and 11.4%) About 70% of the subjects had visited chiropractics therapies. CONCLUSION: From 57.0% of subjects had used at least one CAM in the past six months, a high value compared with results from other countries. The rates were particularly large in female and elderly subjects. It is thus possible that the impact of CAM on health promotion policy is not inconsequential.

16740317	Antidepressant efficacy and hormonal effects of Sudarshana Kriya Yoga (SKY) in alcohol dependent individuals.	BACKGROUND: Sudarshana Kriya Yoga (SKY) has demonstrable antidepressant effects. SKY was tested for this effect in inpatients of alcohol dependence. METHODS: Following a week of detoxification management consenting subjects (n=60) were equally randomized to receive SKY therapy or not (controls) for a two-week study. SKY therapy included alternate day practice of specified breathing exercise under supervision of a trained therapist. Subjects completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) before and after the two weeks of this intervention. Morning plasma cortisol, ACTH and prolactin too were measured before and at the end of two weeks. RESULTS: In both groups reductions in BDI scores occurred but significantly more so in SKY group. Likewise, in both groups plasma cortisol as well as ACTH fell after two weeks but significantly more so in SKY group. Reduction in BDI scores correlated with that in cortisol in SKY but not in control group. LIMITATIONS: Antidepressant effects of SKY were demonstrated in early abstinence that also had substantial spontaneous improvement. It is not known if this effect contributes to sustained abstinence. CONCLUSION: Results extend the antidepressant effects of SKY in alcohol dependence subjects. Reduction in stress-hormone levels (cortisol and ACTH) along with BDI reductions possibly support a biological mechanism of SKY in producing beneficial effects.

16724570	White tail disease of the giant freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii in Thailand.	White tail disease (WTD) of the freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii has recently been the cause of high mortalities in Thai prawn farms. The causative agents of this disease in other countries are M. rosenbergii nodavirus (MrNV) and extra small virus (XSV), which are usually detected using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) protocols. Using RT-PCR, most Thai post-larvae (PL) samples showing gross signs of WTD tested positive for MrNV but only a few were positive for XSV. In contrast, all tested brooder samples were positive for both MrNV and XSV. The possibility that brooders infected with MrNV and XSV could transmit the viruses to larvae and PL should be examined. Cloning, sequencing and comparison of deduced amino acid sequences of RT-PCR amplicons of WTD samples from Thailand with those of MrNV and XSV previously reported from the French West Indies and China revealed that the MrNV were closely related but not identical while those from XSV were identical. This is the first report of MrNV and XSV from Thailand.	Yoganandhan, Kalidoss;Leartvibhas, Manee;Sriwongpuk, Supamas;Limsuwan, Chalor	2006 Apr 6
16722786	A pilot study of a yoga meditation protocol for patients with medically refractory epilepsy.	OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the efficacy of a yoga meditation protocol (YMP) as an adjunctive treatment in patients with drug-resistant chronic epilepsy. DESIGN: The design was a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, add-on trial with a 12-week baseline period, followed by a 12-week supervised YMP administration phase. The frequency of complex partial seizures (CPS) was assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months of the treatment period. SETTING: The setting was a comprehensive epilepsy care center attached to a tertiary referral medical institution situated on the southwest coast of the Indian peninsula. SUBJECTS: The subjects were 20 patients (14 males and 6 females, age range 15 to 47 years, median 27 years) with unequivocally established diagnoses of epilepsy with at least 4 CPS (with or without secondary generalization) during the preceding 3 months. INTERVENTION: Intervention consisted of a YMP 20 minutes twice daily (mornings and evenings) at home, and supervised sessions of a YMP every week for 3 months. Continuation of the YMP beyond 3 months was optional. OUTCOME MEASURE: The outcome measure was the seizure frequency at 3, 6, and 12 months of the treatment period. The subjects with > or = 50% reduction in monthly seizure rate from baseline were classified as responders, and subjects with <50% seizure reduction as nonresponders. RESULTS: At 3 months, a reduction in seizure frequency was noted in all except 1 patient, six of whom had > or = 50% seizure reduction. Of 16 patients who continued the YMP beyond 3 months, 14 patients responded at 6 months; 6 of them were seizure-free for 3 months. All eight patients who continued the YMP beyond 6 months responded; three of them were seizure free for 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: If confirmed through randomized trials involving a larger number of patients, this YMP may become a cost-effective and adverse effect-free adjunctive treatment in patients with drug-resistant epilepsies.

Eighty-eight patients, selected by systematic random sampling in two public polyclinics in April/May 2004, were interviewed. They completed a structured pre-tested questionnaire. Forty-one percent were using CM, majority (64%) together with conventional therapy. Eighty-one percent did not inform their physicians of their CM usage. More Malays were using CM which included nutritional supplements, herbs, yoga, homoeopathy, reflexology and massage.	Mokhtar, N;Chan, S C	2006 Mar
19804086	Review of trials examining the use of acupuncture to treat hypertension.	Although hypertension is a major risk factor for heart attack and stroke in the US, only approximately a quarter of adults receive adequate hypertension treatment and control their blood pressure (BP) effectively. There are disparities in the prevalence of hypertension, its treatment and control with respect to age, sex, racial groups and education. The seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of high BP (JNC 7 report) provides lifestyle modification with and without pharmacological intervention recommendations for preventing and treating different stages of hypertension. Recently, nonpharmacological approaches including yoga, meditation, acupressure and acupuncture have been considered as potential therapeutic options. Acupuncture has been used empirically for nearly 3000 years to treat a variety of diseases, including cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension, hypotension, coronary disease and certain arrhythmias. Previous studies suggest that short and chronic elevation in BP can be lowered in animal models and human subjects. However, the mechanisms underlying the antihypertensive effects of acupuncture are not yet fully understood. An increasing interest in acupuncture healthcare has led to a growing number of investigators to pursue research in this field. This article briefly summarizes available studies, including our own reports, that demonstrate evidence for acupuncture modulation of cardiovascular function, particularly BP reduction, and concludes that future treatment of hypertension can potentially include acupuncture as a nonpharmacological intervention.

16635436	Complementary and alternative medicine: is there a role in multiple sclerosis?	Despite effective conventional therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS), many people with MS explore complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies for their symptoms. Common CAM therapies that people use include dietary modification, nutritional and herbal supplementation, and mind-body therapies. There is a revival of interest among MS researchers about the therapeutic potential of low-fat diet and essential fatty acid supplementation in MS. The efficacy of specific vitamin supplementation remains unclear. Recently, cannabis and yoga have been studied in more controlled studies and have provided evidence that they may have some benefit. The research on CAM therapies in MS is still exploratory, but considering peoples' interest and common use of these therapies, further research in this area is clearly warranted.

16622630	[On the stability and modifiability of the sense of coherence in active seniors].	According to Antonovsky, the sense of coherence (SOC) determines health and wellbeing. This life orientation is shaped up to the age of 30 and is supposed to remain constant up to senior age. In a field study, in which the SOC, psycho-social resources and subjective health were assessed at three points in time, it could be shown for the first time that the SOC in old age can be malleable and expanding. The master sample (time t(1)) consisted of N = 58 active and "healthy" seniors at the mean age of 66.3 years (65.5% female), who decided to take part in a 14-week program focusing on physical activity and/or self-reflection (endurance training, strength training, yoga, or meditation), respectively. One year before, 90% of them had participated in the Greifswald Aging Study (t0). The intervention study was attended regularly by n = 42 persons (t1 and t2). The SOC and associated health appraisals remained constant over a period of one year (t0-t1); re-test reliabilities varied from satisfactory to very good. Overall, the current SOC (t1) was more important than the past SOC (t0) in accounting for current well-being (t1). The intervention (t1-t2) revealed that the elderly's SOC was significantly strengthened-independently of the program they took part in. Correspondingly, participants' wellbeing, subjective health and psycho-social resources were enhanced. Taking part in a systematic, age-based and group-oriented program that encourages an active and productive every-day life brings about coherence-promoting and health-promoting life experiences in old age.

16609726	Yoga and the battlefield of ethics: highlighting an infusion model for ethics education.	This paper articulates an infusion model of ethics education for engineering students by illuminating the value of a religious studies course on yoga. This model is distinguished from four other possible approaches that have traditionally been used to prepare engineering students to face the challenges of the work place. The article is not claiming that this approach should be used to the exclusion of the other approaches, but rather that it adds strength to the other approaches. Specifically, the article claims that the infusion model provides an opportunity for students to reflect upon the foundational ethical positions emanating from the world's religions and thereby provides them with a vista from which they can not only ask what professional ethical code applies in a given situation, but also ponder the nature of character needed to follow that ethical code.

16580272	Trabecular bone density of male human cervical and lumbar vertebrae.	The objective of this study was to determine the bone mineral density (BMD) of cervical vertebrae and correlate with the lumbar spine. Fifty-seven young adult healthy male volunteers, ranging from 18 to 41 years of age, underwent quantitative computed tomography (QCT) scanning of C2-T1 and L2-L4 vertebrae. To account for correlations, repeated measures techniques were used to compare data as a function of spinal level and region. Linear regression methods were used (+/-95% CI) to compare data as a function of spinal level and region. The mean age and body height were 25.0 +/- 5.8 years and 181.0 +/- 7.6 cm. BMD decreased from the rostral to caudal direction along the spinal column. Grouped data indicated that the neck is the densest followed by the first thoracic vertebra and low back with mean BMD of 256.0 +/- 48.1, 194.3 +/- 44.2, and 172.2 +/- 28.4 mg/cm(3), respectively; differences were statistically significant. While BMD did not vary significantly between the three lumbar bodies, neck vertebrae demonstrated significant trends. The matrix of correlation coefficients between BMD and spinal level indicated that the relationship is strong in the lumbar (r = 0.92-0.96) and cervical (r = 0.73-0.92) spines. Data from the present study show that the trabecular bony architecture of the neck is significantly different from the low back. These quantitative BMD data from a controlled young adult healthy human male volunteer population may be valuable in establishing normative data specifically for the neck. From a trabecular bone density perspective, these results indicate that lumbar vertebrae cannot act as the best surrogates for neck vertebrae. Significant variations in densities among neck vertebrae, unlike the low back counterpart, may underscore the need to treat these bones as different structures.

16579401	Effect of Sahaj Yoga on depressive disorders.	Sahaj Yoga is a meditative technique that has been found to have beneficial effects in some psycho-somatic illnesses. The study was carried out on 30 cases (19 Males, 11 females, age 18-45 years) of major depression diagnosed on the basis of DSM IV criteria. The patients were then randomly divided into two groups: Group 1: (10 Males & 5 Females) Patients who were practising Sahaj Yoga and also received conventional anti-depressants. Group 2: (9 Males & 6 Females) Patients who were only receiving conventional anti-depressants. Training in Sahaj yoga was conducted under the supervision of a trained Sahaj Yogi for 8 weeks. At start of the study, all the patients were subjected to Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A). Above scales were again assessed after two months of treatment. There was significant improvement in HAM-D as well as HAM-A scores in both Group 1 and Group 2 patients (P<0.001). However, percentage improvement in HAM-D scores and HAM-A scores in patients receiving Sahaj Yoga was significantly higher than in Group 2 patients. The number of patients who went into remission after two months of intervention were also significantly higher in Group 1 patients (P=0.02). The present study demonstrates that Sahaj Yoga has got a potential role as a component in the management of depressive disorders.	Sharma, V K;Das, S;Mondal, S;Goswampi, U;Gandhi, A	2005 Oct-Dec

16527285	Biomechanics of side impact: injury criteria, aging occupants, and airbag technology.	This paper presents a survey of side impact trauma-related biomedical investigations with specific reference to certain aspects of epidemiology relating to the growing elderly population, improvements in technology such as side airbags geared toward occupant safety, and development of injury criteria. The first part is devoted to the involvement of the elderly by identifying variables contributing to injury including impact severity, human factors, and national and international field data. This is followed by a survey of various experimental models used in the development of injury criteria and tolerance limits. The effects of fragility of the elderly coupled with physiological changes (e.g., visual, musculoskeletal) that may lead to an abnormal seating position (termed out-of-position) especially for the driving population are discussed. Fundamental biomechanical parameters such as thoracic, abdominal and pelvic forces; upper and lower spinal and sacrum accelerations; and upper, middle and lower chest deflections under various initial impacting conditions are evaluated. Secondary variables such as the thoracic trauma index and pelvic acceleration (currently adopted in the United States Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards), peak chest deflection, and viscous criteria are also included in the survey. The importance of performing research studies with specific focus on out-of-position scenarios of the elderly and using the most commonly available torso side airbag as the initial contacting condition in lateral impacts for occupant injury assessment is emphasized.

16519085	The beneficial effect of yoga in diabetes.	Twenty NIDDM subjects (mild to moderate diabetics) in the age group of 30-60 years were selected from the out patient clinic of G.T.B. hospital. They were on a 40 days yoga asana regime under the supervision of a yoga expert. 13 specific Yoga asanas < or = done by Type 2 Diabetes Patients included. Surya Namaskar, Trikonasana, Tadasana, Sukhasana, Padmasana, Bhastrika Pranayama, Pashimottanasana, Ardhmatsyendrasana, Pawanmuktasana, Bhujangasana, Vajrasana, Dhanurasana and Shavasana are beneficial for diabetes mellitus. Serum insulin, plasma fasting and one hour postprandial blood glucose levels and anthropometric parameters were measured before and after yoga asanas. The results indicate that there was significant decrease in fasting glucose levels from basal 208.3 +/- 20.0 to 171.7 +/- 19.5 mg/dl and one hour postprandial blood glucose levels decreased from 295.3 +/- 22.0 to 269.7 +/- 19.9 mg/dl. The exact mechanism as to how these postures and controlled breathing interact with somatoendocrine mechanism affecting insulin kinetics was worked out. A significant decrease in waist-hip ratio and changes in insulin levels were also observed, suggesting a positive effect of yoga asanas on glucose utilisation and fat redistribution in NIDDM. Yoga asanas may be used as an adjunct with diet and drugs in the management of Type 2 diabetes.	Malhotra, Varun;Singh, Savita;Tandon, Om Prakash;Sharma, Suman Bala	2005 Dec

16500773	Stress management: a randomized study of cognitive behavioural therapy and yoga.	In this study, a stress management program based on cognitive behavioural therapy principles was compared with a Kundaliniyoga program. A study sample of 26 women and 7 men from a large Swedish company were divided randomly into 2 groups for each of the different forms of intervention; a total of 4 groups. The groups were instructed by trained group leaders and 10 sessions were held with each of groups, over a period of 4 months. Psychological (self-rated stress and stress behaviour, anger, exhaustion, quality of life) and physiological (blood pressure, heart rate, urinary catecholamines, salivary cortisol) measurements obtained before and after treatment showed significant improvements on most of the variables in both groups as well as medium-to-high effect sizes. However, no significant difference was found between the 2 programs. The results indicate that both cognitive behaviour therapy and yoga are promising stress management techniques.

16485612	[The effectiveness of body-oriented methods of therapy in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): results of a controlled pilot study].	OBJECTIVES: Randomized controlled studies on the effectiveness of body-oriented methods of treatment for children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are lacking. Our aim was to compare the effectiveness of two methods of treatment (yoga for children vs. conventional motor exercises) in a randomized controlled pilot study. METHODS: Nineteen children with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD (according to ICD-10 criteria) were included and randomly assigned to treatment conditions according to a 2x2 cross-over design. Effects of treatment were analyzed by means of an analysis of variance for repeated measurements. RESULTS: For all outcome measures (test scores on an attention task, and parent ratings of ADHD symptoms) the yoga training was superior to the conventional motor training, with effect sizes in the medium-to-high range (0.60-0.97). All children showed sizable reductions in symptoms over time, and at the end of the study, the group means for the ADHD scales did not differ significantly from those for a representative control group. Furthermore, the training was particularly effective for children undergoing pharmacotherapy (MPH). CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this pilot study demonstrate that yoga can be an effective complementary or concomitant treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. The study advocates further research into the impact of yoga or body-oriented therapies on the prevention and treatment of ADHD.

16471112	Usage of and cost of complementary/alternative medicine in diabetic patients.	The purposes of the present survey research in diabetic patients were 1) to determine characteristics of complementary/alternative medicine (CAM) use, 2) to identify factors related to CAM use such as sociodemographic, adverse effects, and quality of life, and 3) to determine differences between patients who used and did not use CAM. The data was collected through developed questionnaires and SF-36 scale Thai version. Samples were 159 diabetes patients over 18 years of age or older who came for treatment at Suppasitthiprasong Hospital, Ubon Ratchathani Province, Thailand. The results indicated that the prevalence of CAM use was rather high (47.8%). The most common types of CAM used were yoga/exercise (32.8%), unchanged form of herbal medicine (29.9%), and changed form herbal medicine (17.8%). The average expense of CAM use was dollar 8.58 per person per month. Thus, if the percentage of CAM use and the cost were true for other Thai diabetic patients throughout Thailand, CAM use expenditure for the whole country would be about dollar 915,250-1,545,750 per month, which is quite high for a small country like Thailand. Most patients (64.4%) who used CAM did not inform their doctors about their CAM use. Results also indicated that government official patients were more likely to use CAM than those of farmer patients significantly (p-value = 0.03, odds ratio = 12.11). In addition, the present study found that patients who had a higher income were more likely to use CAM than those of lower income patients significantly (p - value = 0.04, odds ratio = 1.01). However, other factors such as age, sex, marital status, level of education, health insurance coverage status, duration of time to treat, occurrence of adverse effects, and quality of life were not different between the patients who used CAM and who did not use CAM. Physicians should pay more attention to the CAM use of patients since they used CAM without informing physicians and some herbal medicines may cause hypoglycemia. However, the study results had some limitations to apply to other Thai populations since the sample were Suppasitthiprasong patients who may be different from other Thai populations in many ways such as their local culture, belief, and CAM use types and cost.

16454146	Randomized, controlled, six-month trial of yoga in healthy seniors: effects on cognition and quality of life.	CONTEXT: There are potential benefits of mind-body techniques on cognitive function because the techniques involve an active attentional or mindfulness component, but this has not been fully explored. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of yoga on cognitive function, fatigue, mood, and quality of life in seniors. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial comparing yoga, exercise, and wait-list control groups. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred thirty-five generally healthy men and women aged 65-85 years. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized to 6 months of Hatha yoga class, walking exercise class, or wait-list control. Subjects assigned to classes also were asked to practice at home. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome assessments performed at baseline and after the 6-month period included a battery of cognitive measures focused on attention and alertness, the primary outcome measures being performance on the Stroop Test and a quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) measure of alertness; SF-36 health-related quality of life; Profile of Mood States; Multi-Dimensional Fatigue Inventory; and physical measures related to the interventions. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-five subjects were recruited and randomized. Seventeen subjects did not finish the 6-month intervention. There were no effects from either of the active interventions on any of the cognitive and alertness outcome measures. The yoga intervention produced improvements in physical measures (eg, timed 1-legged standing, forward flexibility) as well as a number of quality-of-life measures related to sense of well-being and energy and fatigue compared to controls. CONCLUSIONS: There were no relative improvements of cognitive function among healthy seniors in the yoga or exercise group compared to the wait-list control group. Those in the yoga group showed significant improvement in quality-of-life and physical measures compared to exercise and wait-list control groups.

16442919	The role of exercise in modulating the impact of an ultralow-fat diet on serum lipids and apolipoproteins in patients with or at risk for coronary artery disease.	BACKGROUND: Ultralow-fat diets are known to reduce high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. In the setting of a multicomponent lifestyle intervention program, relationships between exercise variables and HDL-C levels were examined to determine whether exercise moderates this dietary effect on serum lipids and apolipoproteins. METHODS: We performed a 3-month, prospective, nonrandomized lifestyle intervention study (< or = 10% dietary fat; aerobic exercise [180 min/wk], group support, and yoga [60 min/day]) in 120 subjects with or at risk for coronary artery disease. RESULTS: After 3 months, dietary fat intake was reduced to 8.7% +/- 2.6% of total intake and the median weekly exercise time was 194 minutes. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased by 8.3 +/- 11.3 mg/dL (P < .001), and triglyceride levels increased by 17.6 +/- 102.7 mg/dL (P = .026). A small dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) phenotype emerged indicated by a 13.8% LDL-C reduction accompanied by only a 2.3% reduction in apolipoprotein B levels (P = .064). Among subjects with exercise amounts less than those of the group median, HDL-C reductions were greater in those with more than (-13.5 +/- 16.0 mg/dL) versus less than (-2.5 +/- 7.5 mg/dL) the median reductions in fat intake (P = .026). Even among subjects who exercised > 194 min/wk, HDL-C was reduced compared with baseline (-7.4 +/- 7.9 mg/dL, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: An ultralow-fat diet as a component of a comprehensive lifestyle intervention induces reductions in HDL-C and the emergence of a dyslipidemic lipid profile. Aerobic exercise only partially mitigates this effect.	Marshall, Debra A;Vernalis, Marina N;Remaley, Alan T;Walizer, Elaine M;Scally, John P;Taylor, Allen J	2006 Feb
16440857	Effect of a comprehensive yoga-based lifestyle modification program on lipid peroxidation.	Oxidative stress contributes to the process of aging as well as a variety of chronic degenerative diseases. There are indications that psychological stress increases oxidative stress whereas relaxation decreases it. We have measured the concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in blood as an indicator of oxidative stress at the beginning and at the end of a comprehensive yoga-based lifestyle modification program (YLMP). The data was collected from 104 subjects (59 male, 45 female), 19-71 years of age (mean +/- SD, 41.2 +/- 14.6 years). The YLMP consisted of a nine-day educational out-patient course on the theory and practice of yoga and included, besides a daily one-hour practice of physical postures (asanas) and breathing exercises (pranayama), lecture and films on yoga, stress management and nutrition, practice of meditation and shavasana (a relaxation technique), and individual counseling. Venous blood samples were collected on the first and last day of the course. The serum concentration of TBARS decreased significantly from 1.72 +/- 0.72 nmoles/ml on day 1 to 1.57 +/- 0.72 nmoles/ml on day 10 (P<0.05). The study suggests that a brief low cost lifestyle intervention based on yoga reduces oxidative stress.	Yadav, Raj Kumar;Ray, Rooma Basu;Vempati, Ramaprabhu;Bijlani, Ramesh Lal	2005 Jul-Sep
16440850	An investigation into the acute and long-term effects of selected yogic postures on fasting and postprandial glycemia and insulinemia in healthy young subjects.	The study was conducted to examine the hypothesis that yogasanas help in the treatment of diabetes mellitus by releasing insulin from the pancreas. Twenty healthy young voluntees (17 male, 3 female; age 19-31 years) participated in the study. Each volunteer performed four sets of asanas in random order for 5 consecutive days each with a 2-day gap between consecutive sets of asanas. The four sets of asanas were: (I) dhanurasana + matsyendrasana, (II) halasana + vajrasana, (III) naukasana + bhujangasana, and (IV) setubandhasana + pavanamuktasana. Blood samples were collected on days 4 and 5 of each set of asanas for measurement of glucose and insulin levels before the asanas, within 10 min after performing the asanas, and 30 min after ingestion of 75 g glucose, which in turn was ingested immediately after the second blood sample. A standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was also done before and after the study. On the days of the pre-study or post-study OGTT, no asanas were done. The serum insulin levels after the asanas were lower (P<0.05) than those before the asanas. However, the serum insulin level 0.5 h after the post-asana oral 75 g-glucose challenge was higher (P<0.05) in Set IV than the 0.5 h postprandial insulin level in the pre-study OGTT; the same trend was observed in other sets as well although statistically not significant. The observations suggest that the performance of asanas led to increased sensitivity of the B cells of pancreas to the glucose signal. The increased sensitivity seems to be a sustained change resulting from a progressive long-term effect of asanas. The study is significant in that it has for the first time attempted to probe the mechanism by which yogasanas help diabetes mellitus.	Manjunatha, S;Vempati, R P;Ghosh, D;Bijlani, R L	2005 Jul-Sep
16440849	Effect of slow and fast pranayams on reaction time and cardiorespiratory variables.	We planned to undertake a comparative study of the effect of short term (three weeks) training in savitri (slow breathing) and bhastrika (fast breathing) pranayams on respiratory pressures and endurance, reaction time, blood pressure, heart rate, rate-pressure product and double product. Thirty student volunteers were divided into two groups of fifteen each. Group I was given training in savitri pranayam that involves slow, rhythmic, and deep breathing. Group II was given training in bhastrika pranayam, which is bellows-type rapid and deep breathing. Parameters were measured before and after three week training period. Savitri pranayam produced a significant increase in respiratory pressures and respiratory endurance. In both the groups, there was an appreciable but statistically insignificant shortening of reaction time. Heart rate, rate-pressure product and double product decreased in savitri pranayam group but increased significantly in bhastrika group. It is concluded that different types of pranayams produce different physiological responses in normal young volunteers.

16437509	Meditation therapy for anxiety disorders.	BACKGROUND: Anxiety disorders are characterised by long term worry, tension, nervousness, fidgeting and symptoms of autonomic system hyperactivity. Meditation is an age-old self regulatory strategy which is gaining more interest in mental health and psychiatry. Meditation can reduce arousal state and may ameliorate anxiety symptoms in various anxiety conditions. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effectiveness of meditation therapy in treating anxiety disorders SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic databases searched include CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References, complementary and alternative medicine specific databases, Science Citation Index, Health Services/Technology Assessment Text database, and grey literature databases. Conference proceedings, book chapters and references were checked. Study authors and experts from religious/spiritual organisations were contacted. SELECTION CRITERIA: Types of studies: Randomised controlled trials. TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: patients with a diagnosis of anxiety disorders, with or without another comorbid psychiatric condition. Types of interventions: concentrative meditation or mindfulness meditation. Comparison conditions: one or combination of 1) pharmacological therapy 2) other psychological treatment 3) other methods of meditation 4) no intervention or waiting list. Types of outcome: 1) improvement in clinical anxiety scale 2) improvement in anxiety level specified by triallists, or global improvement 3) acceptability of treatment, adverse effects 4) dropout. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were independently extracted by two reviewers using a pre-designed data collection form. Any disagreements were discussed with a third reviewer, and the authors of the studies were contacted for further information. MAIN RESULTS: Two randomised controlled studies were eligible for inclusion in the review. Both studies were of moderate quality and used active control comparisons (another type of meditation, relaxation, biofeedback). Anti-anxiety drugs were used as standard treatment. The duration of trials ranged from 3 months (12 weeks) to 18 weeks. In one study transcendental meditation showed a reduction in anxiety symptoms and electromyography score comparable with electromyography-biofeedback and relaxation therapy. Another study compared Kundalini Yoga (KY), with Relaxation/Mindfulness Meditation. The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale showed no statistically significant difference between groups. The overall dropout rate in both studies was high (33-44%). Neither study reported on adverse effects of meditation. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The small number of studies included in this review do not permit any conclusions to be drawn on the effectiveness of meditation therapy for anxiety disorders. Transcendental meditation is comparable with other kinds of relaxation therapies in reducing anxiety, and Kundalini Yoga did not show significant effectiveness in treating obsessive-compulsive disorders compared with Relaxation/Meditation. Drop out rates appear to be high, and adverse effects of meditation have not been reported. More trials are needed.	Krisanaprakornkit, T;Krisanaprakornkit, W;Piyavhatkul, N;Laopaiboon, M	2006 Jan 25
16422138	Evaluating a yogic breathing and meditation intervention for individuals living with HIV/AIDS.	PURPOSE: To assess the effectiveness of a group program aimed at improving well-being among individuals living with HIV/AIDS. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was used to evaluate a residential program designed to teach breathing, movement, and meditation techniques. Sixty-two participants were recruited from community HIV/AIDS organizations. Fifteen withdrawals from the study left 47 study participants. Standardized measures used were the Mental Health Index (MHI), the MOS-HIV Health Survey (MOS), and the Daily Stress Inventory (DSI), along with qualitative interviews. RESULTS: A repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated positive changes in well-being on the MHI and the MOS, where the effect was primarily seen immediately following the program and disappeared at later data points. The DSI indicated an increase in experience and impact of stress over time for the intervention group postprogram. Alternatively, the qualitative interviews described positive changes in how participants were living their day-to-day lives. CONCLUSION: In order to capture the outcomes of this program properly, both qualitative and quantitative measures are needed.	Brazier, Alison;Mulkins, Andrea;Verhoef, Marja	2006 Jan-Feb
16398590	The integration of complementary therapies in Australian general practice: results of a national survey.	METHODS: Australian general practitioners' (GPs) attitudes toward and use of a range of complementary therapies (CTs) were determined through a self-administered postal survey sent to a random sample of 2000 Australian GPs. The survey canvassed GPs' opinions as to the harmfulness and effectiveness of CTs; current levels of training and interest in further training; personal use of, and use in practice of, CTs; referrals to CT; practitioners; appropriateness for GPs to practice and for government regulation; perceived patient demand and the need for undergraduate education. RESULTS: The response rate was 33.2%. Based on GPs' responses, complementary therapies could be classified into: nonmedicinal and nonmanipulative therapies, such as acupuncture, massage, meditation, yoga, and hypnosis, that were seen to be highly effective and safe; medicinal and manipulative therapies, including chiropractic, Chinese herbal medicine, osteopathy, herbal medicine, vitamin and mineral therapy, naturopathy, and homeopathy, which more GPs considered potentially harmful than potentially effective; and esoteric therapies, such as spiritual healing, aromatherapy, and reflexology, which were seen to be relatively safe yet also relatively ineffective. The risks of CTs were seen to mainly arise from incorrect, inadequate, or delayed diagnoses and interactions between complementary medications and pharmaceuticals, rather than the specific risks of the therapies themselves. CONCLUSIONS: Nonmedicinal therapies along with chiropractic are widely accepted in Australia and can be considered mainstream. GPs are open to training in complementary therapies, and better communication between patients and GPs about use of CTs is required to minimize the risk of adverse events. There is also a need to prioritize and provide funding for further research into the potential adverse events from these therapies and other therapies currently lacking an evidence base.

16395180	Bone mineral density of human female cervical and lumbar spines from quantitative computed tomography.	STUDY DESIGN: This study determined bone mineral density (BMD) of cervical, thoracic, and lumbar vertebrae in healthy asymptomatic human subjects. OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that BMD of neck vertebrae (C2-C7) is equivalent to BMD of lumbar vertebrae (L2-L4). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: BMD of lumbar vertebrae is correlated to their strength. Although numerous studies exist quantifying BMD of the human lumbar spine, such information for the cervical spine is extremely limited. In addition, BMD correlations are not established between the two regions of the spinal column. METHODS: Adult healthy human female volunteers with ages ranging from 18 to 40 years underwent quantitative computed tomography (CT) scanning of the neck and back. All BMD data were statistically analyzed using paired nonrepeating measures ANOVA techniques. Significance was assigned at a P < 0.05. Linear regression analyses were used to compare BMD as a function of level and region; +/-95% confidence intervals were determined. RESULTS: When data were grouped by cervical (C2-C7), thoracic (T1), and lumbar (L2-L4) spines, mean BMD was 260.8 +/- 42.5, 206.9 +/- 33.5, and 179.7 +/- 23.4 mg/mL. Average BMD of cervical vertebrae was higher than (P < 0.0001) thoracic and lumbar spines. Correlations between BMD and level indicated the lowest r value for T1 (0.42); in general, the association was the strongest in the lumbar spine (r = 0.89-0.95). The cervical spine also responded with good correlations among cervical vertebrae (r ranging from 0.66 to 0.87). CONCLUSIONS: The present study failed to support the hypothesis that BMD of lumbar spine vertebrae is equivalent to its cranial counterparts. The lack of differences in BMD among the three lumbar vertebral bodies confirms the appropriateness of using L2, L3, or L4 in clinical or biomechanical situations. However, significant differences were found among different regions of the vertebral column, with the cervical spine demonstrating higher trabecular densities than the thoracic and lumbar spines. In addition, the present study found statistically significant variations in densities even among neck vertebrae.

16392435	Complementary/alternative medicine for hypertension: a mini-review.	Many hypertensive patients try complementary/alternative medicine for blood pressure control. Based on extensive electronic literature searches, the evidence from clinical trials is summarised. Numerous herbal remedies, non-herbal remedies and other approaches have been tested and some seem to have antihypertensive effects. The effect size is usually modest, and independent replications are frequently missing. The most encouraging data pertain to garlic, autogenic training, biofeedback and yoga. More research is required before firm recommendations can be offered.	Ernst, Edzard	2005 Sep
16387692	Effect of rhythmic breathing (Sudarshan Kriya and Pranayam) on immune functions and tobacco addiction.	Stress, a psychophysiological process, acts through the immune-neuroendocrine axis and affects cellular processes of body and immune functions, leading to disease states including cancer. Stress is also linked to the habit of tobacco consumption and substance abuse, which in turn also leads to diseases. Sudarshan Kriya (SK) and Pranayam (P), rhythmic breathing processes, are known to reduce stress and improve immune functions. Cancer patients who had completed their standard therapy were studied. SK and P increased natural killer (NK) cells significantly (P <0.001) at 12 and 24 weeks of the practice compared to baseline. Increase in NK cells at 24 weeks was significant (P <0.05) compared to controls. There was no effect on T-cell subsets after SK and P either in the study group or among controls. SK and P helped to control the tobacco habit in 21% of individuals who were followed up to 6 months of practice. We conclude that the inexpensive and easy to learn and practice breathing processes (SK and P) in this study demonstrated an increase in NK cells and a reduction in tobacco consumption. When confirmed in large and randomized studies, this result could mean that the regular practice of SK and P might reduce the incidence and progression of cancer.

16374892	A pilot study of yoga for breast cancer survivors: physical and psychological benefits.	BACKGROUND: Physical activity provides a number of physical and psychological benefits to cancer survivors, including lessening the impact of detrimental cancer-related symptoms and treatment side-effects (e.g. fatigue, nausea), and improving overall well-being and quality of life. The purpose of the present pilot study was to examine the physical and psychological benefits afforded by a 7-week yoga program for cancer survivors. METHOD: Eligible participants (per-screened with PAR-Q/PAR-MED-X) were randomly assigned to either the intervention (n=20) or control group (n=18). All participants completed pre- and post-testing assessments immediately before and after the yoga program, respectively. RESULTS: The yoga program participants (M age=51.18 (10.33); 92% female) included primarily breast cancer survivors, on average 55.95 (54.39) months post-diagnosis. Significant differences between the intervention and the control group at post-intervention were seen only in psychosocial (i.e. global quality of life, emotional function, and diarrhea) variables (all p's <0.05). There were also trends for group differences, in the hypothesized directions, for the psychosocial variables of emotional irritability, gastrointestinal symptoms, cognitive disorganization, mood disturbance, tension, depression, and confusion (all p's <0.10). Finally, there were also significant improvements in both the program participants and the controls from pre- to post-intervention on a number of physical fitness variables. CONCLUSIONS: These initial findings suggest that yoga has significant potential and should be further explored as a beneficial physical activity option for cancer survivors. Future research might attempt to include a broader range of participants (e.g. other types of cancer diagnoses, male subjects), a larger sample size, and a longer program duration in an RCT.

16373889	Association between complementary and alternative medicine use, preventive care practices, and use of conventional medical services among adults with diabetes.	OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use, preventive care practices, and use of conventional medical services among adults with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed data on 2,474 adults with diabetes. We created an overall CAM-use category based on use of any of the following: diets, herbs, chiropractic care, yoga, relaxation, acupuncture, ayuverda, biofeedback, chelation, energy healing, Reiki therapy, hypnosis, massage, naturopathy, and homeopathy. We used multiple logistic regression to assess the effect of CAM use on preventive care practices (receipt of influenza and pneumonia vaccines) and use of conventional medical services (number of primary care and emergency department visits). STATA was used for statistical analysis to account for the complex survey design. RESULTS: A total of 48% of adults with diabetes used some form of CAM. CAM use was independently associated with receipt of pneumonia vaccination (odds ratio 1.56 [95% CI 1.26-1.94]) but not significantly associated with receipt of influenza vaccination (1.17 [0.92-1.48]). CAM use was independently associated with visiting the emergency department (1.34 [1.06-1.70]), having six or more primary care visits (1.44 [1.14-1.83]), and having eight or more primary care visits (1.66 [1.22-2.25]). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the findings of previous studies, CAM use appears to be associated with increased likelihood of receipt of preventive care services and increased emergency department and primary care visits. CAM use may not be a barrier to use of conventional medical services in adults with diabetes.	Garrow, Donald;Egede, Leonard E	2006 Jan
16371493	Effects of brief yoga exercises and motivational preparatory interventions in distance runners: results of a controlled trial.	OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of two preparatory interventions on one mile run performance in 90 high school long distance runners. METHOD: After participants had completed a one mile baseline run, they were randomly assigned to participate in either one of two interventions (brief yoga exercises, motivational shouting exercises) or a no intervention control condition. Experimental conditions were implemented one week after the baseline run about 20 minutes before a second one mile trial. RESULTS: Participants assigned to the motivational intervention improved their running performance significantly more than those assigned to the other two conditions. Although the magnitude of the effect was small, participants assigned to yoga exercises showed significant improvements in running performance relative to control condition participants. Consumer satisfaction ratings indicated that participants who were assigned to the motivational and yoga exercise groups liked their interventions more than those assigned to the control group. CONCLUSION: Motivational and yoga interventions designed to improve long distance running performance were equally acceptable to the participants, but the former had a greater effect.

16365466	Comparing yoga, exercise, and a self-care book for chronic low back pain: a randomized, controlled trial.	BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain is a common problem that has only modestly effective treatment options. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether yoga is more effective than conventional therapeutic exercise or a self-care book for patients with chronic low back pain. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: A nonprofit, integrated health care system. PATIENTS: 101 adults with chronic low back pain. INTERVENTION: 12-week sessions of yoga or conventional therapeutic exercise classes or a self-care book. MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcomes were back-related functional status (modified 24-point Roland Disability Scale) and "bothersomeness" of pain (11-point numerical scale). The primary time point was 12 weeks. Clinically significant change was considered to be 2.5 points on the functional status scale and 1.5 points on the bothersomeness scale. Secondary outcomes were days of restricted activity, general health status, and medication use. RESULTS: After adjustment for baseline values, back-related function in the yoga group was superior to the book and exercise groups at 12 weeks (yoga vs. book: mean difference, -3.4 [95% CI, -5.1 to - 1.6] [P < 0.001]; yoga vs. exercise: mean difference, -1.8 [CI, -3.5 to - 0.1] [P = 0.034]). No significant differences in symptom bothersomeness were found between any 2 groups at 12 weeks; at 26 weeks, the yoga group was superior to the book group with respect to this measure (mean difference, -2.2 [CI, -3.2 to - 1.2]; P < 0.001). At 26 weeks, back-related function in the yoga group was superior to the book group (mean difference, -3.6 [CI, -5.4 to - 1.8]; P < 0.001). LIMITATIONS: Participants in this study were followed for only 26 weeks after randomization. Only 1 instructor delivered each intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Yoga was more effective than a self-care book for improving function and reducing chronic low back pain, and the benefits persisted for at least several months.

16357724	Section 4: treating the patient in pain.	Physicians may choose from a variety of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options to treat patients with painful rheumatic diseases. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis requiring pain management. New disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologic response modifiers can improve disease states in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). After the inflammatory component of RA is minimized with such agents, treatment goals shift to those similar to secondary OA and other degenerative joint diseases. Relief of pain and improvement in functional status are essential components of effective therapy. A pure analgesic such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, including the cyclooxygenase-2-selective inhibitors for those at risk for gastrointestinal side effects, may be used at the lowest effective doses. Combination therapy for acetaminophen and an opioid may maximize pain relief and provide greater speed and duration of action than the separate components. Use of the atypical opioid tramadol with acetaminophen often results in an improved side-effect profile compared with stronger opioids, with similar levels of pain relief. Adjunctive therapy with agents such as topical analgesics, intraarticular hyaluron, tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, muscle relaxants, and anxiolytics may also be helpful. Nonpharmacologic therapies such as exercise, physical therapy, and psychologic counseling may also diminish pain and improve outcome in patients with rheumatic diseases. One may also consider yoga, acupuncture, biofeedback, massage, relaxation techniques, and other alternative therapies.	Katz, Warren A;Rothenberg, Russell	2005 Apr
16338199	Guggul for hyperlipidemia: a review by the Natural Standard Research Collaboration.	OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the scientific evidence on guggul for hyperlipidemia including expert opinion, folkloric precedent, history, pharmacology, kinetics/dynamics, interactions, adverse effects, toxicology, and dosing. METHODS: Electronic searches were conducted in nine databases, 20 additional journals (not indexed in common databases), and bibliographies from 50 selected secondary references. No restrictions were placed on language or quality of publications. All literature collected pertained to efficacy in humans, dosing, precautions, adverse effects, use in pregnancy/lactation, interactions, alteration of laboratory assays, and mechanism of action. Standardized inclusion/exclusion criteria were utilized for selection. RESULTS: Before 2003, most scientific evidence suggested that guggulipid elicits significant reductions in serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglycerides, as well as elevations in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) [Kotiyal JP, Bisht DB, Singh DS.

However, most published studies were small and methodologically flawed. In August 2003, a well-designed trial reported small significant increases in serum LDL levels associated with the use of guggul compared to placebo [Szapary PO, Wolfe ML, Bloedon LT, et al. Guggulipid for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia: a randomized controlled trial. JAMA 2003;290(6):765-72]. No significant changes in total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or triglycerides were measured. These results are consistent with two prior published case reports [Das Gupta R. Gugulipid: pro-lipaemic effect. J Assoc Physicians India 1990;38(12):346]. CONCLUSION: The effects of guggulipid in patients with high cholesterol are not clear, with some studies finding cholesterol-lowering effects, and other research suggesting no benefits. At this time, there is not enough scientific evidence to support the use of guggul for any medical condition. Guggul may cause stomach discomfort or allergic rash as well as other serious side effects and interactions. It should be avoided in pregnant or breast-feeding women and in children. Safety of use beyond 4 months has not been well studied.

16325942	Beneficial effect of deep breathing on premature ventricular complexes: can it be related to the decrease in QT dispersion?	It has been reported that deep breathing at 6 breaths/min is associated with reduction of premature ventricular complexes. The beneficial effect of deep breathing is supposed to be due to vagal modulation of sinoatrial and atrioventricular node. Beside the modulating effects of deep breathing, we believe that deep breathing, which is also used in yoga training, might have additional effects via decreasing QT dispersion.

16322810	Treatment expectations for CAM interventions in pediatric chronic pain patients and their parents.	Patient expectations regarding complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interventions have important implications for treatment adherence, attrition and clinical outcome. Little is known, however, about parent and child treatment expectations regarding CAM approaches for pediatric chronic pain problems. The present study examined ratings of the expected benefits of CAM (i.e. hypnosis, massage, acupuncture, yoga and relaxation) and conventional medicine (i.e. medications, surgery) interventions in 45 children (32 girls; mean age = 13.8 years +/- 2.5) and parents (39 mothers) presenting for treatment at a specialty clinic for chronic pediatric pain. Among children, medications and relaxation were expected to be significantly more helpful than the remaining approaches (P < 0.01). However, children expected the three lowest rated interventions, acupuncture, surgery and hypnosis, to be of equal benefit. Results among parents were similar to those found in children but there were fewer significant differences between ratings of the various interventions. Only surgery was expected by parents to be significantly less helpful than the other approaches (P < 0.01). When parent and child perceptions were compared, parents expected hypnosis, acupuncture and yoga, to be more beneficial than did children, whereas children expected surgery to be more helpful than did parents (P < 0.01). Overall, children expected the benefits of CAM to be fairly low with parents' expectations only somewhat more positive. The current findings suggest that educational efforts directed at enhancing treatment expectations regarding CAM, particularly among children with chronic pain, are warranted.

16322413	Risk indices associated with the insulin resistance syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and possible protection with yoga: a systematic review.	OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review of published literature regarding the effects of yoga, a promising mind-body therapy, on specific anthropometric and physiologic indices of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and on related clinical endpoints. METHODS: We performed a literature search using 4 computerized English and Indian scientific databases. The search was restricted to original studies (1970 to 2004) evaluating the effects of yoga on CVD or indices of CVD risk associated with the insulin resistance syndrome (IRS). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), nonrandomized controlled trials, uncontrolled (pre and post) clinical trials, and cross-sectional (observational) studies were included if they met specific criteria. Data were extracted regarding study design, setting, population size and characteristics, intervention type and duration, comparison group or condition, outcome assessment, data analysis and presentation, follow-up, and key results, and the quality of each study was evaluated according to specific predetermined criteria. RESULTS: We identified 70 eligible studies, including 1 observational study, 26 uncontrolled clinical trials, 21 nonrandomized controlled clinical trials, and 22 RCTs. Together, the reported results of these studies indicate beneficial changes overall in several IRS-related indices of CVD risk, including glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, lipid profiles, anthropometric characteristics, blood pressure, oxidative stress, coagulation profiles, sympathetic activation, and cardiovagal function, as well as improvement in several clinical endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these studies suggest that yoga may reduce many IRS-related risk factors for CVD, may improve clinical outcomes, and may aid in the management of CVD and other IRS-related conditions. However, the methodologic and other limitations characterizing most of these studies preclude drawing firm conclusions. Additional high quality RCTs are needed to confirm and further elucidate the effects of standardized yoga programs on specific indices of CVD risk and related clinical endpoints.

16321355	Site-specific N-glycosylation analysis of human plasma ceruloplasmin using liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.	Ceruloplasmin has ferroxidase activity and plays an essential role in iron metabolism. In this study, a site-specific glycosylation analysis of human ceruloplasmin (CP) was carried out using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). A tryptic digest of carboxymethylated CP was subjected to LC-ESI-MS/MS. Product ion spectra acquired data-dependently were used for both distinction of the glycopeptides from the peptides using the carbohydrate B-ions, such as m/z 204 (HexNAc) and m/z 366 (HexHexNAc), and identification of the peptide moiety of the glycopeptide based on the presence of the b- and y-series ions derived from the peptide. Oligosaccharide composition was deduced from the molecular weight calculated from the observed mass of the glycopeptide and theoretical mass of the peptide. Of the seven potential N-glycosylation sites, four (Asn119, Asn339, Asn378, and Asn743) were occupied by a sialylated biantennary or triantennary oligosaccharide with fucose residues (0, 1, or 2). A small amount of sialylated tetraantennary oligosaccharide was detected. Exoglycosidase digestion suggested that fucose residues were linked to reducing end GlcNAc in biantennary oligosaccharides and to reducing end and/or alpha1-3 to outer arms GlcNAc in triantennary oligosaccharides and that roughly one of the antennas in triantennary oligosaccharides was alpha2-3 sialylated and occasionally alpha1-3 fucosylated at GlcNAc.

16319785	Rapid stress reduction and anxiolysis among distressed women as a consequence of a three-month intensive yoga program.	BACKGROUND: Emotional distress is an increasing public health problem and Hatha yoga has been claimed to induce stress reduction and empowerment in practicing subjects. We aimed to evaluate potential effects of Iyengar Hatha yoga on perceived stress and associated psychological outcomes in mentally distressed women. MATERIAL/METHODS: A controlled prospective non-randomized study was conducted in 24 self-referred female subjects (mean age 37.9+/-7.3 years) who perceived themselves as emotionally distressed. Subjects were offered participation in one of two subsequential 3-months yoga programs. Group 1 (n=16) participated in the first class, group 2 (n=8) served as a waiting list control. During the yoga course, subjects attended two-weekly 90-min Iyengar yoga classes. Outcome was assessed on entry and after 3 months by Cohen Perceived Stress Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Profile of Mood States, CESD-Depression Scale, Bf-S/Bf-S' Well-Being Scales, Freiburg Complaint List and ratings of physical well-being. Salivary cortisol levels were measured before and after an evening yoga class in a second sample. RESULTS: Compared to waiting-list, women who participated in the yoga-training demonstrated pronounced and significant improvements in perceived stress (P<0.02), State and Trait Anxiety (P<0.02 and P<0.01, respectively), well-being (P<0.01), vigor (P<0.02), fatigue (P<0.02) and depression (P<0.05). Physical well-being also increased (P<0.01), and those subjects suffering from headache or back pain reported marked pain relief. Salivary cortisol decreased significantly after participation in a yoga class (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Women suffering from mental distress participating in a 3-month Iyengar yoga class show significant improvements on measures of stress and psychological outcomes. Further investigation of yoga with respect to prevention and treatment of stress-related disease and of underlying mechanism is warranted.

16308632	[Some considerations about nurses' use of non traditional therapies in psychiatric nursing care].	In this work, a revision of the literature was carried out to identify articles that described non traditional therapeutic modalities psychiatric nurses can use in their daily practice. The described modalities were Music, Motor Activity, Therapeutic Accompaniment and Yoga. Music is able to reconstruct identities, integrate people, reduce anxiety and provide the construction of positive self-esteem. Motor Activity increases self-esteem, reduces inactivity and increases the participation of the psychiatric patient in other activities. In Therapeutic Accompaniment, nurses follow patients in daily routine with a view to their reintegration in the different situations they have to face. Yoga allows for improved memory, reduces emotional tension, depression, anxiety and irritability, and promotes relaxation and a greater feeling of self-control. All activities should be integrated in a global therapeutic plan for each user and be part of daily service programming.	Andrade, Rubia Laine de Paula;Pedrao, Luiz Jorge	2005 Sep-Oct
16306493	Yoga for anxiety: a systematic review of the research evidence.	Between March and June 2004, a systematic review was carried out of the research evidence on the effectiveness of yoga for the treatment of anxiety and anxiety disorders. Eight studies were reviewed. They reported positive results, although there were many methodological inadequacies. Owing to the diversity of conditions treated and poor quality of most of the studies, it is not possible to say that yoga is effective in treating anxiety or anxiety disorders in general. However, there are encouraging results, particularly with obsessive compulsive disorder. Further well conducted research is necessary which may be most productive if focused on specific anxiety disorders.	Kirkwood, G;Rampes, H;Tuffrey, V;Richardson, J;Pilkington, K	2005 Dec
16266947	Deflection, acceleration, and force corridors for small females in side impacts.	OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to develop biomechanical corridors applicable to the small-sized female in side impacts. METHODS: Sled tests were conducted using post mortem human subjects at a velocity of 6.7 m/s. Three chestbands were used to compute deflection-time histories at the axilla, xyphoid process, and tenth rib levels. Triaxial accelerometers were fixed to the upper and lower spine and sacrum to record acceleration-time histories. Specimens contacted the load wall with varying initial conditions (rigid and padded; flat wall and offset) from which impact forces to the thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic regions were obtained using load cell data. Adopting signal processing and mass-based scaling methods, corridors were derived for forces, accelerations, and chest deflections at three levels for all initial conditions. RESULTS: All time history corridors were expressed as mean plus/minus one standard deviation and provided in the article. CONCLUSIONS: Acceleration-, deflection-, and force-time corridors obtained for the chest and pelvic regions of the human body will assist in the assessment of anthropomorphic test devices used in crashworthiness evaluations.

16239082	Role of in vivo passage on the environmental adaptation of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7: cross-induction of the viable but nonculturable state by osmotic and oxidative stresses.	In an enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 outbreak caused by salted salmon roe that occurred in Japan, 1998, a food isolate (F2) was NaCl-resistant and a patient isolate (P5) was sensitive to NaCl. We show here that hydrogen peroxide, like NaCl, induced a significant loss of culturability in P5. The BacLight assay suggested that the EHEC O157:H7 entered a viable but nonculturable (VNC) state. We used the passage through mice in an attempt to model this transition in phenotype. Mouse-passaged isogenic variants of F2 became NaCl- and oxidation-sensitive, entered the nonculturable state in response to either of these stresses, and could be resuscitated by sodium pyruvate. Since the expression of RpoS in response to these stresses correlated with the isolates' culturabilities, we concluded that in vivo passage negatively modulated RpoS expression, and the subsequent stress exposure induced the VNC state in the EHEC O157:H7 isolates.

16236009	Dance as a therapy for cancer prevention.	Even though the field of medicine has developed tremendously, the wide variety of cancer is still among chronic and life threatening disease today. Therefore, the specialists constantly research and try every possible way to find cure or preventive ways to stop its further development. For this reason, studies concerning the chronic disease such as cancer have been spread to many different fields. In this regard, many other alternative ways besides medicine, are used in prevention of cancer. Nutritional therapy, herbal therapy, sportive activities, art therapy, music therapy, dance therapy, imagery, yoga and acupuncture can be given as examples. Among these, dance/movement therapy which deals with individuals physical, emotional, cognitive as well as social integration is widely used as a popular form of physical activity. The physical benefits of dance therapy as exercise are well documented. Studies have shown that physical activity is known to increase special neurotransmitter substances in the brain (endorphins), which create a state of well-being. And total body movement such as dance enhances the functions of other body systems, such as circulatory, respiratory, skeletal, and muscular systems. Regarding its unique connection to the field of medicine, many researches have been undertaken on the effects of dance/movement therapy in special settings with physical problems such as amputations, traumatic brain injury, and stroke, chronic illnesses such as anorexia, bulimia, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, cystic fibrosis, heart disease, diabetes, asthma, AIDS, and arthritis. Today dance/movement therapy is a well recognized form of complementary therapy used in hospitals as well as at the comprehensive clinical cancer centres.	Aktas, Gurbuz;Ogce, Filiz	2005 Jul-Sep
16215879	Public attitudes toward psychiatric treatment. An international comparison.	AIM: In order to examine whether there is a relationship between the state of mental health care and the acceptance of psychiatry, public attitudes toward psychiatric treatment in three countries where the reform of mental health care has progressed to a different degree will be compared. METHODS: Population surveys on public beliefs about mental illness and attitudes toward psychiatric treatment were conducted in Bratislava, Slovak Republic, and Novosibirsk, Russia. The data were compared with those from a population survey that had recently been carried out in Germany. In all three surveys, the same sampling procedure and fully structured interview were applied. RESULTS: Although respondents from all three countries were equally inclined to seek help from mental health professionals, those from Bratislava and Novosibirsk tended to recommend more frequently to address other medical or nonmedical professionals or members of the lay support system. In all three countries, psychotherapy was the most favored treatment modality, followed by psychotropic medication. Although natural remedies were more frequently recommended in Bratislava and Novosibirsk, meditation/yoga was more popular among the German public. Across all three countries, the endorsement of a brain disease as cause was associated with a greater willingness to seek help from medical professionals (psychiatrist, GP). Respondents who adopted biological causes tended to recommend psychotropic medication more frequently. CONCLUSION: In countries with less developed mental health care systems, there appears to be a tendency of the public toward more frequently relying on helping sources outside the mental health sector and on traditional "alternative" treatment methods. However, it is our prognosis that with the progress of reforms observed, differences may further decrease.

16199387	Moving toward a theory of normative influences: how perceived benefits and similarity moderate the impact of descriptive norms on behaviors.	In recent years researchers have focused attention on understanding the role of normative factors in influencing behaviors. Although there is some evidence to support the idea that restructuring normative beliefs can result in behavior change, the norms literature is largely silent about how or why this influence occurs. The theory of normative social behavior describes the moderators of the descriptive norm-behavior relationship. Through a 2 (descriptive norms: high or low) x 2 (perceived benefits: high or low) x 2 (similarity: high or low) between-subjects experiment (N = 174), we tested whether these cognitive mechanisms moderated the norms-behavior link. Results indicated that descriptive norms do not exert a direct influence on behavior. Rather, perceived benefits moderated the relationship between descriptive norms and behavioral intention and perceived similarity moderated the relation between descriptive norms and self-efficacy.

16194185	Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction as supportive therapy in cancer care: systematic review.	AIM: This paper reports a systematic review and critical appraisal of the evidence on the effectiveness of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction for cancer supportive care. BACKGROUND: The experience of cancer can have a negative impact on both psychological and physical health and on quality of life. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction is a therapy package that has been used with patients with a variety of conditions. In order to draw conclusions on its effectiveness for cancer patients, the evidence requires systematic assessment. METHODS: A comprehensive search of major biomedical and specialist complementary medicine databases was conducted. Additionally, efforts were made to identify unpublished and ongoing research. Relevant research was categorized by study type and appraised according to study design. Clinical commentaries were obtained for each study and included in the review. RESULTS: Three randomized controlled clinical trials and seven uncontrolled clinical trials were found. A lack of relevant qualitative research studies was identified. Studies report positive results, including improvements in mood, sleep quality and reductions in stress. A dose-response effect has been observed between practice of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and improved outcome. A number of methodological limitations were identified. Modifications to the traditional Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction programme make comparison between studies difficult and a lack of controlled studies precludes any firm conclusion on efficacy. CONCLUSION: Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction has potential as a clinically valuable self-administered intervention for cancer patients. Further research into its efficacy, feasibility and safety for cancer patients in the nursing context is recommended.	Smith, Joanna E;Richardson, Janet;Hoffman, Caroline;Pilkington, Karen	2005 Nov

16185770	Yoga for depression: the research evidence.	BACKGROUND: Yoga-based interventions may prove to be an attractive option for the treatment of depression. The aim of this study is to systematically review the research evidence on the effectiveness of yoga for this indication. METHODS: Searches of the major biomedical databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, ClNAHL, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library were conducted. Specialist complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and the IndMED databases were also searched and efforts made to identify unpublished and ongoing research. Searches were conducted between January and June 2004. Relevant research was categorised by study type and appraised. Clinical commentaries were obtained for studies reporting clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Five randomised controlled trials were located, each of which utilised different forms of yoga interventions and in which the severity of the condition ranged from mild to severe. All trials reported positive findings but methodological details such as method of randomisation, compliance and attrition rates were missing. No adverse effects were reported with the exception of fatigue and breathlessness in participants in one study. LIMITATIONS: No language restrictions were imposed on the searches conducted but no searches of databases in languages other than English were included. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the initial indications are of potentially beneficial effects of yoga interventions on depressive disorders. Variation in interventions, severity and reporting of trial methodology suggests that the findings must be interpreted with caution. Several of the interventions may not be feasible in those with reduced or impaired mobility. Nevertheless, further investigation of yoga as a therapeutic intervention is warranted.

16181950	Effect of a gentle Iyengar yoga program on gait in the elderly: an exploratory study.	OBJECTIVE: To determine if a tailored yoga program could improve age-related changes in hip extension, stride length, and associated indices of gait function in healthy elders, changes that have been linked to increased risk for falls, dependency, and mortality in geriatric populations. DESIGN: Single group pre-post test exploratory study. A 3-dimensional quantitative gait evaluation, including kinematic and kinetic measurements, was performed pre- and postintervention. Changes over time (baseline to postintervention) in primary and secondary outcome variables were assessed using repeated-measures analysis of variance. SETTING: Yoga exercises were performed in an academic medical center (group classes) and in the subjects' homes (yoga home-practice assignments). Pre- and postassessments were performed in a gait laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-three healthy adults (age range, 62-83 y) who were naive to yoga were recruited; 19 participants completed the program. INTERVENTION: An 8-week Iyengar Hatha yoga program specifically tailored to elderly persons and designed to improve lower-body strength and flexibility. Participants attended two 90-minute yoga classes per week, and were asked to complete at least 20 minutes of directed home practice on alternate days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Peak hip extension, average anterior pelvic tilt, and stride length at comfortable walking speed. RESULTS: Peak hip extension and stride length significantly increased (F1,18=15.44, P<.001; F1,18=5.57, P=.03, respectively). We also observed a trend toward reduced average pelvic tilt (F1,18=4.10, P=.06); adjusting for the modifying influence of frequency of home yoga practice strengthened the significance of this association (adjusted F1,17=14.30, P=.001). Both the frequency and duration of yoga home practice showed a strong, linear, dose-response relationship to changes in hip extension and average pelvic tilt. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of this exploratory study suggest that yoga practice may improve hip extension, increase stride length, and decrease anterior pelvic tilt in healthy elders, and that yoga programs tailored to elderly adults may offer a cost-effective means of preventing or reducing age-related changes in these indices of gait function.

16139187	Intracerebral pain processing in a Yoga Master who claims not to feel pain during meditation.	We recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) following noxious laser stimulation in a Yoga Master who claims not to feel pain when meditating. As for background MEG activity, the power of alpha frequency bands peaking at around 10 Hz was much increased during meditation over occipital, parietal and temporal regions, when compared with the non-meditative state, which might mean the subject was very relaxed, though he did not fall asleep, during meditation. Primary pain-related cortical activities recorded from primary (SI) and secondary somatosensory cortices (SII) by MEG were very weak or absent during meditation. As for fMRI recording, there were remarkable changes in levels of activity in the thalamus, SII-insula (mainly the insula) and cingulate cortex between meditation and non-meditation. Activities in all three regions were increased during non-meditation, similar to results in normal subjects. In contrast, activities in all three regions were weaker during meditation, and the level was lower than the baseline in the thalamus. Recent neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies have clarified that the emotional aspect of pain perception mainly involves the insula and cingulate cortex. Though we cannot clearly explain this unusual condition in the Yoga Master, a change of multiple regions relating to pain perception could be responsible, since pain is a complex sensory and emotional experience.

16131297	Sudarshan Kriya Yogic breathing in the treatment of stress, anxiety, and depression. Part II--clinical applications and guidelines.	Yogic breathing is a unique method for balancing the autonomic nervous system and influencing psychologic and stress-related disorders. Part I of this series presented a neurophysiologic theory of the effects of Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY). Part II will review clinical studies, our own clinical observations, and guidelines for the safe and effective use of yoga breath techniques in a wide range of clinical conditions. Although more clinical studies are needed to document the benefits of programs that combine pranayama (yogic breathing) asanas (yoga postures), and meditation, there is sufficient evidence to consider Sudarshan Kriya Yoga to be a beneficial, low-risk, low-cost adjunct to the treatment of stress, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, stress-related medical illnesses, substance abuse, and rehabilitation of criminal offenders. SKY has been used as a public health intervention to alleviate PTSD in survivors of mass disasters. Yoga techniques enhance well-being, mood, attention, mental focus, and stress tolerance. Proper training by a skilled teacher and a 30-minute practice every day will maximize the benefits. Health care providers play a crucial role in encouraging patients to maintain their yoga practices.

16131293	Iyengar yoga for treating symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knees: a pilot study.	OBJECTIVES: The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines for the medical management of osteoarthritis (OA) emphasize the use of nonpharmacologic interventions including exercise. Implementation of an exercise program can be difficult for patients, and little is known about the benefits of alternative therapies such as yoga. The aim of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of using yoga in the tradition of B.K.S. Iyengar to treat the symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee. DESIGN: Participants were instructed in modified Iyengar yoga postures during 90-minute classes once weekly for 8 weeks. SUBJECTS: Participants met ACR criteria for osteoarthritis of the knee and completed a medical history and physical examination, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale 2 (AIMS2), Patient Global Assessment (GA) by Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Physician GA by VAS, and 50-foot Walk Time before and following an 8-week course of yoga instruction. Eleven (11) subjects enrolled, nine completed at least one session and seven (six of whom were obese) had data from pre- and post-course time points available for analysis. RESULTS: Statistically significant reductions in WOMAC Pain, WOMAC Physical Function, and AIMS2 Affect were observed when participants' status were compared to their pre-course status. WOMAC Stiffness, AIMS2 Symptoms, Social and Role, Physician GA, and Patient GA measured trends in improvement of symptoms. No adverse events from treatment were reported. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that yoga may provide a feasible treatment option for previously yoga-naive, obese patients >50 years of age and offers potential reductions in pain and disability caused by knee OA. Future studies should compare yoga to other nonpharmacologic interventions for knee OA, such as patient education or quadriceps-strengthening exercises.

16124391	[Vocal cord dysfunction or bronchial asthma?].	Vocal cord dysfunction (VCD) is a functional laryngeal dysfunction first described in the nineteenth century. It is quite frequent in patients with "refractory" asthma. It is very often treated as a steroid resistant asthma or exercise-induced bronchospasm, leading to unnecessary, aggressive asthma treatment and iatrogenic morbidity. Vocal cord dysfunction causes paradoxical adduction of vocal cords during the inspiratory phase of respiratory cycle, resulting in acute, episodic dyspnea not responding to typical antiasthmatic treatment. Laryngoscopy remains a gold standard for the diagnosis of vocal cord dysfunction. Additional pulmonary function tests may be useful. Fast and appropriate diagnosis of VCD is only possible with close collaboration of laryngologists and asthma specialists. The treatment of dyspnea attack in VCD involves psychological counseling, heliox application and sedative/anxiolytic agents. Long term treatment may include speech therapy, biofeedback, yoga and autohypnosis.	Rutkowski, Ryszard;Rutkowski, Krzysztof	2005 Jun
16122642	The impact of a moderated e-mail discussion group on use of complementary and alternative therapies in subjects with recurrent back pain.	OBJECTIVE: The purpose was to examine whether or not participation in an e-mail discussion group would affect use of selected complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) modalities during an Internet-based, 1-year randomized, controlled trial on back pain management. METHODS: Intervention subjects (n = 190) participated in a closed, moderated e-mail discussion group; control subjects (n = 231) received usual care. At 1 year, we compared CAM use over the previous 6-month period during which intervention subjects had had interactive discussions about them. Differences in CAM use between groups were compared using Chi-square and t-tests. RESULTS: Subjects did not differ statistically between groups (p > 0.05). They were Caucasian (approximately 91%), male (approximately 60%), in their mid-40s, well educated, had approximately 13 years back pain duration, a disability level approximately 10 (Roland-Morris scale: 0-23; 23 = worst), and >80% had used the Internet for greater than a year before the randomized trial. During the study period, only small proportions in either group had initiated use of glucosamine (13% versus 8%), chiropractic services (5% versus 4%), acupuncture (3%, both), yoga (6% versus 4%), or magnets (6%, both). CONCLUSION: Results suggest that participation in interactive discussions over the Internet about these CAM modalities may not affect their use.

16095417	The metabolic cost of hatha yoga.	To determine the metabolic and heart rate (HR) responses of hatha yoga, 26 women (19-40 years old) performed a 30-minute hatha yoga routine of supine lying, sitting, and standing asanas (i.e., postures). Subjects followed identical videotaped sequences of hatha yoga asanas. Mean physiological responses were compared to the physiological responses of resting in a chair and walking on a treadmill at 93.86 m.min(-1) [3.5 miles per hour (mph)]. During the 30-minute hatha yoga routine, mean absolute oxygen consumption (Vo(2)), relative Vo(2), percentage maximal oxygen consumption (%Vo(2)R), metabolic equivalents (METs), energy expenditure, HR, and percentage maximal heart rate (%MHR) were 0.45 L.min(-1), 7.59 ml.kg(-1).min(-1), 14.50%, 2.17 METs, 2.23 kcal.min(-1), 105.29 b.min(-1), and 56.89%, respectively. When compared to resting in a chair, hatha yoga required 114% greater O(2) (L.min(-1)), 111% greater O(2)(ml.kg(-1).min(-1)), 4,294% greater %Vo(2)R, 111% greater METs, 108% greater kcal.min(-1), 24% greater HR, and 24% greater %MHR. When compared to walking at 93.86 m.min(-1), hatha yoga required 54% lower O(2)(L.min(-1)), 53% lower O(2)(ml.kg(-1).min(-1)), 68% lower %Vo(2)R, 53% lower METs, 53% lower kcal.min(-1), 21% lower HR, and 21% lower %MHR. The hatha yoga routine in this study required 14.50% Vo(2)R, which can be considered a very light intensity and significantly lighter than 44.8% Vo(2)R for walking at 93.86 m.min(-1) (3.5 mph). The intensity of hatha yoga may be too low to provide a training stimulus for improving cardiovascular fitness. Although previous research suggests that hatha yoga is an acceptable form of physical activity for enhancing muscular fitness and flexibility, these data demonstrate that hatha yoga may have little, if any, cardiovascular benefit.

16062164	Yoga for cancer patients and survivors.	BACKGROUND: Yoga has been practiced for thousands of years to improve physical and emotional well-being. Empirical research on yoga has been ongoing for several decades, including several recent studies conducted with cancer patients and survivors. METHODS: This review provides a general introduction to yoga and a detailed review of yoga research in cancer. RESULTS: Nine studies conducted with cancer patients and survivors yielded modest improvements in sleep quality, mood, stress, cancer-related distress, cancer-related symptoms, and overall quality of life. Studies conducted in other patient populations and healthy individuals have shown beneficial effects on psychological and somatic symptoms, as well as other aspects of physical function. CONCLUSIONS: Results from the emerging literature on yoga and cancer provide preliminary support for the feasibility and efficacy of yoga interventions for cancer patients, although controlled trials are lacking. Further research is required to determine the reliability of these effects and to identify their underlying mechanisms.	Bower, Julienne E;Woolery, Alison;Sternlieb, Beth;Garet, Deborah	2005 Jul
16053119	Yoga practice is associated with attenuated weight gain in healthy, middle-aged men and women.	BACKGROUND: Yoga is promoted or weight maintenance, but there is little evidence of its efficacy. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether yoga practice is associated with lower mean 10-year weight gain after age 45. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 15,550 adults, aged 53 to 57 years, recruited to the Vitamin and Lifestyle (VITAL) cohort study between 2000 and 2002. MEASUREMENTS: Physical activity (including yoga) during the past 10 years, diet, height, and weight at recruitment and at ages 30 and 45. All measures were based on self-reporting, and past weight was retrospectively ascertained. METHODS: Multiple regression analyses were used to examined covariate-adjusted associations between yoga practice and weight change from age 45 to recruitment, and polychotomous logistic regression was used to examine associations of yoga practice with the relative odds of weight maintenance (within 5%) and weight loss (> 5%) compared to weight gain. RESULTS: Yoga practice for four or more years was associated with a 3.1-lb lower weight gain among normal weight (BMI < 25) participants [9.5 lbs versus 12.6 Ibs] and an 18.5-lb lower weight gain among overweight participants [-5.0 lbs versus 13.5 Ibs] (both P for trend <.001). Among overweight individuals, 4+ years of yoga practice was associated with a relative odds of 1.85 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-5.42) for weight maintenance (within 5%) and 3.88 (95% Cl 1.30-9.88) for weight loss (> 5%) compared to weight gain (P for trend .026 and .003, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Regular yoga practice was associated with attenuated weight gain, most strongly among individuals who were overweight. Although causal inference from this observational study is not possible, results are consistent with the hypothesis that regular yoga practice can benefit individuals who wish to maintain or lose weight.

16019582	Impact of regular meditation practice on EEG activity at rest and during evoked negative emotions.	The main objective of the present investigation was to examine how long-term meditation practice is manifested in EEG activity under conditions of non-emotional arousal (eyes-closed and eyes-open periods, viewing emotionally neutral movie clip) and while experiencing experimentally induced negative emotions (viewing aversive movie clip). The 62-channel EEG was recorded in age-matched control individuals (n=25) and Sahaja Yoga meditators (SYM, n=25). Findings from the non-emotional continuum show that at the lowest level of arousal (eyes closed) SYM manifested larger power values in theta-1 (4-6 Hz), theta-2 (6-8 Hz) and alpha-1 (8-10 Hz) frequency bands. Although increasing arousal desynchronized activity in these bands in both groups, the theta-2 and alpha-1 power in the eyes-open period and alpha-1 power while viewing the neutral clip remained still higher in the SYM. During eyes-closed and eyes-open periods the controls were marked by larger right than left hemisphere power, indexing relatively more active left hemisphere parieto-temporal cortex whereas meditators manifested no hemisphere asymmetry. When contrasted with the neutral, the aversive movie clip yielded significant alpha desynchronization in both groups, reflecting arousing nature of emotional induction. In the control group along with alpha desynchronization affective movie clip synchronized gamma power over anterior cortical sites. This was not seen in the SYM. Overall, the presented report emphasizes that the revealed changes in the electrical brain activity associated with regular meditation practice are dynamical by nature and depend on arousal level. The EEG power findings also provide the first empirical proof of a theoretical assumption that meditators have better capabilities to moderate intensity of emotional arousal.

16013466	Longitudinal impact of mindfulness meditation on illness burden in solid-organ transplant recipients.	BACKGROUND: In 2001, more than 24000 solid-organ transplant surgeries were performed in the United States. Although survival rates have steadily risen over the past 2 decades, transplant recipients commonly experience a myriad of symptoms after transplantation that compromise quality of life. Anxiety, depression, and insomnia frequently occur despite excellent function of the transplanted organ. Use of complementary and alternative medicine has risen sharply over the past 10 years, particularly among people with chronic illnesses. METHODS: Twenty solid-organ transplant recipients were enrolled in a clinical trial of mindfulness-based stress reduction. During the 8-week course, subjects learned various forms of meditation and gentle hatha yoga. Participants were given audiotapes for home practice and maintained practice diaries. Longitudinal analysis focused on the impact of mindfulness-based stress reduction on symptom management, illness intrusion, and transplant-related stressors. RESULTS: Significant improvements in the quality and duration of sleep continued for 6 months after completion of the mindfulness-based stress reduction course. Improvements after the completion of the course were also noted in self-report measures of anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Mindfulness-based stress reduction is an effective treatment in improving the quality and duration of sleep. Because sleep is highly correlated with positive mental health and overall well-being, these findings suggest that mindfulness-based stress reduction has the potential of being an effective, accessible and low-cost intervention that could significantly change transplant recipients' overall health and well-being.

16006832	The effects of yoga on hypertensive persons in Thailand.	To determine the effectiveness of a yoga program on blood pressure and stress, a group of hypertensive patients in Thailand were studied, with the experimental group showing significantly decreased mean stress scores and blood pressure, heart rate, and body mass index levels compared with the control group. Further studies are suggested to determine the effects of yoga on hypertension in Thailand.	McCaffrey, Ruth;Ruknui, Pratum;Hatthakit, Urai;Kasetsomboon, Payao	2005 Jul-Aug
15992230	Complementary and alternative medicine for low-back pain in pregnancy: a cross-sectional survey.	OBJECTIVE: To identify common treatments used for low-back pain (LBP) during pregnancy. DESIGN: A two-part anonymous survey. SETTING/LOCATION: New Haven, Connecticut. SUBJECTS: Pregnant women and providers of prenatal health care (nurse educators, nurse midwives, and obstetricians). RESULTS: We found that the majority of pregnant women who participated in our survey (61.7%) reported that they would accept complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapy as treatment for LBP during pregnancy. Similarly, 61% of providers of prenatal health care in our sample reported that they would consider using CAM as treatment for LBP during pregnancy. Massage (61.4%), acupuncture (44.6%), relaxation (42.6%), yoga (40.6%), and chiropractic (36.6%) were the most common CAM therapies recommended for LBP in pregnancy by the providers of prenatal health care in our sample. CONCLUSIONS: This two-part survey study found that both providers of prenatal health care and pregnant women in New Haven county are likely to use CAM treatments for pregnancy-induced LBP. Further investigation should focus on whether it is a nationwide phenomenon, as well as if various CAM therapies are an efficacious treatment for LBP during pregnancy.

15974336	Oriental approaches to masculine and feminine subtle energy principles.	According to ancient Indian and Chinese texts the subtle energy (prana or chi) flows through several thousand anatomically indistinguishable channels or meridians (nadis). Three channels are especially important (ida, pingala, and sushumna). The ida and pingala channels correlate with left and right uninostril breathing, respectively. Like yin and yang, they are considered to represent the masculine and feminine principles present in all creation irrespective of sex. From this perspective these principles are assumed to be present simultaneously in persons of both sexes. This suggests that any sex-specific effects of uninostril breathing may be associated with sex-based physiological differences, not with 'masculine' and 'feminine' attributes of the channels (and the corresponding nostrils).

15967074	Complementary and alternative medicine in allergy, otitis media, and asthma.	There is growing interest on the part of both patients and providers in the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies to treat allergy, otitis media, and asthma. Research efforts investigating CAM are increasing in frequency and quality. Studies suggest possible efficacy for some vitamin and mineral supplements for allergic diseases; results are less clear in asthmatic patients. The use of polyunsaturated fatty acids appears particularly promising for treatment and even prevention of allergy and asthma conditions. Studies also suggest that probiotic preparations have a role in the treatment of allergic conditions. Xylitol gum, syrup, and lozenges have shown efficacy in treatment of acute otitis media, as have some naturopathic herbal remedies. Preliminary results with studies of yoga and various relaxation therapies for treatment of asthmatics suggest that these therapies may have a role, but further work would be needed to document efficacy and delineate the specific types of interventions most appropriate for particular asthmatic populations.

15945557	Yoga intervention for adults with mild-to-moderate asthma: a pilot study.	BACKGROUND: Preliminary studies investigating yoga and breath work for treating asthma have been promising. Several randomized controlled trials have shown a benefit from yoga postures and breathing vs control, but the control in these cases involved no intervention other than usual care. This study advances the field by providing an active control. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness and feasibility of a yoga and breath work intervention for improving clinical indices and quality of life in adults with mild-to-moderate asthma. METHODS: A randomized, controlled, double-masked clinical trial was conducted between October 1, 2001, and March 31, 2003. Random assignment was made to either a 4-week yoga intervention that included postures and breath work or a stretching control condition. Outcome measures were evaluated at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks and included the Mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, rescue inhaler use, spirometry, symptom diaries, and health care utilization. RESULTS: Sixty-two participants were randomized to the intervention and control groups, and 45 completed the final follow-up measures. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Significant within-group differences in postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second and morning symptom scores were apparent in both groups at 4 and 16 weeks; however, no significant differences between groups were observed on any outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: Iyengar yoga conferred no appreciable benefit in mild-to-moderate asthma. Circumstances under which yoga is of benefit in asthma management, if any, remain to be determined.

15945136	Patterns of dietary supplement usage in demographically diverse older people.	OBJECTIVE: To analyze dietary supplement usage data from 494 older adults, aged 65 to 101 years. SETTING: Community dwellers living independently of institutionalized care. DESIGN: All dietary supplements, including botanicals, were recorded to aid in assessing the health status of older adults. PARTICIPANTS: 1) 224 individuals enrolled in a study that follows the health of persons 85 years and older (oldest-old) in Klamath County, a non-metropolitan area in southern Oregon; 2) 134 participants of oldest-old age living in the metropolitan Portland area, enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of GBE biloba extract (GBE) for dementia prevention; and 3) 136 participants, ages 65-85 years (young-old), also of the Portland area, enrolled in a study of the effects of yoga and exercise on cognition. MEASUREMENTS: Data verified from labels, not from self-report. RESULTS: Of the participants, 70.6% used dietary supplements. Women took supplements more often than men, and usage decreased with age. A greater percentage, 67.4%, of the non-metropolitan oldest-old took supplements, compared to 56.7% of the metropolitan oldest-old. The greatest usage, 89.7%, was in the metropolitan young-olds. All of these percentages exceed those for comparable age groups in national representative surveys. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary supplement usage by older adults in these studies in Oregon exceeded that in other reports and may reflect high interest in complementary and alternative medicine. This report confirms the results of other studies showing that elderly adults, particularly women, use dietary supplements more than other segments of the US population. Researchers and clinicians should be aware of this pattern and potential conflicts with research design or treatment regimen intended for older people.

15937373	Influence of Yoga and Ayurveda on self-rated sleep in a geriatric population.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Sleep in older persons is characterized by decreased ability to stay asleep, resulting in fragmented sleep and reduced daytime alertness. Pharmacological treatment of insomnia in older persons is associated with hazardous side effects. Hence, the present study was designed to compare the effects of Yoga and Ayurveda on the self rated sleep in a geriatric population. METHODS: Of the 120 residents from a home for the aged, 69 were stratified based on age (five year intervals) and randomly allocated to three groups i.e., Yoga (physical postures, relaxation techniques, voluntarily regulated breathing and lectures on yoga philosophy), Ayurveda (a herbal preparation), and Wait-list control (no intervention). The groups were evaluated for self-assessment of sleep over a one week period at baseline, and after three and six months of the respective interventions. RESULTS: The Yoga group showed a significant decrease in the time taken to fall asleep (approximate group average decrease: 10 min, P<0.05), an increase in the total number of hours slept (approximate group average increase: 60 min, P< 0.05) and in the feeling of being rested in the morning based on a rating scale (P<0.05) after six months. The other groups showed no significant change. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: Yoga practice improved different aspects of sleep in a geriatric population.	Manjunath, N K;Telles, Shirley	2005 May
15933869	Cardiac sympathetic denervation precedes neuronal loss in the sympathetic ganglia in Lewy body disease.	Decreased cardiac uptake of meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) on [123I]MIBG myocardial scintigraphy has been reported in Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). We hypothesized that cardiac sympathetic denervation might account for the pathomechanism. To elucidate the extent, frequency and pattern of cardiac sympathetic nerve involvement in Lewy body disease and related neurodegenerative disorders, we immunohistochemically examined heart tissues from patients with PD (n=11), DLB (n=7), DLB with Alzheimer's disease (DLB/AD; n=4), multiple system atrophy (MSA; n=8), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP; n=5), pure AD (n=10) and control subjects (n=5) together with sympathetic ganglia from patients with PD (n=5) and control subjects (n=4), using an antibody against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). TH-immunoreactive nerve fibers in the hearts had almost entirely disappeared in nearly all the patients with PD, DLB and DLB/AD, whereas they were well preserved in all the patients with PSP and pure AD as well as in all except for one patient with MSA. In PD, neurons in the sympathetic ganglia were preserved in all except for one patient. Decreased cardiac uptake of MIBG in Lewy body disease reflects actual cardiac sympathetic denervation, which precedes the neuronal loss in the sympathetic ganglia.

15922179	Systematic review of therapies for osteoarthritis of the hand.	OBJECTIVE: To systematically review published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies in patients with hand osteoarthritis (OA), with an emphasis on trial methodology. METHODS: RCTs published between 1966 and August 2004 were identified by searching several electronic data sources as well as by searching reference lists. Details of study demographics, methodology, quality and outcomes were analyzed. A meta-analysis was planned, if feasible. RESULTS: Thirty-one RCTs evaluating various pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies in hand OA were analyzed in this systematic review. When compared with hip and knee OA, there are surprisingly few published RCTs in hand OA. Generally, these RCTs are of low quality. RCTs are weakened by a lack of consistent case definition and by a lack of standardized outcome assessments. The methods used for randomization, blinding, and allocation concealment were rarely described. The number and location of symptomatic hand joints per treatment group at baseline was usually not stated. The number and location of evaluated hand joints at the end of the study was also usually not stated. A meta-analysis could not be performed since most of the treatments studied did not have more than one identical comparison to allow pooling of the data. CONCLUSION: It is apparent that hand OA is a more complex area in which to study the efficacy of therapies when compared to hip and knee OA. Consensus guidelines are urgently needed to help improve the design and conduct of RCTs in hand OA. Additional RCTs of high quality that follow consensus recommendations are needed to evaluate the wide range of possible therapeutic options available for patients with hand OA.	Towheed, T E	2005 Jun
15895926	The effects of yoga on mood in psychiatric inpatients.	The effects of yoga on mood were examined in 13 psychiatric inpatients at New Hampshire Hospital. Participants completed the Profile of Mood States (POMS) prior to and following participation in a yoga class. Analyses indicated that participants reported significant improvements on all five of the negative emotion factors on the POMS, including tension-anxiety, depression-dejection, anger-hostility, fatigue-inertia, and confusion-bewilderment. There was no significant change on the sixth POMS factor, vigor-activity. Improvements in mood were not related to gender or diagnosis. The results suggest that yoga was associated with improved mood, and may be a useful way of reducing stress during inpatient psychiatric treatment.

15893758	Lightweight low-profile nine-accelerometer package to obtain head angular accelerations in short-duration impacts.	Despite recognizing the importance of angular acceleration in brain injury, computations using data from experimental studies with biological models such as human cadavers have met with varying degrees of success. In this study, a lightweight and a low-profile version of the nine-accelerometer system was developed for applications in head injury evaluations and impact biomechanics tests. The triangular pyramidal nine-accelerometer package (PNAP) is precision-machined out of standard aluminum, is lightweight (65 g), and has a low profile (82 mm base width, 35 mm vertex height). The PNAP assures accurate orthogonal characteristics because all nine accelerometers are pre-aligned and attached before mounting on a human cadaver preparation. The feasibility of using the PNAP in human cadaver head studies is demonstrated by subjecting a specimen to an impact velocity of 8.1 m/s and the resultant angular acceleration peaked at 17 krad/s2. The accuracy and the high fidelity of the PNAP device at high and low angular acceleration levels were demonstrated by comparing the PNAP-derived angular acceleration data with separate tests using the internal nine-accelerometer head of the Hybrid III anthropomorphic test device. Mounting of the PNAP on a biological specimen such as a human cadaver head should yield very accurate angular acceleration data.	Yoganandan, N;Zhang, J;Pintar, F A;King Liu, Y	2006
15889950	Prospective observational study of treatments for unexplained chronic fatigue.	BACKGROUND: Unexplained chronic fatigue is a frequent complaint in primary care. A prospective observational study design was used to evaluate whether certain commonly used therapies for unexplained chronic fatigue may be effective. METHOD: Subjects with unexplained chronic fatigue of unknown etiology for at least 6 months were recruited from the Wisconsin Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Association, primary care clinics, and community chronic fatigue syndrome presentations. The primary outcome measure was change in a 5-question fatigue score from 6 months to 2 years. Self-reported interventions tested included prescribed medications, non-prescribed supplements and herbs, lifestyle changes, alternative therapies, and psychological support. Linear regression analysis was used to test the association of each therapy with the outcome measure after adjusting for statistically significant prognostic factors. RESULTS: 155 subjects provided information on fatigue and treatments at baseline and follow-up. Of these subjects, 87% were female and 79% were middle-aged. The median duration of fatigue was 6.7 years. The percentage of users who found a treatment helpful was greatest for coenzyme Q10 (69% of 13 subjects), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) (65% of 17 subjects), and ginseng (56% of 18 subjects). Treatments at 6 months that predicted subsequent fatigue improvement were vitamins (p = .08), vigorous exercise (p = .09), and yoga (p = .002). Magnesium (p = .002) and support groups (p = .06) were strongly associated with fatigue worsening from 6 months to 2 years. Yoga appeared to be most effective for subjects who did not have unclear thinking associated with the fatigue. CONCLUSION: Certain alternative therapies for unexplained chronic fatigue, especially yoga, deserve testing in randomized controlled trials.	Bentler, Suzanne E;Hartz, Arthur J;Kuhn, Evelyn M	2005 May

15871490	Type II odontoid fracture from frontal impact: case report and biomechanical mechanism of injury.	The authors report a case of Type II odontoid fracture from a frontal impact sustained in the crash of a late-model motor vehicle. They discuss the biomechanical mechanisms of injury after considering patient demographic data, type and use of restraint systems including seatbelt and airbags, crash characteristics, and laboratory-based experimental studies. Multiple factors contributed to the Type II odontoid fracture: the patient's tall stature and intoxicated state; lack of manual three-point seat belt use; obliqueness of the frontal impact; and the most likely preflexed position of the head-neck complex at the time of impact, which led to contact of the parietal region with the A-pillar roof-rail area of the vehicle and resulted in the transfer of the dynamic compressive force associated with lateral bending. Odontoid fractures still occur in individuals involved in late-model motor vehicle frontal crashes, and because this injury occurs secondary to head impact, airbags may not play a major role in mitigating this type of trauma to an unrestrained occupant. It may be more important to use seat belts than to depend on the airbag alone for protection from injury.	Yoganandan, Narayan;Baisden, Jamie L;Maiman, Dennis J;Pintar, Frank A	2005 Apr
15865492	A brief but comprehensive lifestyle education program based on yoga reduces risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus.	OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to study the short-term impact of a brief lifestyle intervention based on yoga on some of the biochemical indicators of risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. DESIGN: The variables of interest were measured at the beginning (day 1) and end (day 10) of the intervention using a pre-post design. SETTING: The study is the result of operational research carried out in our Integral Health Clinic (IHC). The IHC is an outpatient facility which conducts 8-day lifestyle modification programs based on yoga for prevention and management of chronic disease. A new course begins every alternate week of the year. SUBJECTS: The study is based on data collected on 98 subjects (67 male, 31 female), ages 20-74 years, who attended one of our programs. The subjects were a heterogeneous group of patients with hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, and a variety of other illnesses. INTERVENTION: The intervention consisted of asanas (postures), pranayama (breathing exercises), relaxation techniques, group support, individualized advice, lectures and films on the philosophy of yoga and the place of yoga in daily life, meditation, stress management, nutrition, and knowledge about the illness. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome measures were fasting plasma glucose and serum lipoprotein profile. These variables were determined in fasting blood samples, taken on the first and last day of the course. RESULTS: Fasting plasma glucose, serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, very- LDL cholesterol, the ratio of total cholesterol to high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and total triglycerides were significantly lower, and HDL cholesterol significantly higher, on the last day of the course compared to the first day of the course. The changes were more marked in subjects with hyperglycemia or hypercholesterolemia. CONCLUSIONS: The observations suggest that a short lifestyle modification and stress management education program leads to favorable metabolic effects within a period of 9 days.

15865489	Efficacy of yoga on pregnancy outcome.	OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy of yoga on pregnancy outcomes. DESIGN AND SETTING: Three hundred thirty five (335) women attending the antenatal clinic at Gunasheela Surgical and Maternity Hospital in Bangalore, India, were enrolled between 18 and 20 weeks of pregnancy in a prospective, matched, observational study; 169 women in the yoga group and 166 women in the control group. METHODS: Women were matched for age, parity, body weight, and Doppler velocimetry scores of umbilical and uterine arteries. Yoga practices, including physical postures, breathing, and meditation were practiced by the yoga group one hour daily, from the date of entry into the study until delivery. The control group walked 30 minutes twice a day (standard obstetric advice) during the study period. Compliance in both groups was ensured by frequent telephone calls and strict maintenance of an activity diary. MAIN OUTCOMES: Birth weight and gestational age at delivery were primary outcomes. RESULTS: The number of babies with birth weight > or = 2500 grams was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the yoga group. Preterm labor was significantly lower (p < 0.0006) in the yoga group. Complications such as isolated intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) (p < 0.003) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) with associated IUGR (p < 0.025) were also significantly lower in the yoga group. There were no significant adverse effects noted in the yoga group. CONCLUSIONS: An integrated approach to yoga during pregnancy is safe. It improves birth weight, decreases preterm labor, and decreases IUGR either in isolation or associated with PIH, with no increased complications.

15836974	Effect of Iyengar yoga therapy for chronic low back pain.	Low back pain is a significant public health problem and one of the most commonly reported reasons for the use of Complementary Alternative Medicine. A randomized control trial was conducted in subjects with non-specific chronic low back pain comparing Iyengar yoga therapy to an educational control group. Both programs were 16 weeks long. Subjects were primarily self-referred and screened by primary care physicians for study of inclusion/exclusion criteria. The primary outcome for the study was functional disability. Secondary outcomes including present pain intensity, pain medication usage, pain-related attitudes and behaviors, and spinal range of motion were measured before and after the interventions. Subjects had low back pain for 11.2+/-1.54 years and 48% used pain medication. Overall, subjects presented with less pain and lower functional disability than subjects in other published intervention studies for chronic low back pain. Of the 60 subjects enrolled, 42 (70%) completed the study. Multivariate analyses of outcomes in the categories of medical, functional, psychological and behavioral factors indicated that significant differences between groups existed in functional and medical outcomes but not for the psychological or behavioral outcomes. Univariate analyses of medical and functional outcomes revealed significant reductions in pain intensity (64%), functional disability (77%) and pain medication usage (88%) in the yoga group at the post and 3-month follow-up assessments. These preliminary data indicate that the majority of self-referred persons with mild chronic low back pain will comply to and report improvement on medical and functional pain-related outcomes from Iyengar yoga therapy.

15834238	Ayurveda and yoga in cardiovascular diseases.	Ayurveda is derived from 2 Sanskrit words, namely, "Ayus" and "Veda," meaning life and knowledge, respectively. It literally means science of life. Ayurveda, of which yoga is an integral part, is widely practiced in India and is gaining acceptance in many countries around the world. It is a comprehensive and a holistic system, the focus of which is on the body, mind, and consciousness. The Ayurvedic treatment consists of the use herbal preparations, diet, yoga, meditation, and other practices. Based on the review of available studies, the evidence is not convincing that any Ayurvedic herbal treatment is effective in the treatment of heart disease or hypertension. However, the use of certain spices and herbs such as garlic and turmeric in an overall healthy diet is appropriate. Many herbs used by Ayurvedic practitioners show promise and could be appropriate for larger randomized trials. Yoga, an integral part of Ayurveda, has been shown to be useful to patients with heart disease and hypertension. Yoga reduces anxiety, promotes well-being, and improves quality of life. Its safety profile is excellent. Its use as a complementary therapeutic regimen under medical supervision is appropriate and could be worth considering.	Mamtani, Ravinder;Mamtani, Ronac	2005 May-Jun
15825920	Complementary and alternative medicine use by psychiatric inpatients.	82 psychiatric inpatients hospitalized for acute care were interviewed about their use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) modalities. The clinical diagnoses of respondents included Depressive Disorder (61%), Substance Abuse (26%), Schizophrenia (9%), and Anxiety Disorders (5%). Analysis indicated that 63% used at least one CAM modality within the previous 12 mo. The most frequently used modality was herbal therapies (44%), followed by mind-body therapies such as relaxation or mental imagery, hypnosis, meditation, biofeedback (30%), and spiritual healing by another (30%). Physical modalities such as massage, chiropractic treatment, acupuncture, and yoga were used by 21% of respondents. CAM therapies were used for a variety of reasons ranging from treatment of anxiety and depression to weight loss. However, most respondents indicated they did not discuss such use with their psychiatrist or psychotherapist.	Elkins, Gary;Rajab, M Hasan;Marcus, Joel	2005 Feb
15819448	Meditation can reduce habitual responding.	CONTEXT: Although cognitive aspects of meditation underlie much of its clinical application, very little research has examined meditation's cognitive consequences. This investigation provides experimental support for the idea that meditation leads to a reduction in habitual responding using randomly selected subjects, a secular form of meditation, and a full experimental design. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that meditation leads to a reduction in habitual responding. DESIGN: Studies 1 and 2 each incorporated pre-test and post-test designs with a 20-minute intervening attention task (meditation, rest, or a cognitive control). SETTING: Yale University in New Haven, Conn, and the University of California, Berkeley. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and twenty and 90 undergraduates participated in Studies 1 and 2, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Stroop and Word Production (category generation and stem-completion) tasks assessed habitual responding in Study 1. Galvanic Skin response measured arousal in Study 1. The category generation task assessed habitual responding in Study 2. Tellegen's Absorption Scale (TAS) measured attention ability. RESULTS: In Study 1, meditation participants showed a reduction in habitual responding on the Stroop task as compared to controls. Study 1 revealed no statistically significant effects in the word production task. Stroop task performance was not mediated by arousal reduction. In Study 2, meditation participants showed a reduction in habitual responding on the category production task. Specifically, when participants generated either typical or atypical items, on average, meditation participants produced more atypical items than controls. Category production performance was not mediated by Tellegen's Absorption Scale (TAS) scores. Overall, high TAS scores were related to atypical responding. CONCLUSION: Across cognitive tasks, when participants understood that the goal was to respond non-habitually, meditation reduced habitual responding.	Wenk-Sormaz, Heidi	2005 Mar-Apr

15789442	Influence of socioeconomic status on lung function and prediction equations in Indian children.	The present study was carried out to assess the influence of socioeconomic status on lung functions and to suggest prediction equations for Indian children. For this purpose, 2,616 normal, healthy schoolchildren aged between 5-15 years were recruited. Boys were classified into three groups, i.e., high-income (HIG), middle-income (MIG), and low-income (LIG), while girls were classified into HIG and LIG groups, based on socioeconomic status (SES). Height, weight, chest circumference, body surface area (BSA), fat-free mass (FFM), and body fat were assessed. Forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC ratio, and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) were measured. The results, before and after adjustment of physical characteristics, showed that anthropometry, body composition, and lung functions were significantly higher in HIG compared to MIG and LIG children, while in girls, no differences were observed in physical characteristics after adjustments. Multiple linear regression equations were developed to predict FEV1, FVC, and PEFR, using independent variables like age, height, fat-free mass, and SES. It is opined that these equations could be used as Indian reference equations for healthy children based on the SES.

15784204	Odontoid fracture in motor vehicle environments.	The National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) and Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network (CIREN) databases were used in an analysis of odontoid fracture in motor vehicle crashes. NASS data were evaluated for the years 1996-2002, and CIREN from 1996 to 2003. Out of 58 fractures, 38 were identified in the NASS and 20 in the CIREN databases. There were 3108 weighted cases in the NASS database. Frontal impacts (11:00 to 1:00 h) were most commonly associated with the injury in both databases. Although male and female occupants sustained the injury, females were shorter in stature, older in age, lighter in weight, and crashes were less severe (lower change in velocity) when female occupants were involved in trauma. In both databases, pure odontoid fracture and facet/lamina fracture accounted for approximately one-third of the cases, and a majority of impacts were associated with changes in velocity less than 56 km/h. Although vehicle model years ranged from 1976 to 2002, recent model years were more frequently associated with CIREN data. In the CIREN database, type II odontoid fracture was the most common, but no particular mechanism of injury dominated; such information was not available in the NASS database. To ameliorate odontoid fracture, focus should be on frontal impacts. Because different types of odontoid fracture are not included in the current Abbreviated Injury Scale, appropriate coding schemes should be developed to classify this injury. The CIREN database is unique because it provides important clinical information, i.e., fracture type, and the associated mechanism of injury. The mechanism component in any epidemiologically based injury analyses is valuable to advance improvements in vehicle crashworthiness.	Yoganandan, Narayan;Pintar, Frank A	2005 May
15784203	Responses of side impact dummies in sled tests.	Sled tests were conducted at a velocity of 6.7 m/s using side impact dummies (SID, BioSID, ES-2, and WorldSIDp) and the resulting biomechanical responses were compared with responses from post mortem human subjects (PMHS). Initial impact conditions were with and without pelvic offset in combination with and without padding on the impacting wall. Impact forces, thoracic trauma index, chest compression, and viscous criteria were evaluated. The probability of injury was estimated and rates of deformation were computed for each body region. Dummy responses were not always similar in terms of trend and injury criteria when compared with PMHS tests under the same initial conditions. Response variations will be of value in improving the biofidelity characteristics of dummies for crashworthiness evaluations.	Yoganandan, Narayan;Pintar, Frank A	2005 May
15772059	Resistance training increases total daily energy expenditure in disabled older women with coronary heart disease.	Physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) is a determinant of prognosis and fitness in older patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). PAEE and total energy expenditure (TEE) are closely related to fatness, physical function, and metabolic risk in older individuals. The goal of this study was to assess effects of resistance training on PAEE, TEE, and fitness in older women with chronic CHD and physical activity limitations (N = 51, mean age: 72 + 5 yr). The study intervention consisted of a progressive, 6-mo program of resistance training vs. a control group condition of low-intensity yoga and deep breathing. The study interventions were completed by 42 of the 51 participants. The intervention group manifested a 177 +/- 213 kcal/day (+9%) increase in TEE, pre- to posttraining, measured by the doubly labeled water technique during a nonexercise 10-day period (P < 0.03 vs. controls). This was due to a 50 +/- 74 kcal/day (4%) increase in resting metabolic rate measured by indirect calorimetry (P < 0.01, P < 0.05 vs. controls) and a 123 +/- 214 kcal/day (9%) increase in PAEE (P < 0.03, P = 0.12 vs. controls). Resistance training was associated with significant increases in upper and lower body strength, but no change in fat-free mass, measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry, or left ventricular function, measured by echocardiography and Doppler. Women in the control group showed no alterations in TEE or its determinants. There were no changes between groups in body composition, aerobic capacity, or measures of mental depression. These results demonstrate that resistance training of 6-mo duration leads to an increase in TEE and PAEE in older women with chronic CHD.

15750381	Sudarshan Kriya yogic breathing in the treatment of stress, anxiety, and depression: part I-neurophysiologic model.	Mind-body interventions are beneficial in stress-related mental and physical disorders. Current research is finding associations between emotional disorders and vagal tone as indicated by heart rate variability. A neurophysiologic model of yogic breathing proposes to integrate research on yoga with polyvagal theory, vagal stimulation, hyperventilation, and clinical observations. Yogic breathing is a unique method for balancing the autonomic nervous system and influencing psychologic and stress-related disorders. Many studies demonstrate effects of yogic breathing on brain function and physiologic parameters, but the mechanisms have not been clarified. Sudarshan Kriya yoga (SKY), a sequence of specific breathing techniques (ujjayi, bhastrika, and Sudarshan Kriya) can alleviate anxiety, depression, everyday stress, post-traumatic stress, and stress-related medical illnesses. Mechanisms contributing to a state of calm alertness include increased parasympathetic drive, calming of stress response systems, neuroendocrine release of hormones, and thalamic generators. This model has heuristic value, research implications, and clinical applications.	Brown, Richard P;Gerbarg, Patricia L	2005 Feb
15750361	Genomic profiling of neutrophil transcripts in Asian Qigong practitioners: a pilot study in gene regulation by mind-body interaction.	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The great similarity of the genomes of humans and other species stimulated us to search for genes regulated by elements associated with human uniqueness, such as the mind-body interaction. DNA microarray technology offers the advantage of analyzing thousands of genes simultaneously, with the potential to determine healthy phenotypic changes in gene expression. The aim of this study was to determine the genomic profile and function of neutrophils in Falun Gong (FLG, an ancient Chinese Qigong) practitioners, with healthy subjects as controls. SUBJECTS AND DESIGN: Six (6) Asian FLG practitioners and 6 Asian normal healthy controls were recruited for our study. The practitioners have practiced FLG for at least 1 year (range, 1-5 years). The practice includes daily reading of FLG books and daily practice of exercises lasting 1-2 hours. Selected normal healthy controls did not perform Qigong, yoga, t'ai chi, or any other type of mind-body practice, and had not followed any conventional physical exercise program for at least 1 year. Neutrophils were isolated from fresh blood and assayed for gene expression, using microarrays and RNase protection assay (RPA), as well as for function (phagocytosis) and survival (apoptosis). RESULTS: The changes in gene expression of FLG practitioners in contrast to normal healthy controls were characterized by enhanced immunity, downregulation of cellular metabolism, and alteration of apoptotic genes in favor of a rapid resolution of inflammation. The lifespan of normal neutrophils was prolonged, while the inflammatory neutrophils displayed accelerated cell death in FLG practitioners as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Correlating with enhanced immunity reflected by microarray data, neutrophil phagocytosis was significantly increased in Qigong practitioners. Some of the altered genes observed by microarray were confirmed by RPA. CONCLUSION: Qigong practice may regulate immunity, metabolic rate, and cell death, possibly at the transcriptional level. Our pilot study provides the first evidence that Qigong practice may exert transcriptional regulation at a genomic level. New approaches are needed to study how genes are regulated by elements associated with human uniqueness, such as consciousness, cognition, and spirituality.

15733782	Training to yoga respiration selectively increases respiratory sensation in healthy man.	Because yoga practitioners think they are benefiting from their breath training we hypothesized that yoga respiration training (YRT) could modify the respiratory sensation. Yoga respiration (YR) ("ujjai") consisted of very slow, deep breaths (2-3 min(-1)) with sustained breath-hold after each inspiration and expiration. At inclusion in the study and after a 2-month YRT program, we determined in healthy subjects their eupneic ventilatory pattern and their capacity to discriminate external inspiratory resistive loads (respiratory sensation), digital tactile mechanical pressures (somesthetic sensation) and sound-pressure stimulations (auditory sensation). Data were compared to a gender-, age-, and weight-matched control group of healthy subjects who did not undergo the YRT program but were explored at the same epochs. After the 2-month YRT program, the respiratory sensation increased. Thus, both the exponent of the Steven's power law (Psi=kPhin) and the slope of the linear-linear plot between Psi and mouth pressure (Pm) were significantly higher, and the intercept with ordinate axis of the Psi versus Pm relationship was lower. After YRT, the peak Pm developed against inspiratory loads was significantly lower, reducing the load-induced activation of respiratory afferents. YRT induced long-lasting modifications of the ventilatory pattern with a significant lengthening of expiratory duration and a modest tidal volume increase. No significant changes in somesthetic and auditory sensations were noted. In the control group, the respiratory sensation was not modified during a 15-min period of yoga respiration, despite the peak Pm changes in response to added loads were then significantly reduced. These data suggest that training to yoga respiration selectively increases the respiratory sensation, perhaps through its persistent conditioning of the breathing pattern.

15732478	Detection limit estimated from slope of calibration curve: an application to competitive ELISA.	This paper theoretically derives a general rule that while the slope of the semi-logarithmic plot (Y vs. log X) of a calibration curve varies depending on analyte concentration, X, the slope takes a specific value at the detection limit (L(D)). This rule holds good irrespective of the shape of the calibration curve (linear or non-linear) and in this paper, is applied to competitive ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay). The following relationship is deduced: slope of log-dose B/B0 at L(D) = [relative standard deviation (RSD) of blank responses] / 0.13. The L(D) obtained from the above-mentioned slope corresponds to the dose at which the RSD of dose estimates is 0.3 (= 30%). A commercial kit for 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone is taken as an example.

15695478	Patient perspectives: Kundalini yoga meditation techniques for psycho-oncology and as potential therapies for cancer.	The ancient system of Kundalini Yoga (KY) includes a vast array of meditation techniques. Some were discovered to be specific for treating psychiatric disorders and others are supposedly beneficial for treating cancers. To date, 2 clinical trials have been conducted for treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The first was an open uncontrolled trial and the second a single-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a KY protocol against the Relaxation Response and Mindfulness Meditation (RRMM) techniques combined. Both trials showed efficacy on all psychological scales using the KY protocol; however, the RCT showed no efficacy on any scale with the RRMM control group. The KY protocol employed an OCD-specific meditation technique combined with other techniques that are individually specific for anxiety, low energy, fear, anger, meeting mental challenges, and turning negative thoughts into positive thoughts. In addition to OCD symptoms, other symptoms, including anxiety and depression, were also significantly reduced. Elements of the KY protocol other than the OCD-specific technique also may have applications for psycho-oncology patients and are described here. Two depression-specific KY techniques are described that also help combat mental fatigue and low energy. A 7-part protocol is described that would be used in KY practice to affect the full spectrum of emotions and distress that complicate a cancer diagnosis. In addition, there are KY techniques that practitioners have used in treating cancer. These techniques have not yet been subjected to formal clinical trials but are described here as potential adjunctive therapies. A case history demonstrating rapid onset of acute relief of intense fear in a terminal breast cancer patient using a KY technique specific for fear is presented. A second case history is reported for a surviving male diagnosed in 1988 with terminal prostate cancer who has used KY therapy long term as part of a self-directed integrative care approach.

15616123	Site-specific glycosylation analysis of human apolipoprotein B100 using LC/ESI MS/MS.	Human apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100) has 19 potential N-glycosylation sites, and 16 asparagine residues were reported to be occupied by high-mannose type, hybrid type, and monoantennary and biantennary complex type oligosaccharides. In the present study, a site-specific glycosylation analysis of apoB100 was carried out using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI MS/MS). ApoB100 was reduced, carboxymethylated, and then digested by trypsin or chymotrypsin. The complex mixture of peptides and glycopeptides was subjected to LC/ESI MS/MS, where product ion spectra of the molecular ions were acquired data-dependently. The glycopeptide ions were extracted and confirmed by the presence of carbohydrate-specific fragment ions, such as m/z 204 (HexNAc) and 366 (HexHexNAc), in the product ion spectra. The peptide moiety of glycopeptide was determined by the presence of the b- and y-series ions derived from its amino acid sequence in the product ion spectrum, and the oligosaccharide moiety was deduced from the calculated molecular mass of the oligosaccharide. The heterogeneity of carbohydrate structures at 17 glycosylation sites was determined using this methodology. Our data showed that Asn2212, not previously identified as a site of glycosylation, could be glycosylated. It was also revealed that Asn158, 1341, 1350, 3309, and 3331 were occupied by high-mannose type oligosaccharides, and Asn 956, 1496, 2212, 2752, 2955, 3074, 3197, 3438, 3868, 4210, and 4404 were predominantly occupied by mono- or disialylated oligosaccharides. Asn3384, the nearest N-glycosylation site to the LDL-receptor binding site (amino acids 3359-3369), was occupied by a variety of oligosaccharides, including high-mannose, hybrid, and complex types. These results are useful for understanding the structure of LDL particles and oligosaccharide function in LDL-receptor ligand binding.
